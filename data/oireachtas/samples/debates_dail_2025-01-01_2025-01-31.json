On Friday, 17 January, I outlined in correspondence to each member of the Business Committee legal advice that my office had received from the Office of Parliamentary Legal Advisers. In that correspondence, I further sought submissions from those who did not agree with the advice I had outlined. I was explicit in that correspondence that I had made no decision on the issue of the recognition of the Regional Independent Group as a technical group. I invited submissions by close of business yesterday. Those of you who did not agree with the advice had the opportunity to make submissions and provide alternate advice for me to consider. I embarked on this process in the interests of fairness and recognising that Standing Orders could be open to interpretation. As of yesterday, I received one submission on the issue of the Regional Independent Group. I thank the authors of that submission. Overnight, I considered the submission and the advice that I received. I reviewed and discussed the submission with my staff.",

Therefore, in accordance with my solemn declaration that I will apply the rules as laid down by this House in an impartial and fair manner and the powers conferred on me by Standing Order 75(3), I have decided that to avoid prejudging my final decision on that dispute, the following technical groups will be recognised for the purposes of any debate during today's proceedings pending a final ruling on the matter: Independent and Parties Technical Group; and Independent Technical Group. I trust my decision today provides a roadmap for all parties and all Members to work towards an outcome that is acceptable to all. Thank you.",

The Government believes our Dáil is ever evolving and that standing orders should evolve to reflect the membership and groupings of the House. The Government will today bring forward a motion to establish the Committee on Standing Orders and Dáil Reform, to fully engage with the committee and to work to secure agreement, as soon as possible and acceptable to Government and Opposition, as regards formation of technical groups and the rights of unaligned Members. The Government is fully committed to working with all parties and none in the committee to make the required changes that are fair not only to Members of this current Dáil but also to future Dáileanna in the years ahead. We will aim to have this resolved by 5 February."

                "We are not in agreement with the postponement and with the Dáil not meeting again until 5 February. In the past, when there was a break after a new Government was formed, that was in different circumstances when a new Government came together very quickly after the election. It is now almost two months since the election so there has been ample time for people to prepare and so forth. I suggest that if the Ministers are not ready to face the Dáil next week, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste certainly would be."

We see the substance of a leader who has made a real difference. He was a reforming and dynamic Minister for education who put in place policies which have reduced early school leaving, increased literacy and dramatically expanded access to further and higher education. As Minister for health, he pushed forward new national strategies which transformed treatment in critical areas and he implemented a public health revolution which has saved tens of thousands of lives and inspired 74 other countries to follow Ireland's lead. As Minister for enterprise, he created new areas of activity which made Ireland an international leader in key areas and underpinned hundreds of thousands of jobs. As Minister for Foreign Affairs on two occasions, he represented Ireland with distinction, promoting the core values of peace, co-operation and humanitarian aid.",
                "Of course, as Taoiseach, we saw his great strength as he led us through a terrible pandemic and recession which threatened many lives and livelihoods. In those dark days filled with great uncertainty and fear he never faltered. He spent countless hours working to find ways of helping people and responding to once-in-a-century problems. He spoke clearly and directly with the Irish people at all times, sharing with them the information available to him and offering hope that we would come through to better days.",

During that election, Deputy Micheál Martin and Fianna Fáil campaigned on the basis of a positive campaign and a positive message of leading our country forward, and the Irish people responded. They gave him the largest and clearest mandate of any party or leader.",
                "Since then, he has worked to build a coalition government based on respect and a detailed programme. It brings together different priorities of a shared commitment to action over the next five years. Each of us who had the privilege of canvassing with Deputy Martin during the election saw at first hand the direct connection he had with the people - his ability to find ways of addressing their concerns and his sincere determination that we both celebrate success and never lose focus on the urgent challenges of today.",

Tuigim an fhreagracht mhór atá orm agus tá mé réidh le tabhairt fúithi le díograis agus le dúthracht. Ag an am céanna, tá mé muiníneach go bhfuil ceannaire den scoth againn i dTeachta Micheál Martin. Tá a chumas, taithí agus tiomantas do mhuintir na hÉireann léirithe go soiléir aige thar na blianta. Tá se cróga, ciallmhar agus dírithe ar na réitigh atá de dhíth orainn mar náisiún. Tá fís láidir aige don tír seo agus níl aon dabht orm ach go mbeidh sé ina Thaoiseach a dhéanfaidh an-difríocht, a chuirfidh ár leas chun cinn agus a sheasfaidh le dúthracht do gach saoránach.",
                "We never know what challenges will arise but what I do know is that with Micheál Martin as Taoiseach, we will have a leader who is ready to face them head on. His dedication, experience and unwavering commitment to progress will be invaluable as we navigate the road ahead. I am excited and optimistic for the future under his leadership. I believe we will continue to work tirelessly to create a better Ireland for all."

                "Deputy Micheál Martin has served the Irish people with honour and commitment during his distinguished career. He has overcome many challenges and shown himself to be one of the most important, influential and successful democratic representatives of these times. He has shown an unwavering belief in the value of working constructively, respecting others and seeking to solve problems, not to exploit them. He has shown a command of diverse public issues and the ability to respond to new concerns. He has shown that he has broad and deep support among the Irish people. Over the years, he has paid many visits to my constituency of Dublin South-Central. Away from the cameras he spent many hours talking at ease with communities about the issues facing them. He has always taken the time not just to listen but, importantly, to engage, understand and seek ways to help.",
                "People see the sincerity and the commitment. As colleagues will confirm, Deputy Martin is the same wherever he goes and whomever he is meeting. This, above all, is what lies at the core of his connection with the Irish people and played a key role in Fianna Fáil's success in November's election. He has, above all, demonstrated that he will lead the new Government with determination and will strengthen our country's position in Europe and the world.",
                "Having secured the most votes and the most seats in our free democratic election, he did not sit back and expect to be handed the Taoiseach's office. No, he showed respect for the mandates of other democratic representatives and led our party in detailed negotiations. He succeeded in securing a majority for a new Government based on an ambitious programme for moving our country forward. Surely the first qualification to serve as Taoiseach is to show the ability to work with people and build co-operation across political lines.",
                "During Micheál Martin's time as Taoiseach, from June 2020, he served our country well at an historically difficult moment. He took office right at the height of the worst pandemic in modern times, with our hospitals full of patients with a virus we did not know how to prevent or treat and with hundreds of thousands of people unemployed. He was head of a very uncertain Government which many commentators predicted would find it almost impossible to function. Due in large part to his leadership, it was a focused and effective period of government. Members of that Government have confirmed that he operated a policy of working with all the Ministers on promoting action and policies irrespective of who would claim the credit. I have heard many stories from Ministers, senior and junior, that his door was always open to them and that he would help them overcome obstacles wherever they appeared.",
                "Perhaps the greatest demonstration of Deputy Martin's approach to holding high office was seen as he worked tirelessly to secure a share of new vaccines, which were the key to restoring social and economic life. In Europe and globally he lobbied other leaders and businesses for Ireland. Every day, he pushed within his Government to develop an unprecedented programme that could rapidly distribute the vaccines. Once he succeeded in this, he then took his place in the queue along with his fellow citizens.",

Indeed, one of the first Bills that this Government is committed to bringing forward is to increase the allowances for these junior Ministers but it did not stop there. You tried to pull a political stroke of huge magnitude - that sham where you tried to create the impression that Independent TDs who negotiated the programme for Government, who signed up for it in good days and in bad days, got to sit in the Opposition benches and use Opposition time.",
                "We cannot forget, can we, Micheál, who was behind this grubby deal of Government in the first instance? It was Deputy Michael Lowry, the star of the Moriarty tribunal, which found that Michael Lowry received over €1 million in direct payments and loan supports from Denis O'Brien, whom he was instrumental, as Minister, in delivering a State licensing contract to. Deputy Lowry, in the Tánaiste's words, \"not only influenced, but delivered, the result\", \"engaged in a \"cynical and venal abuse of office\" and \"he was involved in attempting to influence an arrangement that was \"profoundly corrupt to a degree that was nothing short of breathtaking\". Those are the Tánaiste's words. The Tánaiste called him a rogue politician; now he welcomes him back into the bosom of government. Deputy Lowry is a Government-supporting TD and the Tánaiste has pursued facilitating him with speaking time.",
                "I wonder if Deputy Lowry will use that speaking time to come clean to set the record straight about his involvement in the Doncaster deal, which was the purchase of Doncaster football club funded by Denis O'Brien, a deal that the Deputy swore that the had no part in and was not to benefit from, which was completely and utterly false. Let me put some new information on the record of the House. Deputy Lowry had 57 meetings in relation to the Doncaster deal, including here in the Houses of the Oireachtas, with the organisers of the project and representatives of sport. He also had meetings in the boardroom of Doncaster football club itself. Will Deputy Lowry also explain why, in September and October of 2001, his accountant and his adviser paid the person putting the Doncaster deal together two bank drafts of Stg£32,500 and Stg£25,000 for his fee? When he is doing that, maybe he will explain why these payments came from an account in Gibraltar and where they originated from. These payments were never disclosed to the tribunal. Will Deputy Lowry use the Government's time to explain to this House and the public why he, on 15 March 2001, met with other key individuals in relation to this deal in Dublin?",
                "The outcome of the meeting was the creation of a false narrative and fake new documents. These fake documents were given to the tribunal. Maybe he could explain why he, it is claimed, with two others who were central to these deals met on a rural farm in August 2002 to burn the original documents pertaining to these deals. He did so to make sure that the truth would never see the light of day. The information I am now telling the Tánaiste comes directly from one of the men present. Michael Lowry has been found by the tribunal. When Micheál Martin called on the Taoiseach at the time, Enda Kenny, to reopen the investigation into Michael Lowry it was because of some information that came from the same individual who has given me this information. How does he square the circle? Back then he wanted Michael Lowry investigated and now he wants him in the bosom of government. Now he allows Deputy Lowry to play the part of king maker. Now he hands him substantial influence over this Government. Maybe the next time Deputy Martin sits down with Michael Lowry to discuss his grubby government deal-----"

The State has never been richer but so many of our people - working people - are left behind. I grew up in Dublin in the 1980s and things were tough but never in my worst nightmares did I think that the soul of our city would carry the weight of so many sleeping bags in doorways, cardboard boxes for shelter, tents lining our canals, and homeless hubs as refuge for so many families. The housing and homeless crisis crystallises the unfair society that all of you have created. Working people go to soup kitchens, families struggle for the basics, children wait in agony for life-changing operations, and trolleys line overcrowded hospitals. Why is it that in a country that is so wealthy nothing seems to work? The answer is \"Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael\". You have no excuses left. The resources are there yet your programme for Government is simply a charter for more of the same and a blueprint for further crises. You have no clear plans to deliver on childcare or to change the lives of low and middle-income workers, there is no clear timeline to address the issues for carers, and there is only a passing interest in the future of our country and the reunification of our island. All you have is a selection of promises, promises that have all been made before and promises that have all been broken before.",

Our motivation remains that one day in the not too distant future we will have a government for working people, a government that ensures that people have a home, that they can see a doctor when they are sick, that childcare is affordable and that they have living costs that do not break the bank, and a government to restore the hope in our young people that they can have their opportunity for a good and decent future here in their own country.

It is fair to say that I could sense you were somewhat nurturing a mild desire to be Taoiseach again and I sincerely want to congratulate you on that achievement.

It is an ambitious plan to drive our country forward but it is also a plan to keep our country safe and secure. The Fine Gael Party is looking forward to playing our part in the new Government in a spirit of partnership, mutual respect and shared objectives. There is much work to do and we are eager to hit the ground running. For my own part I am excited to play a leadership role as Tánaiste in the first half of the Government and I pledge to work relentlessly on delivering the programme for Government in the interests of the people.

There is a context to the formation of every Government. For example, the last Government in 2020 was undoubtedly formed in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, and the previous one in 2016 faced a combination of an Irish economic recovery, a looming Brexit and a very fragmented election result.",
                "On this occasion, there is no doubt the context is one of global geopolitical change and the very real challenge that presents. In this context and at a time when incumbent governments are losing power around the world, the Irish people delivered a mandate for stability and sensible leadership. Of course, there is a great need to make progress on our own domestic challenges, particularly in the areas of housing, health and disability. There is good reason, as my own party enters an historic fourth consecutive term of government, to believe that we can deliver both that essential progress and the protection of our economy in the face of potentially harsh headwinds. We in Fine Gael have worked in successive partnership Governments with the Labour Party, Independents, the Green Party and Fianna Fáil to deliver for our country even in times of emergency. Looking towards the next five years, these are the qualities that must characterise the next Government because for the Irish people, the challenges I just mentioned, particularly in housing and disability, are nothing short of emergencies and they want to see a Government meet them with the mantra \"delivery, delivery, delivery\".",
                "While it is clear that a period of some economic instability may lie ahead, our public finances are in a position to ensure we can make key progress on increasing infrastructure delivery and improving public services. In particular, we can bring a new energy to the delivery of the infrastructure – water, energy, transport and housing – needed to support the development of our country and societies.",

That was the core democratic principle that we, across the Opposition, united on yesterday. The situation in the Dáil yesterday was deeply regrettable but it should never have come to that. This was a chaos of the Government's own making. I am glad that the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste reached out in the end and that we had a leaders' meeting this morning and were able to resolve things, as we had sought to do. It is important that we have done that and can move on because the Government has an important task. The success of this Government will be for the betterment of all in Irish society. Instead of going into a two-week recess, we should be convening the Dáil next week so that we can fulfil our constitutional duty to hold the Government to account from the Opposition benches. The Government should now be actively engaging in bringing about the change so badly needed by the communities that we all serve and represent.",

If you parse that document, there is no sense of any acceptance at all of a need for change. There is no indication as to how the Government will deliver on the few new commitments or aspirations set out. Indeed, many of the measures in the programme will see us going backwards. There is nothing there on how the Government is going to achieve the ramped-up delivery homes that we all know is so badly needed. Instead, we are seeing more outsourcing of housing. There is nothing to strengthen renters' rights. The Government has even ignored its own Housing Commission's recommendations. There is no sense here of a radical reset on housing policy. It is welcome that the climate targets are retained but no meaningful pathway is set out for how we achieve them. What is worse is the slashing of funds for cycling, public transport and sustainable transport in favour of building more roads."

Where is the urgency in the programme for Government to tackle this? During the election campaign, we were told by the Government that 40,000 homes would be built last year. When the Taoiseach, Deputy Simon Harris, was asked what his source for this information was, he said it was the housing Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien. The CSO today confirmed that only 30,000 homes were built last year.",
                "Disabled people are forced to fight tooth and nail for what most of us are able to take for granted, including the chance to go to a local school, have jobs, live independently and access public services. Disabled people and their families must battle from the day they are born. It is shameful that their biggest battle is often with the State to try to get basic services like an assessment of need, essential therapies or a school place. Previous Governments have repeatedly said that disability services were a priority. If that were true, it would be reflected in the make-up of the Cabinet. There should be a stand-alone, senior Minister for disability, someone with real political power who can focus solely on disability with the resources needed to ensure that disabled people can participate fully in society as equals.",
                "On climate, we have no real idea of how this Government intends to meet its targets and avoid up to €20 billion in EU fines by 2030. We need to invest now in renewable energy, public transport and a fair transition, rather than wasting billions in fines in five years' time. We need to see a retrofitting revolution with grant reforms that make it accessible for those on low and middle incomes. Climate action is often presented as a negative. However, investment will result in a clean environment, cheaper energy and smaller bills. For years, the previous Government used one-off payment to address the cost-of-living crisis. It never worked because it did not address the underlying issue. The best way to bring costs down is to invest in quality public services and climate action. Investment in healthcare, education, childcare, public transport and clean energy would drive costs down and pay dividends in the future.",
                "We cannot allow threats, implied or otherwise, from other countries to influence our foreign policy or stop us from standing up for human rights and international law and against genocide. The ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages are very welcome. However, there must be accountability for genocide and crimes against humanity. In addition, the incoming Government cannot be allowed to renege on commitments to enact the occupied territories Bill. There was cross-party consensus during the election that we needed to enact this crucial legislation. Now the Government is talking about progressing new, weaker legislation. It is totally unjust for Palestinian families to be evicted from their homes and farms to make way for illegal Israeli settlements. We need to enact strong legislation that shows Ireland stands firmly for the application of international law and the principles of justice and peace.",

However, when parties that claim to be on the left put forward policies to erode the tax base and undermine funding for public services, we will not be silent about it.",

While some of Independent Ireland's policies are being adopted, such as the appointment of a Minister for fisheries and the marine, a full rejection of the Mercosur deal and a decrease in the VAT rate to 9%, which has now been promised in the programme for Government, the detail is still very vague. For the many hospitality businesses that have closed their doors, it is too little too late. The omissions from the programme for Government are alarming. These include a freeze on carbon tax increases. This has now been forgotten by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Independents who signed up to this agreement. This is a hammer blow to the ordinary men and women who have to go about their daily business. It is a blow to the haulier who is supplying goods throughout the country and who, with every increase, will have to up the price of hauling goods to our shops.

The declaration of a housing emergency should bring power over county development plans back to the people and allow planning in urban and rural communities. The Government did not take on board Independent Ireland's policies on deadlines for wastewater treatment plant completions, an issue that leaves communities all over the country without the infrastructure needed to build. Its housing targets and the housing targets of all other political parties in this Dáil will lie in tatters at the end of this year because homes cannot be built without proper infrastructure. Last week's announcement that 64,000 houses had been started in 2024 was fake news. The facts have been revealed today. There were 6.7% fewer houses built last year, only 30,330. There is no vision in this Government to resolve this issue. One of our main proposals in health was that a medical card be given to all cancer patients for the duration of their treatment. It is unfortunate that this was refused. I wish Deputy Martin well. I look forward to being constructive in opposition in the years ahead."

A lot of the Ministries should be taken out of Dublin so they can reflect areas around the country where infrastructure is badly needed. A Dublin-based Cabinet has not worked. On health and infrastructure, we have seen failure. We have also seen failure in the number of houses delivered because of the lack of infrastructure. If there were any sports games on today, all the field positions would be covered. Ireland should be looked at in that way.

I had hoped that might happen a little bit later but this is far from a visionary programme for government document. It is an insipid artificial vanilla programme for paralysis that is devoid of any roadmap or tangible targets. Tá sé gan fuinneamh, gan treo, gan dóchas, gan chostálacha agus go mórmhór gan chomhbhá. It shows no compassion. This is no Seamus Heaney moment where \"hope and history rhyme\". It is more like good old Gilbert O'Sullivan, where nothing rhymes. In fact, Chappell Roan comes to mind painting a picture of what it will be like in five years' time:",

In that regard, we face billions of euro in fines on our taxpayers. Equally important is the energy crisis. We need to be self-sufficient in energy but we are going to face massive imports. I also mention the occupied territories Bill. The list is endless.",

It is the nature of politics that the focus is mostly on the few of us who achieve office, but the role of those who work with and for us is central. I want to thank those who work for our party and have kept our voice and our representation so strong. They never believed the predictions and had faith that our people and our policies would prevail. I also want to thank the many friends and colleagues who have helped me over the years and who, with typical Cork modesty, advocate on a regular basis for the well-being of my home city and county. As they have grown, my children Micheál Aodh, Aoibhe and Cillian have moved from being observers to being pillars for me. They are unflinching in their advice and constant in their support. I have been blessed to have a partner in Mary who has done so much more than just keeping me rooted. No position I have held, and nothing I have achieved, would have been possible without her.",

This week every year, I remember all he did for us and the values he lived by every day. A strong and athletic sporting man, he was also quiet and determined in the small and large steps he took every day to help others. The Córas Iompair Éireann, CIE, widow and orphans fund, which he founded, helping hundreds of families at tough times of the year, was just one example of his commitment to turning values into action. Ours was a home where service to the wider community and an understanding of shared responsibility within society was always the defining value.",

I reject this. I believe in the good faith of those who seek to serve their communities in elective office, and I believe that politics remains a force for good - a force for positive change.

For my part, I intend to remain open to constructive ideas from Deputies from all parts of the House.",
                "When nominating members of the new Government, I will address more specific policy points, but it is important to state the core principles on which I intend to lead the Government. When reflecting on the legacy of republicanism from the 1916 generation of which he was a part, Seán Lemass always stressed the idea of responding to the needs of today and shaping the future. For him, true republicanism was not about following the past, it was about a willingness to move on and create new ways forward. He summed this up with his favourite quote from Pádraig Pearse - “every generation has its task”. For us today, for this generation of political leaders, the task is to protect Ireland’s strength at a moment of real threat, while also addressing critical social needs.",
                "By any reasonable measure, this is a challenging moment in world history. Ireland is an open democracy with an open economy. We cannot expect to stand unaffected on the sidelines. We must protect and renew an economic model which delivers high employment and resources for public services. Central to this we must strengthen our three essential relationships with Europe, with the United States and with the United Kingdom. Europe is the essential foundation upon which we rely. This week marks the anniversary of the day Jack Lynch and Patrick Hillery signalled our commitment to a European future by signing the Treaty of Accession. The Government I lead will work every day in the same spirit. We will work to help reform and strengthen the European Union. We will work with others to overcome urgent economic, environmental and political challenges which threaten our shared interests and values. We will not flinch in our support for protecting Europe’s freedom and democracy.",
                "Our relationship of kinship with the United States is older than our State. It has endured because we have continued to renew bonds of respect and co-operation. We are not naive about the realities of change but, equally, the Ireland-America relationship is one which benefits us both and it will emerge strongly no matter what. The United Kingdom remains a close social, cultural and economic neighbour for us, and we will begin operating a new systematic approach to consultation and co-operation. Internationally, we will be an active voice for the values of peace, co-operation and development. We will follow the profoundly welcome ceasefire in Gaza with a sustained programme of humanitarian and reconstruction aid. We will do this through co-operation with the World Food Programme and UNRWA.",
                "Protecting and renewing Ireland’s economic strength and standing in the world must, as I have said, also be accompanied by sustained action on other urgent needs. Sixty years ago this month Seán Lemass went to Stormont to meet Terence O’Neill. They agreed that we should be able to promote our constitutional objectives while also working together for shared development. It is a great tragedy that their new departure then was not allowed to achieve more. The new Government will push forward on the historic task of building a lasting reconciliation. We will implement the largest ever programme of North-South research and investment, opening critical links and building both engagement and understanding through a further strengthened shared island initiative.",
                "Too many people are struggling to afford a home to buy or rent. Helping them will be a priority for the new Government and for the Dáil. Too many people with disabilities and their families have to fight too hard to access the services they deserve. We must begin a new era in support for them, not just increasing resources but step-changing the scale, nature and delivery of services. This is not the work of one Minister, it must be the work of every part of Government and of this Oireachtas. We must deliver both resources and reform to help all our children to get the best start in life, through smaller classes, community development programmes and targeting resources to help families experiencing poverty. We must protect nature and biodiversity and move forward in tackling the existential problem of climate change.",
                "In all of this, the Government I will lead will reject the sterile politics of the extremes, the empty gestures of those who want to impose inflexible ideologies when addressing issues which are as complex and diverse as our people. Mine will be a Government which seeks to work in a spirit of practical republicanism - a spirit which has helped our country achieve so much in the past and which is essential if we are to meet the challenges of today; a spirit which will create equality of opportunity for all, which will work to underpin and promote the status, dignity and independence of people with disabilities; a spirit that will build more houses at an accelerated pace and that will work every day to build reconciliation between the different traditions on the island of Ireland.",

                "The legislation required to give effect to this will be introduced without delay.",
                "The Government that I am nominating today is a Government that will work every day to protect Ireland’s strength at this moment of real threat, and it will also take sustained action to address critical social needs. Each member of the new Government will have responsibility for a distinct programme of action but each will also be required to actively contribute to the Government’s core priorities. A whole-of-government approach, taking key issues out of departmental silos and delivering action on multiple fronts at once, will be a defining characteristic of the Government’s work. In a number of priority areas, a series of new co-ordination mechanisms will be put in place that will be led from the Taoiseach’s office.",
                "We can all see that there is growing turbulence in the world and there are very real threats to institutions that are fundamentally important for Ireland. A core priority for the Government will be to protect and strengthen Ireland’s position within the European Union and in wider international fora. As a fundamental part of this, we must protect the trade which is vital to our economy and the institutions which are vital to promoting our values. We will join with others in seeking to strengthen the EU, complete essential economic reforms within the Union and insist on its democratic values.",
                "We will also seek to accelerate the opening of new markets and expand the opportunities for Irish companies to prosper through trade. We will further emphasise the importance of trade to our international diplomacy. In order to underpin this, the trade function will transfer to the newly renamed Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, which will be led by the new Tánaiste, Deputy Simon Harris.",
                "Next year, we will assume the rotating Presidency of the Council. We will use our Presidency to promote a positive agenda of concrete actions across a range of social, economic, political and environmental fields. It will be a Presidency defined by action.",
                "The Minister of State with responsibility for Europe will be assigned to both the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. He will play a central role in planning for the Presidency and also implementing a range of permanent measures that will deepen the contacts between Ireland and our fellow member states.",
                "Everyone who believes in the cause of peace and basic values must hope that the ceasefire in Gaza holds and that we can quickly move to a massive programme of humanitarian aid and reconstruction. Gaza is, however, one part of a wider and deeply troubling development where civilians are increasingly targeted in conflicts, and the impacts are escalating. We can see it in Russia’s savage war against Ukraine, in the decade of atrocities committed by the Assad regime and Russia in Syria and in Sudan. In our aid programme and in our work globally, this Government will be a leading voice in building alliances to challenge this appalling drift in recent conflicts and wars.",
                "The development of a new relationship with the United Kingdom is also a vital part of our work. We will begin holding regular, formal summits to promote active co-ordination. Each Minister will be tasked with building bilateral relations to replace those that were once a routine part of shared membership of the European Union.",
                "Moving forward, the work of building a lasting peace and reconciliation on our island will continue to be led by me through the shared island initiative. The unit co-ordinating the initiative will be strengthened and we will implement a major expansion in the actions covered by the initiative. We will seek to work closely and constructively with the democratic representatives of the people of Northern Ireland, and aiding the effective working of the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement will form part of the work of every member of the new Government.",
                "A strong economy that supports high employment and funds public services must never be taken for granted. Ireland has succeeded in the past because we have kept evolving and we have understood that we must work to shape our economy’s direction and capacity. We will retain strong public finances, including the provision of reserve funds that can protect investment programmes and protect services in tougher times, but we will also deliver a comprehensive programme of investment in both services and infrastructure.",
                "In order to ensure that we deliver major projects efficiently, cost-effectively and faster, the structure and operation of the Department of Public Expenditure, NDP Delivery and Reform will be significantly reformed and strengthened. A new infrastructure division will be established and headed by an official at deputy Secretary General level. The unit, together with its Ministers, will have responsibility to remove unreasonable roadblocks to essential projects, strengthening expert oversight and ensuring that investment programmes are implemented without delay.",
                "The new Government will also work to support Irish businesses, not only to find new markets but also to reduce costs. A roadmap for long-term stability and growth for small and medium-sized industry is an early priority which will include extensive research and consultation. As part of this, and recognising the importance of tourism to much of our economy, the tourism function is being transferred to the Department of enterprise.",
                "The Minister for higher and further education and research will lead an effort to ensure that we maximise the economic impact of the investment we make in those sectors. We will ensure that we secure their financial foundations and implement measures to systematically consider the science and research dimensions of Government initiatives. We will plan and work on a major new initiative in the research field.",
                "Education will be as important to shaping our future as it has been in shaping our past. We will move forward with a programme of modernisation and reform that will go hand in hand with increased resources that go directly to classrooms in every community in our country.",
                "I am determined that this will be a Government that step-changes the level and scale of support for people with disabilities and their families. Existing approaches will not achieve the breakthroughs we need and it is time to move beyond them. Disability will be represented at Cabinet by a full Minister for the first time in our history. The Minister will have responsibility for many services and will lead cross-government action. This will include a new model of delivery for vital therapies. In order to reinforce this work, a new disability unit will be established in my Department.",
                "I am determined that we will begin a new era of community development. In rural, provincial and urban areas, many challenges can only be met if we bring together all relevant agencies, work with the communities and develop interventions targeted specifically at each community’s distinct needs. The Minister for Social Protection will lead this work but all Departments will contribute.",
                "Ensuring the safety of our communities, the ability to walk the streets or to be in your own home without fear is a fundamental responsibility of Government. We need to improve the level and impact of community policing, and we need to address new forms of behaviour which are causing great damage. The Department of Justice will be significantly reformed to make sure that it is focused on our programme of action. In addition, we will address the fact that Government activity on migration is too dispersed and requires more direct leadership. A new division of the Department of Justice will take responsibility for the control of our borders, management of immigration and co-ordination of integration. This will be headed by a Secretary General with a distinct budget and more direct oversight.",
                "We understand the enormous pressures and difficult circumstances of many of our citizens who cannot find a secure home to buy or rent. Accelerating the number of homes available and delivering direct support to people is critical to our work. We will ramp up investment in the required infrastructure and I will shortly announce details of a new co-ordination and implementation group that will operate from my Department.",
                "Rural communities and the agrifood sector remain a vital part of our social, economic and cultural life. We will work to deliver a sustainable and prosperous future for them. Recognising the importance of fishing and the marine, I will appoint a dedicated Minister of State to lead investment in this sector.",
                "The achievement of climate and biodiversity goals is not just a challenge for this Government and Dáil; it is the defining challenge of our age. The scale of investment we need to transform to a green economy means that we must step-change investment, both public and private. Based on an approach that has been successful in financial services, I will establish a new climate investment clearing house that will initially focus on energy transformation.",
                "Both during the pandemic and in the years since, we have shown that reform and progress are possible in health.",
                "The full benefits of major reforms, such as the new consultant contract and service development, will only be fully felt in the next few years. However, we have to also look for ways to transform how we run our health services, not just administratively but, more importantly, in how we treat individual patients. A programme of health digitalisation is central to this transformation. Its implementation is a priority for us and work will begin without delay.",
                "Each member of the new Government will have clear responsibilities for delivering on the ambitious programme we have set out. It will be an outward-looking Government, one which is focused on protecting our economy and delivering sustained progress in housing and education, in helping communities, in transforming services for people with disabilities and in many other areas.",
                "Our country has shown time and again just how much it can achieve. In building one of the longest continuous democracies in the world, we have overcome many great challenges. I have great faith in our strengths and I have no doubt that we can, working together with a positive agenda of change, move our country forward together."

                "I congratulate the Taoiseach, Deputy Micheál Martin, on his election and appointment as Taoiseach of our country and Government. I congratulate all colleagues in Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and Independents who are assuming ministerial office today and others who will assume ministerial office in the days to come. I very much look forward to working together in partnership for the next five years. We have much to do.",
                "It is clear to me from the very detailed and thorough negotiations we undertook on the programme for Government that we have a very strong, shared understanding of the scale of work we must do and the scale of delivery we must achieve. Between us, we have a very clear mandate from the Irish people, which I believe is summed up in one word, \"delivery\". This has been re-emphasised by our parties, in the case of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, in an extraordinarily strong endorsement through our respective ratification processes. Where my party is concerned, we had a new process for the first time, which entailed five regional meetings right across the country and which really energised me and the elected members of our parliamentary party as we embark on this new Government.",
                "For Fine Gael and the Fine Gael Ministers appointed here today entering a fourth consecutive term in government, we are very conscious that this is an historic opportunity. We feel the weight of our responsibility keenly and we are looking forward to serving the country to the best of our abilities. Personally, I am deeply honoured to be appointed Tánaiste, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and Minister for Defence at a time when I consider these to be critical portfolios for the continuing success and the future security of our country. Ireland's place in the world has never been more important. We are a small, open economy and that model has served us extremely well. We are also a proud and active member of the European Union, with the many advantages of the Single Market. We are, however, much more than just an economy. Ireland believes in multilateralism and international law and we will always use our voice to stand up for what is right, be that in Ukraine, the Middle East or our work through the excellent Irish Aid in the global south.",
                "As Tánaiste, I will continue the expansion of our diplomatic strengths through Global Ireland. We will not only increase the breadth of our influence by opening new missions but, crucially, we will also increase the depth of our influence with new skills and focus in our existing embassies and consulates, particularly trade depth. In the coming hours, I will convene a trade conference of all of our consulates and our embassy in the United States with the sole focus of engaging with the thousands of decision-makers of the Trump Administration and ensuring that they know the two-way relationship and strength of Irish investment in the United States. The United States is vital, but we will also bring new focus to the untapped potential of our diplomatic and trade relations across India, the Far East and South America. We will continue to protect our citizens abroad through the meticulous consular work that is carried out and the online transformation of the passport service.",
                "We have no more important sets of relationships that the ones on these islands. The British-Irish reset has worked. It is under way. Our Governments are working closely together as partners, and that will be evident in the first intergovernmental summit. A new group of Ministers here in new roles will prioritise meeting their counterparts in Northern Ireland to ensure that every opportunity to work together is taken. I travel to Belfast all the time, but will officially travel to Belfast in my new role in the coming days for a round of official meetings. We are putting effort into our relationship, but we are also putting money into projects and infrastructure that matter through the shared island fund the Taoiseach referenced. Our bridge-building will be both physical and philosophical. Ireland will host the biggest international gathering of leaders that has ever come to our shores next year. As well as the EU Presidency, we will welcome 40 presidents and prime ministers for a summit of the European political community. I will prioritise the planning and execution of this, and a Presidency that showcases our country, while steering the EU agenda in 2026.",
                "The Defence Forces is an institution that goes above and beyond. It serves Ireland with distinction every single day. When a naval ship sails over the horizon, when our Air Corps aircraft fly out of sight or when a battalion of peacekeeping troops leaves Dublin Airport, they may leave our immediate consciousness, but for the men and women of the only army in Ireland, the work has just begun. They do that work with skill, dedication and honour. I want thousands more young people to consider serving their country, community and families through a career in the Defence Forces. To achieve this, the biggest transformation in the Defence Forces' history needs to be followed through on. Investment has increased. Working conditions and pay have been improved. Together there is much more to do. Being militarily neutral but still having the ability to protect ourselves are not contradictory. We are investing in new aircraft, radar, equipment and vessels. We also need the biggest investment ever undertaken in facilities at our Army barracks, at Casement Aerodrome and Haulbowline.",
                "On policy, Ireland will fully participate at EU level on all matters of defence. Our allies and colleagues in eastern Europe are under attack. Physical war rages on our Continent and cyberwar and espionage threaten us all. Defence cannot be an added extra and must remain at the heart of policymaking.",
                "I move now to my Fine Gael ministerial colleagues who have the honour of being appointed to office today. I congratulate our deputy leader, Deputy Helen McEntee, on being appointed the Minister for Education and Youth, where I know she will prioritise a workforce plan for the sector, oversee increased capitation to schools, establish a new DEIS plus scheme to support schools with the highest level of educational disadvantage, the creation of a dedicated national therapy service in education, and continue to increase the number of special schools and special classes across the country.",
                "I congratulate Deputy Paschal Donohoe on being appointed Minister for Finance again. His primary priority will be the overarching essential of ensuring the economic security of our State with a strong enterprise and fiscal framework which will prioritise economic and employment growth, competitiveness, fiscal responsibility and investment in innovation, energy and decarbonisation. He will, working with Cabinet colleagues, prepare and submit a new medium-term fiscal plan, which will set out sustainable budgetary plans for the next five years, and will, working with the Minister, Deputy Chambers, bring forward in the next budget a range of measures to help our small and medium businesses and help to contain energy costs for businesses and households.",
                "I sincerely congratulate Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill on her appointment as Minister for Health. She will oversee an absolute game-changer in marrying resources with reform by bringing forward multi-annual funding for our health service, developing a new workforce plan for Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services and advancing a statutory home care scheme for old people. I know she will also build on the significant progress which has already been made in transforming women's healthcare.",
                "I am delighted to congratulate Deputy Martin Heydon on being appointed Minister for Agriculture, Food, Fisheries and the Marine, a role I know he will take on with great experience and energy. He will have many priorities in the time ahead but I want, in particular, to highlight the work I want him to undertake on Ireland's nitrates derogation renewal plan, on implementing an audit of all farm schemes with the intention of cutting red tape for farmers and in ensuring a farm succession scheme which supports generation renewal.",
                "I congratulate Deputy Patrick O'Donovan on his appointment as Minister for Arts, Culture, Communications, Media and Sport, where his priority actions will be working with the Minister for Justice on the passage of a defamation Bill, ensuring stable funding for RTÉ and other public service broadcasters and accessible funding for local radio and print media, the redevelopment of our GPO, examining the feasibility of the minor capital works grants scheme to support arts and cultural facilities that are not funded through the Arts Council and continuing the vital roll-out of the national broadband plan.",
                "I congratulate Deputy Peter Burke on being reappointed as Minister for enterprise, but this time as Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Employment, where his key priorities will be the publication of a whole-of-government action plan on competitiveness and productivity within the first year, launching The Year of the Invitation as a new tourism initiative, and publishing and implementing a new national tourism policy until 2030.",
                "Crucially, we have agreed the establishment of a new small business unit in the Department to help bring a dedicated focus to this area.",
                "I congratulate Deputy Naughton on being appointed a Minister of State attending Cabinet with responsibility for disability, which will be a vital role for all of us in government working across key Ministries to deliver the step change required in disability services. The Minister of State's priorities will be the publication and funding of a new national disability strategy; working in partnership with disabled people and their representative organisations to co-design improvements to services; identifying measures to attract and retain staff and developing a new work force plan for the sector; implementing the action plan for disability services; reforming the Disability Act 2005; and implementing the autism innovation strategy.",
                "I commend and congratulate all Ministers, from the Fine Gael Party, the Fianna Fáil Party and Independents. I am excited to work with each of them in their respective briefs.",
                "Aside from the individual ministerial portfolios I have highlighted, we face a number of key collective challenges that, as I said earlier, the public wishes us to address with renewed energy and focus. The need to make further progress on housing is intrinsic to the social contract in this country. It was a priority for all parties in the programme for Government talks and will be driven by us with a relentless focus on delivery, delivery, delivery. We will work together to bring a new focus to delivering the infrastructure required to bring our country to the next stage of its development and enable faster delivery of housing and much more. We will work together to prioritise investments across the justice system, recruiting at least 5,000 additional gardaí and building stronger, safer communities. This Government will be ambitious on climate action to decarbonise the economy, continue to reduce emissions and lead a revolution in renewable energy in pursuit of energy independence, while ensuring energy security, protecting nature and promoting a circular economy. Most importantly, at a time our country and our world yearn for stability, this is a Government that will deliver five budgets. That is vital and that is our mandate. We will continue to have the fundamental commitment to deliver at all costs.",
                "I believe we have got the balance right between investment and reform. We stand at the outset of a five-year term that will see significant advances in the social, economic and environmental goals we share and fulfilment of the mandate given to us by the Irish people. For my own part, I am excited and energised to play a leadership role as Tánaiste and to work with this talented team of people. I pledge to work relentlessly on delivering the programme for Government in the interests of the people of this great country. Go raibh maith agaibh."

                "All of a sudden, I am transported back to 2020. The Tánaiste spoke of a balanced programme. I have to say what is manifest and obvious: you have got the gender balance wrong. You are very male. Some of you are pale but you are very, very male. In politics in a representative democracy, we should strive to reflect and mirror the communities we represent, inasmuch as we can. I have to say as an Irishwoman, leaving aside that I am a parliamentarian, I find it kind of depressing that again we see the absence of us. I want to put that on the record.",
                "The Taoiseach said he has \"a positive agenda for change\" and that we face historic opportunities. He is always good at grandiose claims at the beginning of the game of politics. I am old enough to remember that last time he told us housing was the priority and that he would sort out housing, and that he had heard the electorate and recognised how bad things were. That is what he said and pledged. Where are we now? Many are struggling to put an affordable, secure roof over their heads. There are sky-high house prices and extortionate rents, and those in need of council housing are spending years and years on waiting lists. The Taoiseach presides over a shameful level of homelessness. We have structural, ongoing, growing homelessness in Ireland at a rate none of us imagined or dreamt of. That is the Government parties' record on housing. That is what they have done. If that was their priority, and that was their best shot at their priority over five years, then God help us if we see what a mediocre performance on issues they do not care about looks like.",
                "People cannot get the healthcare they need when they need it. Our hospitals and accident and emergency departments are constantly overcrowded. Hundreds of thousands of people languish on treatment waiting lists. The trolley crisis is now a daily occurrence; it is mundane. It is taken as read, day in, day out. It is nearly impossible to get a GP or dentist appointment. That is the Government parties' record on health. Working parents fork out the equivalent of a second mortgage on childcare fees. There is a serious lack of places in the system. There has been no real demonstration of respect and advancement for early childhood educators and childcare workers, and thousands of children are on waiting lists. Stress, worry, pressure is the Government parties' record on childcare. Households continue to struggle to make it to the end of the week, light and heat their homes and put food on the table, with soaring grocery bills and rip-off insurance costs, never mind the rent or mortgage. Hard-working people see their wages go out as quickly as they come in, sometimes more quickly. That is the Government parties' record on the cost of living.",
                "All these problems existed when Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael clubbed together in 2020 and they are still with us today, worse than before, a testament to their collective failure. Being entrusted with ministerial office is a big responsibility and I genuinely wish anybody determined to make a real and positive difference well. However, mark this: without a radical change of policy and approach, the Cabinet announced tonight will amount only to a rearranging of the deckchairs. As this Government takes office, I have no doubt ordinary people face more of the same. For anybody who believed the leopard had finally changed its spots, the cynical approach to Government formation taken by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the so-called Independents surely disabused them of that notion. Instead of focusing on the challenges facing our people, they wrangled over the rotation of Taoiseach, who got which ministerial office and who got the big meeting room in Leinster House. They turned their attention, in other words, to feathering their own nests.",
                "Now it feels like a bumper season of \"The Late Late Show\" for you lot with a Ministry for everyone in the audience: more super junior Ministers, more junior Ministers, more expenses for Ministers. This smacks of entitlement. It is the largest number of junior Ministers in the history of the State. The electorate has every right to ask: \"Are we getting value for our money?\" Did anybody go to a polling station on 29 November last thinking what Ireland really needed was a raft of new junior and super junior Ministers? I do not think so. Parents who cannot get an assessment of need for their child certainly did not. Patients who cannot get a hospital appointment did not. Mothers and fathers raising children in emergency accommodation certainly did not. Communities impacted by crime and antisocial behaviour did not. We need more nurses, therapists, gardaí, teachers and SNAs, but the needs of ordinary people, it seems, are an afterthought. The Government instead drove on to fashion a brazen, grubby deal to grease the wheels of power. If the previous Government was formed on the back of a Micheál Martin U-turn regarding Fine Gael, this Government is formed on the back of a Micheál Martin U-turn regarding Deputy Michael Lowry.",
                "We know, following the Moriarty tribunal's findings of corruption, the Taoiseach's view of Deputy Lowry was that he was unfit to hold public office. Described as a rogue politician, demands were made by the Taoiseach for him to resign his seat, but today he is happy to have him as the kingmaker in the formation of this Government. The question for the Taoiseach that he has not answered is simply this: what changed? When did he stop considering Deputy Lowry to be a rogue politician? When did he go from viewing him as someone unfit to hold public office to viewing him as someone with whom he wishes to form a Government? The answer is clear: that changed when it suited the Taoiseach and when it suited his interests.",
                "This demonstrates that Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil will do anything to attain and hold on to power at all costs. They prioritise doling out sweeteners to Michael Lowry's group to satisfy the Regional Independents. They attempted to engineer a stroke to allow those TDs to be in government and in opposition at the same time, a move that would make a mockery of this Dáil and undermine the integrity of this House. However, we saw that off as a united Opposition, and thank goodness for that.",
                "This is a Government built on stroke politics as seen in its programme for Government. This is where things get interesting and where the lofty rhetoric really gets tested, because what is noteworthy is the lack of timelines, specifics and clarity, and the lack of ambition too. The lack of any new ideas is mind-blowing.",
                "The outgoing Government's greatest failure was in housing, a failure so profound and so deep that it affects every aspect of our society. However, rather than change direction, which a rational serious government would do, it seeks to dress up your failure as success. Throughout 2020, Micheál Martin, Simon Harris and Darragh O'Brien trumpeted the claim that 40,000 new houses would be built by the end of last year, and they repeated this during the election campaign. Today's CSO full-year report exposed their claim as bluff and spin, with housing completions for 2024 falling far short of that figure, missing even the original target. The fact is that fewer homes were built last year than the year before. Far from turning a corner, as the Taoiseach so frequently claims, they are going around in circles.",
                "The programme for Government guarantees that the Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael housing disaster will continue, that home ownership will remain beyond the reach of working people and that the need to ramp up the delivery of affordable housing and of council housing will remain unmet. It is not only in housing where their poverty of ambition leaps from the page. Where is the public model of childcare that Simon Harris talked a big game on? Not a whisper. Where is the delivery date for €200 a month childcare - the plan that we had and which you borrowed but are not going to deliver? Where is the specific commitment to abolish the means test for carers? There are just more vague pledges to improve the lives of carers but no specific actions. There is nothing in this document to convince us that the scandal of children with scoliosis and spina bifida being left to wait in agony for their operations will be brought to an end, which is shameful and a shame on you.",
                "Irish reunification represents the greatest opportunity for the progress, prosperity and future of our country. Any government worth its salt would actively plan and prepare for constitutional change, for the ending of partition and for a united Ireland. In its programme, the Government claims it is committed to the unity of the Irish people. It talks about a focus on investment, reconciliation and the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, which is all well and good. However, the document contains no meaningful commitments to achieving Irish unity. There is no plan for unity and no effort to reach out to those with a different view on unity. It dodges entirely the need for a citizens' assembly. The programme is completely silent on how this Government will prepare for Irish unity referendums as provided for in the Good Friday Agreement. Generational change is happening in Ireland. The day will come when people will have their say on unity, so treading water is not good enough. The Government needs to put Irish reunification at the very heart of its work for the future.",
                "For 15 months, the people of Ireland have protested in support of the people of Gaza and Palestine and have stood with them as they faced genocide. They have also repeatedly called on the Government to sanction Israel and to pass the occupied territories Bill as a matter of urgency. Now, despite previous assurances and posturing, Micheál Martin proposes to scrap the Bill-----"

They are entitled to see ambition to make their lives better. Another five years of mediocrity simply will not cut it. The priorities for Government must be to ensure that everybody can have a home of their own, to transform our health services, to deliver affordable childcare and to really tackle the cost of living. These things can and must be fixed but they will only be fixed by moving beyond the broken politics that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have followed for generations. I believe the day will come when we will have a new government for working people. That is why we will work harder than ever to represent people, to stand up for them, to fight their corner, to convince and to reassure more people that there is a better way."

If his threats come to pass, we could find ourselves in serious difficulties from a trade relationship point of view.

Does he not think women should have equal representation at Cabinet level?",

The Social Democrats have always been evidence based and solution focused in our efforts to make Ireland a more equal, sustainable and inclusive society. That will be our approach in this Dáil too. We will also robustly hold this Government to account. As members of Opposition, that is our job.",

Where is the urgency to tackle the challenges that we face in housing, disability, health and climate action? Where is the new energy that we heard so much about during the election campaign? It seems to have fizzled out. It is now three months since the Dáil sat regularly. The country faces huge challenges that need urgent action.",
                "While Government work has ground to a standstill, one unilateral action was taken last week which I want to highlight today. The Taoiseach endorsed the IHRA definition of antisemitism which has been routinely weaponised to smear critics of the State of Israel as antisemitic. We saw examples of this ourselves on the front page of the Sunday Independent earlier in the week. The outgoing Israeli ambassador, H.E. Ms Dana Erlich, accused Simon Harris of being antisemitic and claimed that President Michael D. Higgins is fostering incitement. In the article, it was clear that she was relying on the IHRA definition to make these scurrilous accusations and the Government, by endorsing this definition, has opened up the door to these kind of baseless attacks. Does the Taoiseach now regret his decision? Antisemitism is vile and must be opposed in all of its forms. Criticism of the State of Israel is not antisemitic and this country should not endorse a definition that has been used to silence critics of a genocide.",

In fact, you contradicted forecasts from the CSO, the ESRI and the Central Bank to spin this yarn, trying to massage home-delivery numbers in advance of an election. You have now been found out. There was a shortfall of almost 10,000 homes. Your dismal failure on housing is causing huge levels of anxiety and suffering. The Government is creating a society where only those on the highest of incomes can afford a home. It is dangerous and dystopian.",
                "Fewer homes were delivered last year than in 2023. That does not sound like a plan that is working. The Government's housing plan is taking the country backwards, not forwards. Median house prices last year increased on average by €40,000.",
                "Who can possibly afford these kinds of eye-watering price increases? We need a radical reset on housing.",
                "The recent election had an air of unreality about it. Far from being prudent fiscal stewards, Fianna Fáil and, in particular, Fine Gael threw around tax and spending promises like snuff at a wake. They and others pretended that one can ramp up spending while slashing taxes. What we did not hear from either Government party, not to mention the motley crew of Independents, was a coherent strategy for continued economic growth and stability. This is needed to facilitate the investment in infrastructure and public services that this country so badly needs. It is simply not credible to plan those investments while massively eroding the tax base. Nor was there any sense of a contingency plan should the global economy take a turn. Donald Trump's inauguration this week brings this risk into sharper focus given his plans to upend trade. His announcement that he will exit the OECD tax deal poses a particular threat. Ireland, as a small, open economy, will be heavily exposed. There are risks, not only to our windfall tax corporation receipts but also to jobs and incomes. We need an alternative economic strategy.",
                "Donald Trump is not the only threat on the horizon. In Europe right-wing and far-right populists are on the rise on a platform of nationalism and xenophobia. Ireland, as we know, is not immune to the far right and the spread of disinformation. There are those who seek to blame every problem on vulnerable minorities and those who seek to thrive on hate. All of us in this Dáil should stand against these malign actors. Ireland is a country that has always been welcoming. We do not punch down. It is, therefore, deeply concerning that the programme for Government includes proposals to restrict the movement of international protection applicants. This sounds like de facto detention. Seeking international protection is not a crime. The Government must urgently clarify this proposal.",
                "It is nearly two months since the people went to the polls on 29 November. The message they sent us was very clear. They want action on the many challenges this country faces, not inertia. The Social Democrats will work constructively with all parties in this Dáil to make this happen."

It is very vague and aspirational but it is then very specific when it comes to reforming the triple lock. It states the Government is going to \"progress\" the occupied territories Bill, not enact it as a matter of urgency but \"progress\" it, whereas it will reform the triple lock. It is extremely worrying to see what the Government \"will\" do as opposed to the other matters.",
                "I am also extremely concerned that the Taoiseach has adopted and included in the programme for Government the definition of antisemitism. It is leaving us wide open to charges of being antisemitic when I unreservedly condemn the actions of Israel. What Israel is doing is genocide. It is carrying out genocide. Then we have this definition the Government has adopted without discussing it with the Dáil.",
                "The Taoiseach did not refer to climate change. The Minister to his right is on record as saying the planet is burning. If the planet is burning, the programme for Government has got to reflect that. It does not reflect it at all.",

I congratulate the new Minister for Health and wish her the best. I come from a city where 61 people were waiting on trolleys yesterday with no hope of a bed."

Some 60% of the Ministers in this Government are from the greater Dublin area. That is not spatial development. The west is certainly not awake in this Government.",
                "It is incredible that the Cabinet is being named on the day the news broke that 30,000 homes were built in the State last year. Housing is the biggest issue affecting this country and the Government has been in reverse. When the new Taoiseach awoke this morning, on the day of his elevation, tens of thousands of people in this country awoke in homelessness. While the Taoiseach was in Áras an Uachtaráin, young families were in the airports, emigrating to escape the high price of rents and houses. Ministers had to wait for one day for their ministerial seals but there are hundreds of thousands of people in this country who are waiting for hospital and health treatment at the same time. It is interesting that so much of the Leinster House campus was festooned with gardaí when many of our citizens are dodging town centres because of the lack of gardaí in those areas.",
                "It is also important to say that many parents are lying awake every night trying to decide how they are going to make ends meet with the money they have. Yet, we have newly minted Ministers of State who are going to be counting €800 per day in salary for every day they work over the next while. One of the biggest problems I have with this Government is the fact that things are moving so slowly on so many different projects. It is interesting that 89 days will have passed from the last time there were consecutive sittings of the Dáil until the next time it next sits on consecutive days. There is a slow, bureaucratic culture at the heart of this Government. That is also to be seen in practically every infrastructural project that is happening at the moment and it has consequences. This Government has the urgency relating to the national children's hospital."

There has been no real change of Government. It was voted today that there would be another break of two weeks. TDs, it seems, get more holidays than junior infants.",

I was elected by parents who have not seen their children in years because they were forced to emigrate for a better future. I was elected by young couples who cannot afford to rent, buy or build in the communities in which they grew up. For them, I take this job seriously. I came here to work, to challenge this Government and hold it to account and to offer positive and proactive solutions over the years ahead. What is the first thing the Government has done? It has voted for further delay. Delays, it seems, are the order of the day in housing, infrastructure and healthcare. If delays were an Olympic sport, this Government would certainly bring home gold. The people of Mayo and, indeed, the entire country deserve better than excuses and inaction. They deserve a Government that shows up and shows the urgency the Tánaiste speaks of.",

This is happening year after year and time after time. We have a cost-of-living crisis. Ordinary farmers, because of an IT problem in the Department of agriculture, cannot get their payments. Now it is proposed that we take another two weeks off to do I do not know what. I would say the new Government was sorted and solved the day after the count in the general election. The parties knew exactly what way things were going. The numbers were added up and we knew where the jobs were going to go. Now, they want to take another two weeks out. It is shocking, to be quite honest. The public out there are furious about it. We can hear it in their voices, locally and nationally.

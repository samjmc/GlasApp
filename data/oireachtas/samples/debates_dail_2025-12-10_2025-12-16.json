Our thoughts are with those families, the injured, the wider Jewish community and, of course, with the people of Australia and Sydney. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a n-amnacha.",
                "Households hammered by relentless hikes in energy and electricity prices are in disbelief today. They have awoken to the news that their bills are set to increase even further. Electricity network charges are being hiked, forcing hard-pressed households to carry the can for upgrading the grid. Customers here, as the Taoiseach knows, are squeezed to breaking point just to light and heat their homes. They pay among the highest electricity prices in Europe. Hundreds of thousands of working households cannot pay their energy bills because of these non-stop hikes. Price-gouging energy companies are making bumper profits to the tune of millions of euro, if not billions.",
                "In the past couple of months, we have seen energy companies, one after the other, jack up their prices so that a million households now face higher bills this Christmas. They fleece people at every turn and the Government has not laid a glove on them. Worse than that, it has actually enabled this behaviour.",
                "At the same time, the Government cancelled energy credits in a budget of €9.4 billion, in which, astonishingly, it managed to leave working people worse off. It has also increased the price of petrol, diesel and home heating oil. Now people face another increase to their already unaffordable electricity bills.",
                "The upgrading and modernisation of our national grid is incredibly important. It has to be a priority. God knows real progress is badly needed after decades of terrible planning and chronic underinvestment by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. It simply beggars belief, however, that ordinary households will be hit with another increase to improve the grid while energy companies laugh all the way to the bank. Energy companies are making millions of euro, eye-watering profits. It is incredible, therefore, that struggling customers will be asked to fork out again.",
                "If the Government really cared about fairness, if the Taoiseach's Government cared at all, it would put the onus for funding this upgrade where it belongs: on the mega-rich energy companies and other large energy consumers. It would not go to ordinary people again. The Government should not be adding a single red cent to these rip-off bills, especially during such tough times. It should be about getting costs down, reducing electricity prices and making life affordable.",
                "Tá an Rialtas ag roghnú billí leictreachais daoine a mhéadú ag an am is measa, nuair atá teaghlaigh faoi bhrú uafásach cheana féin le billí ollmhóra le híoc acu. Ní féidir leis seo dul ar aghaidh. The Government's failure to tackle the energy rip-off leaves people in desperate situations. Not alone is the Government not doing anything to help working people; it also stands by as these bills will be increased again. Does the Taoiseach think this is a fair way to treat people already fleeced by non-stop electricity price hikes? What is his response to today's news? Will he intervene as Head of Government to put a stop to this increase?"

Before I begin to respond, I want to take a moment as well to express my sympathy to and solidarity with the Australian people and with our Jewish community here in Ireland as they come to terms with the horror and the grief of the mass shooting event at Bondi Beach on Sunday. Fifteen people, including a ten-year-old child and a Holocaust survivor, were cruelly murdered and more than 40 others injured for no other reason than their Jewish faith and identity as they gathered to celebrate Hanukkah. I am acutely conscious of the feelings of vulnerability and isolation that an event like this can cause among our own small Jewish community. I take this opportunity to send a very clear message from the Dáil, and as Head of Government, that our Jewish neighbours are an important and very valued part of our society and that there can be no place for antisemitism or antisemitic rhetoric in our State.",

It is a major decision by the Government. The Government has allocated €3.5 billion in equity to help to leverage and underpin the enormous investment that will occur from this. In many respects, this is a decisive moment in respect of the energy grid.",
                "I acknowledge fully and understand the pressure people are under in respect of energy bills. Part of this announcement is the work of the national energy affordability task force, which was established by the Minister and which has already published its first report. Its task is to identify measures that will reduce electricity prices in the short term and permanently. Some of its measures were delivered under budget 2026. These include the decision to extend the reduction in VAT on electricity from 13% to 9% and significant work on the fuel allowance.",
                "We included those on the working family payment. An extra 50,000 people will be paid the fuel allowance in March and that will be backdated to January. Of course, we increased the fuel allowance. An extra €140 will now be available for over 450,000 recipients between September and April. The €400 income tax disregard for households involved in energy microgeneration has been extended. There are also the budget measures more generally.",
                "Retrofitting has grown significantly over the past number of years and is making a real difference to many houses. A deep retrofit can save over €1,100. Approximately 228,000 upgrades have happened now in terms of homeowners. Some €1.5 billion has been allocated for that. This year alone, another 64,500 home energy upgrades will happen, in addition to 14,300 local authority upgrades. We are progressing significant change in energy consumption within our households, more generally.",
                "The affordability task force has to look at the more fundamental issue of the regulatory framework that governs energy prices in this country. That is a key objective of it, allied with European initiatives that will be required in terms of how energy is priced in the European market."

A so-called affordability task force has done absolutely bugger all to achieve affordability for those households and struggling families. We have a Government that is prepared to sit back and let households suffer. That is what I hear. Nobody is contesting the need for investment in the grid but the Government needs to accept the reality of what is happening in households right across the land as we approach Christmas. The reality is that working households, and let me emphasise that I am talking about working households, cannot meet their bills. Today, they wake to the news that in fact those bills will be increased again. I ask the Taoiseach not to offload this to some task force. What will he do to ensure that those bills can be met, that they are reduced and that families can have an affordable life again?"

In principle, what has been announced today is very welcome, and the engagement the Minister has had with us, particularly in the last two weeks, is also something different and very welcome. There always is a \"however\", and the \"however\" here is the detail. We will support the Minister on this decision. The reality is that we need close on 600 beds in the mid-west by 2040. However, the capital envelope for this is too small. It is €9.2 billion up to 2030. Our capacity as a country to deliver on this is not there. My question to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and the Minister for public expenditure, if he is going to be still there, is this: will the Government give the financial capacity to deliver on this plan? Without that financial capacity, this plan, with all the goodwill of the Minister and everyone else, cannot be delivered on. It is impossible. It just does not add up. Will changes be made to the capital plan of the HSE in order to deliver this for the mid-west and end the discrimination that has been happening to us?"

From that, there is no question that the mid-west needs additional investment but also reform. The reform dimension started two years or more ago now and has had impact, but the investment also has had impact. The level of increase in investment over the last five years in the mid-west is quite substantial, which gives prospects for significant investment in the next five years and even beyond that. Investment in the hospitals in the region went from about €370 million to €689 million. The UHL budget has gone from €265 million to €507 million, and then on the current side there are additional doctors, nurses, allied healthcare professionals and so forth. In that period, about 420 additional beds will be delivered across the mid-west region, including 48 additional beds. The Deputy has the details of that in Ennis, St. John's and so on, and for Nenagh.",

Enabling works are under way, as the Deputy knows, for a second 96-bed block at UHL. The Minister is mandating the HSE to acquire a site as close as possible to the existing site. In terms of option C, which is model 3 reconfiguration across the mid-west, the Government has agreed to develop a model 3 hospital in the HSE mid-west that will provide a second emergency department for the region.

At that point, it will be necessary to incrementally build up and then free up and decant services from the main hospital site. Equally, there is no reason, given population growth and everything else, why we should not be incrementally reconfiguring and moving to a model 3 in the wider mid-west region.

Investment in services is conflated with a recognition of the cost of having a disability. The Government ignored its own reports on the huge additional cost of having a disability and took the decision to cut people's income, removing one-off payments without replacing them with anything permanent. Many people are full of dread about the future because they literally do not know how they will keep food on the table.

Ireland has been stabbed in the back by those who call themselves our European partners. The outcome of the EU Fisheries Council negotiations for 2026 quotas represents a black day for Ireland. It is a day that will never be forgotten by our fisherman. For decades, Ireland has played by the rules. Since 1973, we have opened our rich waters to Europe under the Common Fisheries Policy. We gave access and we sacrificed. In return, we were promised a measure of fairness, a safeguard called the Hague preferences. That was our crumb of comfort when cuts were imposed. Last Friday, that safeguard was ripped away. It was blocked deliberately by the Netherlands, backed by France, Germany and, shamefully, Poland, which had pledged support but which turned its back when it mattered. The Netherlands, with its factory ships and super-trawlers, already dominates our waters. It control fleets across Europe. It has now ensured its dominance will continue, while Irish fishermen are left to rot. The countries involved have declared war on the Irish fishing fleet.",
                "Let us talk facts. Belgian beam trawlers will haul 400 tonnes of black sole from Irish waters in 2026. Irish fishermen will catch just 28 tonnes in our own waters. We are staring down the barrel of a loss of over €100 million in quota value, a hit of more than €200 million to wider seafood sector and more than 2,500 jobs gone from communities that have already been gutted by years of EU mismanagement and Government indifference.",
                "Let us not forget that this is not the first time. We were sold out during the Brexit negotiations. A deal struck at Christmas that year gutted our industry, and now we are here again. We depended on Barnier that time and he stuck us on the double. Now, it is another Christmas, another blow, another betrayal. The amount of fish we will be allowed to catch in 2026 in the waters off our coast will be less than 9%, while others have increased their shares to 91% as a result of this action. Where is relative stability now? Those involved blocked the Hague preferences and secured their own access. They did all of that under the banner of European solidarity. Solidarity - I hate to say it - my arse; this is piracy dressed up as policy. I say this plainly. Ireland has been betrayed. The Common Fisheries Policy is corrupt. It is designed to serve the interests of the big players, such as the Netherlands, France and Germany, while crushing small costal nations like ourselves.",

                "In terms of the overall issue, it was on scientific advice that the Council based its decisions. The Deputy is familiar with the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, ICES, report, in which the scientific advice was, in essence, for a reduction of 70% in the total allowable catch for mackerel - that is existential for the pelagic fleet - a 41% reduction in respect of blue whiting and a 22% reduction in respect of boarfish. These are devastating losses for our fishing community, with consequential issues for seafood sector, for processing downstream and for coastal communities that are dependent on jobs arising from that.",
                "The issue of unsustainable fishing of key pelagic stock such as mackerel by certain coastal states outside the European Union has been raised by Ireland repeatedly. We have, through the AGRIFISH Council, called for urgent European action to save the north-east Atlantic pelagic stocks. Again, Europe needs to negotiate far more strongly in terms of sending a clear message that actions that threaten the sustainability of our shared stocks are not acceptable to the European Union. There needs to be a concerted response. The Minister of State, Deputy Dooley, travelled to all the capitals and worked extremely hard. The Minister, Deputy Heydon, was there with the Minister of State at the time. I met with all the major fishing organisations last week or the week before last.",
                "What we have to do now is develop our approach. Today, the Government took a decision to establish a task force with the industry to come back to us in the first quarter of next year in terms of how we, nationally, can support our fishers and create a sustainable pathway over the next number of years. We intend to re-engage regarding our limitations under existing state aid rules. Given the existential nature of this hit to the Irish fishing industry, we will have to respond in a strong way in terms of financially supporting our fishers over the next number of years. Approximately €102 million is involved, and that does not take account, as the Deputy said, of the impacts on the value chain in the seafood sector for fish processes and ancillary services. That is also an issue of significant concern. The Hague preferences would have accounted for somewhere between €13 million and €18 million of that €102 million, so it is a much bigger issue, notwithstanding the unacceptable nature of the decision of other member states not to facilitate the granting of the Hague preferences. We will work now with the industry with a view to designing a package and a framework to create a sustainable future for Irish fishing."

I met many trawler owners in Castletownbere on Sunday. They tell me that 30 articulated lorries come into Castletownbere every week and leave it with Irish fish out of Belgian, Spanish, French, UK and German trawlers. They are robbing our Irish fish in our Irish water and taking it into their countries while we stand idly by and accept this. I am not asking for another committee or report. Will the Government take this fight to the highest court possible? Will it challenge this corrupt decision by legal means or will it stand by while Dutch super-trawlers plunder our waters and Irish coastal communities are wiped off the map? Let us have no more excuses. Will the Government fight or will it surrender?"

Last year, the then Minister for Education and Youth, Deputy McEntee, successfully spearheaded a campaign to open more ASD classes at primary school level. We need the same level of urgency at post-primary level. We know that a significant number of children with ASD will move from primary to post-primary in coming years. Their parents are already worried about the availability of suitable places. They want their children with ASD educated, with their siblings and peers, in their local schools and communities. These families deserve assurances that their children will not be left without appropriate educational facilities. Schools and parents in towns such as Abbeyleix, Mountmellick, Mountrath, Portarlington and Portlaoise need to know what engagement is happening and what planning is under way to secure places for September 2026.",

Approximately two years ago, on foot of a commitment of €9.5 million from the Department of justice's IIP programme, complemented by local fundraising, Sensational Kids commenced construction of a national child development centre on a site it had bought in Kildare town. A year ago, having drawn down half of the IIP money, the Department of justice ceased the flow of funds, and the builder departed the site while still owed over €600,000. Today, a year later, the site stands idle with no commitment forthcoming for the release of the balance of the IIP funding or for any additional capital funding from the HSE or any other State source. I have a simple question. Will the Taoiseach refer this crisis situation for consideration to the disability unit established by him, in his Department, in order to find a resolution to this critical matter?"

How can it be that for our State and our waters, which have suffered so much, the Hague preferences - in place since 1976 and the final veneer of fairness in the Common Fisheries Policy for Ireland - can just be stripped away? I am asking the Taoiseach if he will take legal action.

How is that we have a situation where we have a Minister from Dublin and high visibility in Dublin? If you walk out of here, you will see them all over the place, which is great. However, you will not find them in Roscrea. Why is there high visibility of gardaí across Dublin this Christmas but there is not in Roscrea? Why is rural Ireland being discriminated against compared to Dublin when it comes to high visibility policing?"

It is a harrowing report which concluded that the organisation had failed to act against the perpetrator for years, despite, \"a significant degree of organisational awareness of the risk that he posed to children\". One of the central recommendations of that report was that the national safeguarding officer be independent, specifically to counter what was described as a cultural deference within St. John Ambulance. However, departmental funding for that role has now been ended and the same officer is being retained directly by the organisation itself, which at the very least raises a question mark over the independence of the role. I understand that survivors have been attempting to engage with, and discuss this with, the Minister for children but there has been no engagement whatsoever. In replies to parliamentary questions, the Minister details engagement with boards, with audits and with governance structures but does not seem to be engaging with the survivors. I ask the Taoiseach to discuss this with the Minister to ensure she engages and meets with the survivors."

The committee works to ensure a cross-Government approach to the implementation of our commitments regarding housing policy. This week’s meeting was specifically focused on our homelessness challenge, in particular the national housing plan commitments in this regard, including the development of a homeless prevention framework and a child and family homelessness action plan.",
                    "We are making good progress on the delivery of homes to those most in need across the country, with the new housing plan committed to delivering 72,000 social homes over its lifetime. However, as we increase supply, we also recognise that those experiencing, or at risk of, homelessness have a wide and complex variety of needs. We need to ensure that the appropriate services and policies are in place to support them. Housing is our single biggest issue as a country, with profound social and economic consequences. That is why it is at the centre of the Government’s focus.",
                    "Along with the largest ever commitment on social housing, the new national housing plan commits to delivering 300,000 new homes, including 90,000 affordable supports to help people who are struggling to have a home of their own. The plan sets out the highest ever commitment of State funding for housing, with €28 billion over the next five years, coupled with additional funding through State vehicles, including the Land Development Agency, the Housing Finance Agency, Home Building Finance Ireland, the First Home Scheme and the Irish Strategic Investment Fund. Housing delivery, along with infrastructure and utility investment to enable delivery at scale, is at the core of the agreed national development plan published in July, and, at €275 billion, the largest ever capital injection in the history of the State.",
                    "To build homes at the scale now required, we need improved and more resilient water, energy and transport services. We will see large-scale investment in all of these areas over the coming years. Last month under price review 6, the investment plan for energy infrastructure was finalised, including funding allocations of up to €18 billion to ESB and EirGrid, leveraged by the Government injection of €3.5 billion in equity to these companies. This will enable thousands more homes to be connected to the grid.",
                    "We have also published the investment plan for water, which sets out over €12 billion investment in our water infrastructure, the majority of which will support the delivery of our housing targets. In addition, we are tackling barriers to delivery, through the accelerating infrastructure report and action plan, which includes reforms which will support public and private sector delivery of homes at scale.",
                    "Housing is at the centre of the State’s investment and focus for the coming years. However, to meet our targets, we will also need significant delivery from the private sector and we have implemented a number of measures and reforms in support of this. We have focused on making apartment delivery more financially viable, reformed our planning process and created a stable policy environment to enable the private sector to deliver at scale.",
                    "We are seeing indications now that our measures are beginning to take effect, evidenced by CSO data showing that we have had an increase of almost 30% in homes approved for planning in quarter 3 of this year, in comparison with the same time period last year, with the number of apartments approved up by over 50%. These are clear indications of confidence. Work is under way to zone a significantly higher quantum of land across the country. Now is the time for ambitious execution, and we have set out a clear framework and roadmap for the coming years to do this. I am confident that we can build on our success to date and bring about a very significant scale-up in our delivery of housing over the lifetime of this Government."

In my constituency, which the Taoiseach visited, we see it as one of the fastest-growing constituencies in the country, with large developments like Adamstown and Clonburris flying ahead. In its county development plans, South Dublin County Council is setting very ambitious targets for zoning. The key to enabling this zoning and to enabling delivery of those homes is the deployment and development of DART+ South West as a transport programme, to intensify the capacity on that line, not only benefitting commuters in Dublin Mid-West but also Kildare North, Dublin South-Central and Dublin-Central.",

By the end of the Christmas recess, it will be nearly a year since we heard that announcement. One-off houses in rural Ireland can benefit if we allow log cabins and modular homes to be built not just in backyard developments. They are also one of the few affordable houses out there for young people in rural Ireland whom I speak to. I could give numerous examples of log cabins and modular homes across north Tipperary and north-west Kilkenny that are at threat of enforcement proceedings because they do not have planning permission. Enforcement should not be ongoing until we know what these regulations say. In addition, the development contributions for one-off rural houses should be scrapped again. They are simply a privilege for building on your own land. First, will we see these planning regulations that will exempt log cabins? Second, will this go beyond backyard developments and allow them in rural areas? Third, when will we see the regulations?"

Likewise, Castlemartyr and Midleton have many prime-location properties left like deserted husks where boutiques could be flourishing or community hubs or accommodation created. In Holland or Germany this would not be tolerated. Landlords would have to sell up or repurpose a vacant property within a reasonable period or face losing it. The Government's softly-softly approach to vacancy and dereliction is clearly not working, and our towns and villages are haunted by this policy failure. We need to see swift direct action by our local authorities with landlords who blight our streets with decaying properties and a much more urgent pursuit of derelict site levies. The collection of derelict site levies by Revenue is welcome, but why is the Government waiting until 2027 to implement this?"

Some 69% of people aged 25 years or under are living with their parents. Well over 40% of adults who are under 30 are living with their parents. That is changing the very nature of Irish society. The ability for adults to form relationships to have children is being deleted for hundreds of thousands of people. This is having massive ramifications.

The Deputy is right in saying that we need to make sure that the local authorities prioritise this - in other words, that they put a project manager or whatever in charge of this operation in the towns and the cities to make this a reality. It needs to be driven with someone who is accountable and who is doing this every single day, in my view. I will talk to the Minister about that.",

A new boxing club is being built in the housing development. That is the way to go. Is the local authority involved in the specific development to which the Deputy referred? It is. The local authority should look seriously at that example. Amenities matter in communities and society. They give young people opportunities. It seems to me that some accommodation must be made for Santry Boxing Club. The other example was a good initiative. The name of the boxing club escapes me now, but the people will have a first-class boxing club as a result of the development. It might be a bigger development. In fairness to the LDA, it saw that needed to be done. The Deputy might give me the details.",

It becomes fairly obvious in a league table scenario which councils are not performing. The actions can take a number of forms. We have to work through the actions. There could be disincentives or limited finance. We have to work through that, but there must be consequences or direct action from the State to override councils that are not performing in respect of housing more generally.",

We discovered recently with the tenant in situ scheme that houses were being bought with people living in them. Those houses are bought by councils and suddenly there is €80,000 or €100,000 going into the house. The original objective of that was to stop people going into homelessness. When a local authority house becomes vacant, unless there is something majorly wrong structurally, it should be occupied within a month. We have given huge money to local authorities for voids over the past five years. They should get on with it. They let the houses lie idle for too long. It is inexcusable. In some councils, there is inertia. I have seen it. People leave very good houses for one reason or another, the shutters go up and the houses are left there for three or four months. Those houses should be reoccupied once the electrics and everything else are grand. If we have to get around to repairing them, we can at least give someone the house. That is my view. I get impatient about it from time to time, to be honest. I hear what the Deputy is saying. If you give an upfront grant, there is no guarantee it will be spent on voids, and that is the problem.",

There is a high rate for singles in homelessness as well as children. There are different elements to the issue. An increasing amount of those who leave direct provision end up homeless. Family reunification comes with that. The link between migration and housing has grown, but is not the only factor. Family separation is a factor. Different factors give rise to homelessness, and specifically child homelessness. The Minister has specific measures.

There is a league table showing which local authorities did what in respect of derelict sites. It is very telling. There are two or three that did an exceptional job. If they can do it, why cannot others? It begs the question of whether there is, or has been historically, inertia in local authorities about the Derelict Sites Act. Revenue will now be charged with it. That will bring about a change and better behaviour. The reason for the length of time, and I hope it can be accelerated, is the mapping. I have challenged officials from the Department of Finance and Revenue about this issue. I have asked why the maps are not there already and why they would take so long. Apparently, at the time of the land tax and others, the mapping was not as comprehensive as people would have expected.",

Every young person in the country has a right to aspire to owning a home, and many do aspire to owning a home, or some young families being able to rent a home at an affordable cost. We are building substantially more houses than we did five years ago. We are doing about 30,000 odd now compared to 20,000 in 2020. We need to go to 50,000 and we need all hands on deck in that respect. I do not think enrolments are going down in schools yet, I think they are going up."

Coming a decade after the Paris Agreement and during a period of enhanced geopolitical turbulence, my attendance at the summit was an important opportunity to show Ireland’s continuing commitment to the objectives of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement to limit emissions in order to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. I delivered Ireland’s national statement on 6 November, highlighting the reality that climate change is no longer a distant threat and pointing to the remarkable litany of record-breaking climate events in the 12 months since COP29 in Azerbaijan, including Storm Éowyn which brought the strongest wind gusts ever recorded in Ireland and the highest storm surges on the western seaboard. We saw the damage that Storm Bram caused last week to counties all over the country.

The second thematic session took the form of a panel discussion on \"Energy transition and ten years of the Paris Agreement: NDCs and financing\". I expressed Ireland’s commitment to ensuring a just and inclusive energy transition pathway for all nations. I also shared Ireland’s focus on accelerating the delivery of renewable generation. I also participated in a small round table hosted by President Lula da Silva and attended also by the United Nations Secretary General, António Guterres, on climate adaptation and resilience.

The problem for those travelling along the M11 into the capital, unlike a number of other commuter routes, is that we do not have a realistic rail alternative. We have fewer services, worse rolling stock and more overcrowding than any other rail service. What particularly annoys me is the fact that yesterday, the rail project prioritisation strategy made no commitments whatsoever about improvements for the Rosslare rail line and further looked at abandoning the proposals to develop and reopen the Rosslare to Waterford rail line. If we are to provide a real alternative and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and car use, there has to be a real public transport alternative. I want assurances that the Department of Transport has not abandoned the rail commuters along the Rosslare rail line."

The prioritisation of DART+ South West was not announced. There is significant traffic and build-up on the N7, M7, N4 and M4, particularly the N7 coming from Naas, Sallins and Celbridge.

In east Cork, we have had no ranger for approximately 12 of the last 15 years. There has been no district conservation officer for 18 months and no regional manager in place for years over east Cork and Waterford. It is difficult to give precise figures for these vacancies, because the Department has been incredibly opaque in response to questions I have submitted on recruitment to the NPWS. In one response, the Minister referred to \"perceived vacancies\", as if we were all imagining those roles being vacant. Also, bizarrely, the Department will not give details of staffing by geographical area for \"operational security reasons\". This is akin to An Garda Síochána not sharing numbers of gardaí employed in a given division. The Department also will not give any information on recruitment campaigns being undertaken. Meanwhile, hedgerows and trees are being trashed with impunity and the whole idea of habitat protection looks more like a bad joke in this country. When are we going to see more transparency from the Department of heritage on staffing of the NPWS? When are we going to see those crucial roles in east Cork and Waterford filled?"

                "I move: \"That the Bill be now read a second time.\"",
                "I am pleased to introduce the Appropriation Bill. The Bill is an important annual financial legislative instrument which must be enacted before the end of the year in order to give effect to the authorisation of voted expenditure through 2025 and to allow for the continuation of expenditure into 2026.",
                "The Bill has two primary functions. The first is to provide legal authorisation for all the expenditure that occurred in 2025 on the basis of the Estimates voted on by the Dáil over the year. These allocations are known as the amounts to be appropriated for the supply of services. They are set out in section 2 and Schedule 1. They relate to the Revised Estimates, Further Revised Estimates and Supplementary Estimates that have been agreed by the Dáil over the course of 2025. In net terms, these Estimates amount to €91.5 billion. In gross terms and taking into account expenditure on the Social Insurance Fund and National Training Fund, total gross voted expenditure allocated for this year is €109.9 billion. This reflects the Government's investment in public services, delivering on the priorities we set out in budget 2025, including higher weekly social protection payments, targeted investments in areas such as health and transformational investment in infrastructure to unlock growth, enhance competitiveness and support communities all over the country under the revised national development plan.",
                "Our social protection system seeks to provide an effective social safety net for the more vulnerable members of our society. When expenditure on the Social Insurance Fund is included, the 2025 gross expenditure allocation for social protection is over €27.5 billion.",
                "Funding provided in 2025 enabled improvements to the social welfare system for people on a range of income supports as well as providing additional support for families and people on illness, disability and carer programmes. Funding in 2025 delivered increases in core weekly social welfare rates, which increased the income of an estimated 1.45 million recipients, increases to the child support payment and working family payment income thresholds, an increase in the domiciliary care allowance rate, and a range of other measures.",
                "Significant investment in the health service, with the allocation for health in 2025 reaching €26.1 billion, continues a trend of substantial resourcing in recent years. It underscores the Government’s commitment to ensuring that the healthcare needs of our population can continue to be met in a complex and challenging environment. Ireland achieves good health outcomes across a number of indicators. Over the past decade, Ireland has achieved an improvement in life expectancy. Improvements in the overall health of the population have resulted in significant declines in our mortality rates for many of the common causes of death over the past decade. There have been significant expansions in eligibility for schemes including the free contraception scheme. There have also been women’s health initiatives and the abolition of inpatient charges for public patients.",
                "Housing has seen a strong ramp-up in delivery on both the social and affordable programmes. In 2024, 10,500 new social homes were delivered and there is a continued delivery pipeline for 2025 and future years. A total of €9.7 billion in funding is being provided this year for the housing, local government and heritage Vote group. This includes close to €6 billion in capital funding. The significant level of capital investment will continue under the revised national development plan, with almost €40 billion committed over the period to 2030 to support housing delivery and water infrastructure.",
                "Education funding in 2025 provided an appropriate school place to over 975,000 students in primary, post-primary and special schools around the country. This is alongside a record number of teachers, with approximately 78,000 employed by the Department of Education and Youth. Close to 700 new teachers were employed in September 2025 for the commencement of the 2025-26 school year. To support the education of students with special education needs, over 400 new special classes were sanctioned for this school year, bringing the total number of special classes to over 3,700. Education capital expenditure in 2025 is supporting the continued progression of around 300 building projects currently at construction.",
                "The 2025 funding has also enabled a range of other schemes and initiatives across government. In further and higher education, 2025 funding continues to invest for our future and to meet the skills needs of the labour market. Investment in 2025 provided funding for the increased delivery of apprenticeships, supporting skills development in key areas for the economy such as housing and climate action.",
                "At €1.35 billion, investment in early learning and childcare reached record levels in 2025. National childcare scheme universal subsidies are worth up to €5,000 per child in 2025. In addition, the access and inclusion model is now supporting more than 8,000 children with a disability to access childcare. Budget 2026 will continue to see early learning and school-age care prioritised, with an increase in the allocation of 10%. This will support affordability measures including further reductions in the maximum level of fees and increases to the income-assessed thresholds on the NCS. Increased capital funding through the NDP will seek to improve accessibility in the sector.",
                "A balanced approach to public service pay in the context of both the State's fiscal position and the broader economic environment was achieved by the Public Service Agreement 2024-2026. Multiyear public service agreements have contributed to stability within our economy by facilitating the delivery of quality public services, ongoing reforms and the maintenance of industrial peace in the public service.",
                "The second principal function of the Bill is to provide a legal basis for expenditure to continue into next year in the period before the Dáil votes on the 2026 Estimates. As set out in the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act 1965, the authority for spending in 2026, prior to the agreement of the 2026 Estimates by the Dáil, is based on the amounts included in this Bill. For this reason, it is essential that it be enacted before the end of 2025. Should the Bill not be enacted, there would be no authority to spend any voted moneys in 2026 from the start of January until the approval of the 2026 Estimates.",
                "To account for the complexity faced by Departments in planning for major capital projects, the rolling multi-annual capital envelopes introduced in 2004 allow for the carryover of up to 10% of unspent voted capital expenditure from the current year into the next year. This provides the degree of flexibility needed for the year-on-year planning of capital expenditure. Schedule 2 of the Bill sets out the proposed capital expenditure amounts that are to be carried over to 2026 by Vote. The total level of capital carryover sought from 2025 into 2026 is €182.25 million. The carryover figure is on a downward trajectory from the amounts requested by Departments in recent years. I am pleased that the strong performance of capital expenditure this year reflects significant improvements in capital project delivery throughout the country. This continued investment is providing housing, school buildings and transport infrastructure for all our citizens, building capacity for our future. The Revised Estimates Volume 2026, which will be published by my Department in December, will include details of the amounts to be deferred by subhead for Votes that are availing of the capital carryover function for next year.",
                "As in previous years, the Appropriation Bill also provides a provision for repayable advances from the Central Fund to the Paymaster General’s supply account to meet certain 2026 Exchequer liabilities due for payment over the first week of January, such as payroll and pension payments. The provision for these advances is critical as the banking system will be closed on Thursday, 1 January. This means that it is necessary for the funding to be in place in departmental bank accounts before the end of this year to meet those liabilities on a timely basis.",
                "This Bill also provides provision to prefund certain payments under the Social Welfare Acts due between 1 January and 6 January 2026 that are made on an agency basis by An Post. The advances provision in the Bill ensures that these payments can be transferred from the Department of Social Protection to the network of An Post offices throughout the country. Section 3 provides for up to €1.2 billion to be advanced from the Central Fund to meet these requirements. This is a higher amount than in recent years due to payroll dates in early 2026. This is a technical provision and any advances will be repaid to the Central Fund in January 2026.",
                "The Bill is an essential element of housekeeping undertaken by the Dáil each year. The passage of this Bill will authorise in law all of the expenditure that has taken place in 2025 on the basis of the Estimates voted on by the Dáil over the course of this year. It also provides authority for voted expenditure to continue in the period between the beginning of January 2026 and when the Dáil approves the 2026 Estimates. This will ensure the continued funding for the delivery of front-line public services, including our health and education services, social protection payments, funding for An Garda Síochána and much more. It reflects a continuation of our planned approach to public spending, which is focused on delivering our economic, social, and climate ambitions and supporting a growing population now and into the future."

Ar ndóigh, tuigim gur Bille fíorthábhachtach é seo chun a chinntiú gur féidir le Ranna Rialtais airgead a chaitheamh ag tús Mhí Eanáir agus nach mbeidh vótaí ag teastáil chun é sin a dhéanamh. Mar gheall air sin, tuigimid an tábhacht a bhaineann leis. Tá bunús bunreachtúil leis an mBille seo agus, mar sin, beimid i Sinn Féin ag tacú leis.",
                "I understand there is a constitutional requirement for this Bill as it legislates for the financial resolutions, which include all of the Estimates agreed by the Dáil this year. The sums granted from the Central Fund under the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act 1965 will go towards making good the supply grant and amount, in the aggregate, to the sum of €91 billion. The key to this Bill is that it is a constitutional requirement and is essential to ensure Departments can spend money come January. We will therefore support the Bill.",
                "The Bill also allows for the four-fifths rule provided for under the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act. This means Departments can spend four fifths of what was allowed under the previous Appropriation Act without the need for a vote. If the Bill was not enacted, these Departments could not spend.",
                "The Bill also allows for capital carryover. As per the Finance Act 2004, each Department can carry over 10% of its capital allocation to next year. The deferred surrender relating to capital supply services this year totals €182 million.",
                "The spending of these funds will be key to tackling the big issues of the day. For many years, there was no debate on these Bills. It is welcome and important that we are now debating this particular Bill because there is a very serious aspect to it. Over the years, when we have discussed these Bills, one of the issues I have always raised is the matter of our infrastructural deficit and the fact that, for years, we have had the IMF, OECD and others telling us we had such a deficit. One of the issues I have always raised is that, when we look at capital expenditure, we must attempt to alleviate that infrastructural deficit. As I said to the Minister during oral questions last week, I really do wish him the best in that regard because this State and the people living within it and within our communities can no longer deal with the lack of infrastructure they are facing.",
                "I will start, when we are talking about that, with housing. Mar is eol don Aire, rud atá ráite agus luaite agam go minic leis ná go bhfuil fadhb againn nuair nach bhfuil an buninfreastruchtúr i gceantar agus mar gheall air sin nach bhfuil na suíomhanna leis na seirbhísí ann chun tithe a thógáil. Má bhreathnaímid ar Chonamara mar shampla, tá a fhios againn i ndeisceart Chonamara nach bhfuil an talamh ná na suíomhanna ag an gcomhairle contae chun a chinntiú go bhfuil sí in ann tithe a thógáil ar na suíomhanna sin mar gheall nach bhfuil na bunseirbhísí ann. Tá impleachtaí aige sin ar chuile shórt, ach go háirithe orthu siúd ar fad atá ag iarraidh bheith in ann cónaí sa cheantar arb as dóibh, rud nach féidir leo a dhéanamh faoi láthair mar gheall nach féidir teach a thógáil, a cheannach nó a fháil ar cíos i gConamara. Mar gheall air sin, tá tábhacht ag baint leis an mBille seo agus go n-úsáidfear an t-airgead sin chun an infheistiú sin a dhéanamh.",
                "When talking about housing, as I mentioned relating to Conamara but also Galway city, we have had the issue of lack of wastewater infrastructure on the east side of Galway city where I live, and the impact that has had on Ardán. That is why Bills like these are quite important because they have a direct impact. We need to see all that, what I would call basic, fundamental infrastructure, be developed to ensure that housing can be built on the east side of Galway city. Too many people who are born and raised in Galway city can no longer live in it because of the lack of housing. Then, we can look at the likes of the other basic infrastructure I have raised over the years when we were discussing this and talking about the importance of us having a full infrastructure plan. I understand the Minister is working on that and is hoping to progress it. I wish him well on that but because we have had decades of neglect in this region, there are serious implications. For example, extra services out of Oranmore train station are extremely welcome. The passing loop is extremely welcome but the fact that at the same time additional parking spaces have not been created, or they will not be prepared in time for the passing loop, means there is then an issue whereby if we do not have the infrastructure there, as sometimes one hand is not talking to the other, resulting in additional pressures. We already know the impact there. Oranmore train station is always packed out with cars. We then have additional stops that are crucially needed to ensure better public transport in Galway city. I refer to the likes of having an additional stop at Roscam to serve the people in the east side of Galway city, from Doughiska to Roscam, who could just dander down to a place like that if it was there. Park and ride has been talked about for years but again there has been an issue with the development of sites. When we have historically not looked at putting the investment into our basic infrastructure, these are the real-life impacts that has.",
                "Tuigeann an tAire go maith na deacrachtaí atá ann leis na bóithre, i gConamara ach go háirithe, agus an easpa infheistíochta a rinneadh iontu le fada an lá. Anois, tá fadhb againn nach mbíonn an t-airgead ar fáil don chomhairle contae chun déileáil leo seo. Tuigim an tábhacht a bhaineann leis an mBille ionas go mbeidh na Ranna éagsúla in ann airgead a chaitheamh i mí Eanáir ach caithfimid breathnú ar an mbealach ina bhfuil airgead á chaitheamh agus cinntiú go bhfuil an t-airgead ann dá leithéidí sin freisin. I will leave it at that as I am sharing time with my colleagues."

                "Constitutionally required, a key provision of this Bill relates to capital carryovers. This allows Departments to carry over allocated but unspent capital funding this year. That is straightforward enough. However, a cause of frustration is equally straightforward and that is the question of why. We immediately know that these funds are going unspent because one of the Minister's ministerial colleagues managed to deliver to some works early or under budget. It was the Minister for Finance who oversaw the signing of a contract for the national children's hospital. There have been 16 missed completion deadlines and it is running to around three times the initial estimated cost.",
                "While the Government today looks at the capital carryover, the country remains awash with underfunded infrastructure projects in desperate need of Government support. Nowhere is this more so than in the case of the north-west and Border regions. In my own constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, there are a number of such projects with the potential to have a profound impact on communities. Two are the N2 to Clontibret to the Border and the N2 Ardee to Castleblayney road projects. I reiterate my welcoming of the shared island funding for works on the A5 in the North, which complements both of these projects. However, the overall benefits accrued can only maximised if works being completed on this side of the Border are actually carried out. The N2 upgrades have potential to play a crucial part in the unlocking of the economic potential of the region. However, these projects have not seen the prioritisation needed from the Government. Works were effectively suspended under the previous Government due to a lack of funding. While the Minister can dispute that if he wishes, \"suspended\" is the language used by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, yet, its project appraisal balance sheet for this project scored these works the highest possible score for the impact they would have on safety. Following the tragic events of the last weekend, where four people were killed in separate collisions over a 24-hour period, the number of people killed on our roads in this State this year to date is 179, a figure which has surpassed that of last year. This is a crisis level of collisions. I support the Government target of reducing road fatalities to zero by 2050 but we need increased funding for education and communication in the Road Safety Authority and the Garda roads policing resources. We also need capital investment to progress projects that will have an impact on safety, and the funding of these projects in Monaghan can play a part in that in our region.",
                "Another area where our Government woefully failed to manage a budget is in relation to carbon tax allocations. In that case, we are not even talking about carryover. Having promised farmers that they would receive €1.5 billion from carbon tax by 2030, in addition to the CAP, halfway through 2030 what has materialised? Not half, not even 10%, just €110 million of the promised €1.15 billion. Of that €110 million, what was the Government's track record? More than half went unspent and was returned to the Exchequer, with just €4 million carried over in the manner we are dealing with today.",
                "In January, the Government will increase the cost of petrol and diesel through a hiked carbon tax. The Minister cannot tax people into using public transport options that are not reliable and are simply not there; they do not exist. He cannot credibly continue to mislead farmers promising billions of euro while delivering a meagre fraction. Real vision from the Government is needed. A vision for decarbonisation, economic development in the Border region and north west and increased use of public transportation will not be delivered through carbon tax. What the people of Monaghan and Cavan need is infrastructure and services, not hectoring or lectures and certainly not capital surrenders while the Government fails to fund the infrastructure our communities need. I ask the Government to consider its carbon tax increases, penalisation of the farmers and an abysmal track record of infrastructure in the Border region."

                "Questions need to be asked every single year in regard to how we fund our public services. One of those questions relates to the Defence Forces because the State has to set aside a certain amount to meet the established membership figure the forces are supposed to achieve. That number used to be 12,500 and was then reduced to 9,500. Every year, the money is set aside in the hope, or perhaps the dream, that we will reach that magical number. At the moment, we are 2,000 short of the magical number of 9,500. There are not enough people in any of the sections of the Defence Forces, whether an Cabhlach, the military or the Air Corps. They cannot provide services as an aid to the State at the rate we would like them to be able to do. That is no criticism of the men and women of the Defence Forces. It is just a fact of life and everything has to be tweaked accordingly.",
                "The men and women of the Defence Forces are under huge pressure to ensure they deliver extra overtime even though they do not get paid for any such overtime they do to fill in on the jobs that are meant to be done. We know this from some of the headlines during the year and it seems we will face the same situation next year because of the lack of equipment and, in particular, the lack of personnel. There was a lot of talk in the media in recent weeks about the additional costs and additional security required for the meetings that will be held in Ireland during our Presidency of the EU in the second half of next year. I am assured by the members of the Defence Forces to whom I have spoken that they will do what is required to ensure there is not any disruption to what is planned. However, unless we get real, that will take its toll on the Defence Forces. Even the recent announcement about capital spend on material does not address some of the shortfalls, including the continuous loss of personnel to the private sector or to other types of jobs.",
                "We must take seriously the need to increase the Defence Forces numbers, increase the equipment they have and identify the threats faced by the State, of which there have been a number over the years. The Defence Forces have not been provided with the equipment that could be used for defence purposes and as an aid to the civil power. Recently, the headlines have focused on the issue of drones. Anyone looking at the world in the past ten years will understand that drone technology is where it is, yet the Defence Forces have not caught up because they have not been given the funding to do so. The same is true of the Naval Service and the job of work it must do to defend our fishing industry, our coastline and, additionally, to defend cables under the seas, for which all the onus seems to be on us. That cannot be done unless we have the personnel, fleet and wherewithal to do it. It is good that there has at least been some type of acknowledgement of that in recent years. It means the funding must be spent when it is there.",
                "There are other areas we need to look at. Housing was mentioned by my colleagues. There is also the case of the national children's hospital, which features year on year in these debates. The Bill sets out what we are spending and it is not working in terms of the national children's hospital because we still have not shifted everybody over there, as should have happened at this stage. It should have been opened several years ago if the Government had taken the proper tack. That was not to be and we still do not know whether it will open next year. We hope it will, at long last, and that local residents will have peace and quiet after the alarms have been going off in the hospital on an ongoing basis in recent weeks.",
                "I asked the Minister last week in the Chamber about the arts centre in the north inner city that is facing eviction on 14 January unless the State steps in and helps the people running the service with a capital injection to enable them to acquire the property and continue operating this important and eclectic arts centre. It is not a huge amount in the bigger scheme of things. The Government has proposed setting up some type of arts capital scheme based on the sports capital schemes. We would welcome if the Minister or some other Minister would take the opportunity this week to set out that the Government is fully behind the proposals for the arts centre and at least to get the landlord to back off and give the people running the centre some time.

                "I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. I recall the rushed nature of the debate on the corresponding Bill on the eve of the general election last November. As has been said on many occasions over the years, this legislation is, to some degree, a housekeeping exercise, as reflected in the Minister's comments, but it is nevertheless important that we have a Dáil debate on the matters the Bill addresses more broadly. As previous speakers noted, it was not that not long ago that the Dáil did not debate appropriations of this nature at all, with annual appropriations simply being nodded through. Our consideration of the Appropriation Bill allows us to take stock and think for a minute about the direction of public spending and how and why we allocate resources. That is the very essence of politics. Constitutionally, it is our job as Members of the Dáil to do so.",
                "There are few measures contained in the Bill that anyone will disagree with and nobody has any issue whatsoever with the Bill going through. I hope I speak for everyone in opposition on that count. It will ensure moneys are available into early next year to pay public servants, keep services going and provide for the carryover, within reason, of capital, accepting the complex and multi-annual nature of important capital projects. It will also ensure core social welfare payments are made seamlessly at the beginning of the new year.",
                "On the capital side, we ought to have a Dáil debate on our return in January on the recently published Accelerating Infrastructure plan. Such a debate has not yet happened. We in the Labour Party have given the general approach of the plan a measured and calibrated welcome, with some caveats in relation to what we view as dangerous limitations being placed on the right of citizens in this Republic to access what we might term environmental justice and to have access to the courts on important matters of justice and rights.",
                "Such is the dire situation with the delivery of housing, offshore energy, transport projects and so on, which are key to our economic performance and the success of our society, that any plan that envisages a new mission-orientated approach should be given a chance. Ministers and senior officials seem prepared to be accountable - in the truest sense of the word - for failure. A plan should be given a chance to prove its worth and value.",
                "We care about the future of the country, and we will not play opportunistic politics with a plan of this nature, but we will relentlessly hold the Government to account on any slippage and on any failures. This is far too serious a plan and far too serious a situation for us not to do that.",
                "To a degree, this kind of debate is almost at odds with the growing pattern evident in recent years of the weakening of the transparency framework around framing budgets and indeed the presentation and debating of spending plans, annual Estimates and Supplementary Estimates. This year the Dáil has been expected to approve, on the nod, Supplementary Estimates totalling around €4 billion. While this might be down on last year's figure, it is still an extraordinary ask of our National Parliament. The bizarre thing is that there is little or no real debate in this Chamber or in the line committees on the nature of the requests from Ministers for extra allocations. This has become an-all-too-frequent occurrence and now an almost routine part of the annual budgetary process. That this is the case raises very serious questions about how we do the people's business. It would be useful to have access to the Revised Estimates for 2026 in advance of a debate of this nature, so we can look at spending on a multi-annual basis in the round and make some comparisons.",
                "It is worth reminding ourselves that it is the constitutional function of TDs and the Dáil collectively to scrutinise Estimates, to amend and pass the annual budget and to hold the Executive to account. The reality is that the Executive sees the Dáil merely as a rubber-stamping Chamber. This is bad for our democracy and for the principle of good fiscal management. This year again, we were asked to nod through substantial Supplementary Estimates that are cumulatively the equivalent of the amount of revenue raised in corporation tax in any one year just over a decade ago. This puts the position we are in into some kind of context.",
                "Whether Ministers have the will to stay within the tramlines next year is an open question. We have a situation now in Ireland where budgets, as I have said repeatedly, have become works of fiction as Ministers have shown themselves incapable of responsibly controlling spending and staying within the confines of the sizeable allocations announced 13 or 14 months prior. We know for example that this year's budget saw total spending up by 12% on the 2025 Estimates. In budget 2026, we saw the largest allocation of public money ever, beating last year's record. That is required to meet the social and economic demands of a growing country, and the growing demands of the populace.",
                "It was a budget of over €9 billion, comfortably beating the last one, yet working people are still likely to be worse off than they were, largely thanks to decisions made on wasteful tax cuts brought in at the behest of noisy lobbyists. Responsible budgeting does not mean cuts. There should be no confusion about this. We can have responsible fiscal management and social and economic progress, imagination and innovation at the same time. They are not mutually exclusive. It is not a zero-sum game.",
                "I have said time and again that we cannot spend more and cut taxes at the same time, put that approach on a continuous rinse-and-repeat cycle, and expect an outcome that does not prove to be negative in the end. That is all at the same time as our tax base is at mortal risk. Given what we have seen in the last few budgets, Paschal was not prudent, and with his signature VAT cut for the burger barons, neither was Simon as sensible as the moniker he has given himself suggests.",
                "The Dáil needs to exercise its rights and constitutional functions when it comes to accountability for our public spending. This is precisely why I will shortly be publishing legislation to establish an office of an Estimates commissioner, which will greatly enhance the capacity and function of the Dáil to keep the Government honest on its in-year spending plans. There is a worrying opaqueness about how we allocate resources, and how we plan.",
                "Time and again, I have criticised the opacity around the presentation of the cost, for example, of maintaining existing levels of service, ELS. This is not an abstract point. It goes to the heart of the budgetary process. It suits the Government to be less than clear about what it costs to maintain basic levels of health, education and spending on other services, so it can juggle with the numbers, make itself look more responsible than it is, or alternatively pull some rabbits out of hats on or near budget day.",
                "For years, we have all been working on the basis that the summer economic statement was the gospel, published well ahead of the October budget, allowing for clear data on ELS for the subsequent year, and making it clear as well what fiscal space was available, on a more or less no-policy-change basis – in other words, what would be available for extra spending and additional tax-cutting measures when everything else is accounted for to keep the show on the road and meet evolving demographic needs.",
                "Clear data and better Dáil scrutiny of the data and figures would also help to keep the Opposition honest. It is not just about keeping the Government honest but about having an informed debate in this House on agreed numbers. The post-budget analysis of the Parliamentary Budget Office, PBO, does not pull any punches. For this year's budget, it says \"there is a noticeable absence of transparent, data-driven analysis to underpin fiscal decisions.\" It also states there is \"now no separation between the allocation given for new measures and funding required to maintain ELS, with the exception of the pay deal impact and carryover costs.\" Again this is not in any way an academic point, as it makes it difficult for all of us to conclude if the spending we are doing for this year and next year will in fact keep the show on the road at all. Will it help us to meet the challenges we have? Do we need more or less? What is the objective situation? It is hard to be definitive.",
                "Similarly, there are criticisms of what is termed the weak evidence base to inform some decisions contained in the PBO's analysis. For example, not all pledged tax expenditure reviews were published. We are also reminded that there have been no spending review papers published for 2025. This is really unforgivable in the current environment and it needs to change fast. Never before have we spent more as a country, yet there is an evident frustration that I have not seen for some time, if at all, about how the country simply is not working in a way that a rich country should. We are used to seeing Ireland as a two-tier country, but in my experience in recent times a three-tier Ireland is emerging. We are speaking about the Appropriation Bill, which in general terms is about spending and the allocation of resources. We need to be clear that the frayed social contract can only be repaired if we get better at generating and allocating the resources we need to make sure that everyone feels they have a stake in this evermore complex society.",
                "I will explain what I mean when I talk about a three-tier society. The resources of the top 10% of asset owners and income earners mean they have only heard mere talk of a cost-of-living and housing crisis. It has never visited their door. We have a cohort of people where the idea of a cost-of-living crisis now has a real permanence in their lives, and where the State needs to offer a better, more hopeful future for them and their children, as their prospect of progress seems more remote from their reality with every passing day. Then we have people on middle incomes, many of whom I have never seen as angry and frustrated as they are now. They see an economy that is objectively doing well but they do not feel that is the case for themselves. That is not their own experience. They are dealing with what I might term broken promises on reducing childcare costs. We will see what the Government publishes tomorrow in its childcare plan. People spend endless hours in cars driving from a home that is some distance from where they want to live to jobs where the salary would ordinarily have guaranteed them a good life, but now it does not. Instead of tax cuts and once-off payments to lessen the blow, it is affordable homes and decent universal public services - the kind which their peers in other wealthy countries have and take for granted - that they expect, and should be entitled to expect from a good government that has their backs. It is not much to ask in a country that is wealthier economically than it has ever been, and when we are debating, as we are today, the general allocation of resources in the broad sense. Our absolute focus in the future needs to be on investment in universal public services that work, and that are accountable, to give some hope of a better, fairer future for every citizen of this country."

The sewerage system, if you could call it that, is no more than an open pit and an Imhoff tank, which was probably built 70 years ago. It is fewer than 25 m from the local secondary school and about 150 m to 200 m from one of the 13 blue flag beaches in the county. It is a village that has been repeatedly overlooked for investment. I am asking the Minister to inject more money into the programme for wastewater treatment plant systems in Kerry and to include Castlegregory in that. There are ecological and health imperatives to this.",

In fact, there is an argument that it is actually worse coming out of the pit that is near the centre of the village than anywhere else. I would love to be able to say that Castlegregory is alone in this but there are other villages in Kerry such as Ballyduff, Fenit - which has a similar Imhoff tank or pit near another blue flag beach - and Abbeydorney, to name but a few, where more funding is necessary for these purposes.",
                "I also want to raise the need for a public building on the Denny site in Tralee. We recently asked for a meeting with Kerry County Council. There is a building that is owned, I understand, by a Canadian pension fund. The education and training board, ETB, the Courts Service and the HSE are renting properties from it. An opportunity has arisen because the old town council was granted a site on the old Denny factory in the middle of the town. The ETB is paying about €300,000 per year, the Courts Service is paying over €100,000 and the HSE refused to say how much it is paying when I asked it in a parliamentary question but I will get to the bottom of that later. The Minister can be sure that there is over €500,000 in State funding being paid every year for rental on this property. I ask the Minister to encourage Kerry County Council and make funding available to it in order to construct a building that will save money and bring the 140 people who are currently working there into the centre of town where they will be spending money on the retail offering that is in the town centre.",

                "This Bill is a constitutional requirement that is necessary to keep our public services running and keep the show on the road. It presents a good opportunity to scrutinise Government spending and take stock of what we should be doing better. It is remarkable that this Government managed to put together a €9.4 billion budget that leaves the most vulnerable worse off. The Government is spending like there is no tomorrow, according to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, but there are still well over 5,000 children who will spend Christmas in homeless emergency accommodation. That number has increased month after month since this Government took office. Disabled people have had their incomes cut by up to €1,400. Pensioners are afraid to turn on the heating. There are families struggling to afford the basics at the supermarket, so where exactly are these billions going? They are not being targeted at those who need it most.",
                "The budget should have been an opportunity to show foresight, discipline and responsibility. Instead, it has become a case study in how this Government ignores expert advice, dismisses the evidence and gambles recklessly with the future of our public finances. The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, the Nevin Economic Research Institute, the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, the Commission on Taxation and Welfare and the Parliamentary Budget Office, PBO, have all, in different ways, issued stark warnings and those warnings were ignored.",
                "The fiscal council warned that this Government's budgetary policy was adding fuel to an economic fire. It highlighted that spending growth was rising far above sustainable levels and that repeated budget over-runs were baked into the system. Most damning of all, it showed that our surpluses exist only because of windfall corporation tax receipts from a handful of multinationals. Strip those out and Ireland is already running a deficit of €7.4 billion in 2025, rising to €13.6 billion in 2026. These windfalls should have been invested in infrastructure projects that will benefit our long-term economic security. Instead, in large part, they were used to cut taxes for developers and fast-food chains. The council's verdict was devastating. On this, it said: \"The Government is budgeting like there is no tomorrow.\"",
                "The Nevin Economic Research Institute echoed these warnings. Before the budget, it said that fiscal policy was already running too hot. After the budget, its assessment was blunt. It said: \"We are channelling the 2000s with boom-time budgeting for a boom-time economy.\" It condemned the complacency bred by headline surpluses, which exist only because of corporation tax windfalls. It warned that if those receipts vanish, Ireland will be left with a massive deficit. It singled out one measure as particularly reckless: the VAT cut for the hospitality sector. In its words, wasting €700 million annually on a low-pay, low-productivity industry was \"a breathtakingly feckless waste of resources\". It pointed out some of the ways we could have used €700 million. We could have hired 11,000 additional nurses, made public transport free or lifted 50,000 children out of poverty. Instead, it was handed to the loudest lobby group.",
                "The ESRI gave similar warnings. In September, it warned that fiscal policy was pro-cyclical, stimulating demand in an economy already at or above capacity. It urged targeted investment in infrastructure bottlenecks and preparation for predictable long-term pressures like climate change and ageing. After the budget its analysis was damning. It found that budget 2026 would actually reduce disposable incomes with average losses of 2%. Low-income households were hit hardest, losing 4.1% of disposable income. Low-income households already making choices between heating or eating cannot afford any more cuts to their income. They do not have a single cent to spare. This shows the priorities of this Government and how out of touch it is. Those who are struggling get thrown under the bus while there are tax cuts aplenty for those at the top.",
                "The Commission on Taxation and Welfare provided the long-term roadmap. Its report, Foundations for the Future, made one point above all others: Ireland must broaden its tax base. It recommended shifting the balance of taxation away from labour and towards capital and consumption. It urged reforms to PRSI, increases in wealth taxes and a gradual phasing out of reduced VAT rates. Budget 2026 did the opposite. Instead of broadening the tax base, it narrowed it. Reckless VAT cuts were introduced for developers and fast-food chains in direct contradiction of the commission's recommendations. These cuts erode revenues and leave Ireland even more dependent on volatile corporation tax receipts.",
                "The commission's message was clear that Ireland's overall level of tax base must grow to meet the challenges of ageing, climate change and debt. Budget 2026 moved in the opposite direction. Finally the PBO was scathing in its assessment of budget 2026. It condemned the reckless tax cuts for hospitality and property developers and warned that subsidies of €675 million for developers were introduced without any analysis of how they interact with the housing market, whether they are effective or whether they create intended consequences. It warned that giant tax cuts for the hospitality sector were not likely to result in lower prices for consumers but instead would be pocketed by the likes of McDonald's and Domino's. The PBO analysis made it abundantly clear that budget 2026 was built on a weak evidence base with tax expenditures rolled out to the loudest lobby groups rather than meeting the greatest needs in the country.",
                "Let us take stock. The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council told us we are budgeting like there is no tomorrow, the Nevin Economic Research Institute warned that we are channeling the mid-2000s with boom-time budgeting and the ESRI told us we risk overheating and leaving ourselves exposed. The Commission on Taxation and Welfare previously warned that we need to broaden the tax base and yet the Government narrowed it. The PBO told us the reckless tax cuts for hospitality and property developers are fiscally unsustainable, economically unjustified and socially wasteful. These are five different independent bodies with five sets of warnings, all of which were ignored.",
                "Budget 2026 shows that the Government was unwilling to listen, plan and prepare with the advice that was given. It shows the Government choosing short-term politics over long-term sustainability and leaves Ireland dangerously exposed to the volatility of corporation tax, the predictable costs of an ageing population, the demands of climate change and the risk of future downturns. If it continues down this path, tomorrow will come with deficits, cutbacks and the public finance system unprepared for these challenges. These decisions were reckless. Government spending this year will be remembered for what it was: a story of bad choices and missed opportunities. The Government could have backed families struggling with energy bills. It could have abolished the means test for carers. It could have introduced a cost-of-disability payment, which was promised in a report in 2021 that has not yet been acted on. It could have reduced childcare costs as promised during the election, but that has not happened. It could have lifted 40,000 children out of poverty, but it did not. Instead it chose developers, large landlords and fast-food giants and chose recklessly to narrow our tax base. Once again, it shows that the priorities of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are more concerned with those at the top rather than looking after our long-term economic security. No amount of spin can disguise that. It can be seen. Rinne an Rialtas na roghanna míchearta. Má chaitheann muid súil siar at the mistakes that were made in the past in the run-up to the collapse of the Celtic tiger, we can see those same mistakes being repeated again. Céard atá ar siúl?"

We want to see projects that are not just spoken about but are actually invested in so that the money is put up-front and driven home. These projects include the N4 bypass in Carrick-on-Shannon in my own area, which is absolutely essential and needs to be done with haste. Anyone who travels from Sligo to Dublin most weekday evenings but certainly on a Friday evening knows that there could be a queue back almost as far as the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan's home town of Boyle. People are sometimes waiting for hours. This infrastructure badly needs to be put in place.",
                "The upgrade of the N17 is something we need to see delivered with haste as more and more people continue to lose their lives and the tragic accidents on that road continue to mount up every year. As we come to the end of another year, we all recognise the huge tragedy on our roads. Many of these road tragedies are a consequence of what were often called accident black spots but in actual fact are infrastructure deficits. These very dangerous multi-collision points on our roads need to be dealt with hastily.",
                "We need to see an upgrade of the Sligo-Dublin rail line. If I want to leave Dublin to go home on the train this evening, the last train leaves at 7.30 p.m. The last train to any region from the capital city should not be leaving at 7.30 in the evening. It should be leaving an awful lot later. We need better infrastructure and more frequency of services. We also need to see the introduction of a rail line in the western region. I welcome Irish Rail's recent decision that it is not interested in seeing a greenway being developed on the stretch of rail line that goes from Sligo to Galway, but wants to see a railway put on it. That is the western rail corridor, which has probably been talked about for generations at this stage. We need to see that put in place with haste and invested in because it can benefit the north west with significant advantages for people travelling through that region.",
                "There are many other infrastructural deficits that we see, with housing being the major one that captures everyone in every part of the country because it is the father and mother of many of our problems, for example in the health service and the education system. People cannot get housing. They cannot get places to live in. The reason developments cannot take place in many of the regions, including the north west, is that we do not have the water or wastewater infrastructure in place. In Carrick-on-Shannon, the development of water infrastructure is really serious and needs to be dealt with critically because it is at 110% capacity at the moment. That water treatment plant serves the whole of south Leitrim. If somebody comes in with planning permission in Mohill or Drumshanbo, they cannot get a letter from Uisce Éireann saying they will get a water connection because the water is not being delivered. All of these issues are having an impact.",
                "We also see the situation with the electricity grid being upgraded and the recent announcement about that. All of these things are welcome but we keep hearing more and more announcements, and those of us who live in the north west - certainly, in counties Leitrim or Sligo - see very little delivery. That is what needs to change. While we will support what is coming before us this evening in the context of this Bill, we need to see the investment on the ground. We need to see people out doing the work and we need to see delivery, and that needs to happen with haste."

                "This brings me to another project that has been proposed for many years in my constituency and neighbouring constituencies. I refer to the metro west project, which was cancelled during the recession by Leo Varadkar and pushed back until 2035. For those unfamiliar with it, it is a metro link from Tallaght through Clondalkin, Lucan and Liffey Valley shopping centre into Dublin 15 and around to Blanchardstown shopping centre, the National Aquatic Centre and the Dublin economic zone, where it is proposed to have up to 50,000 workers; and from Meakstown to the airport. The proposed metro line has been protected by various councils through county development plans and is mostly a greenfield site.",
                "Last week, it was announced that the M50 motorway in Dublin is officially at capacity and maxxed out with record traffic levels exceeding Celtic tiger numbers leading to severe congestion. It is now carrying 160,000 vehicles every day on average. The peak is closer to 190,000, making it Ireland's busiest road. Transport Infrastructure Ireland has acknowledged that the motorway is at its limit with little more physical capacity to add forcing a reliance on other solutions. This has led to extremely long commute times of sometimes more than three hours, gridlock for minor incidents and a negative impact on the economy, people and surrounding communities because it does not just affect the M50. It affects our community as well when the traffic is backed up all through the N3, through Blanchardstown and Dublin 15 and up to Tyrrelstown. Experts and officials point to a significant investment in public transport such as DART and Luas, better cycling infrastructure and policy changes to shift commuters away from cars as the only real fix. Transport Infrastructure Ireland has stated that it has done all it can physically do and that solutions require significant policy changes, increased public transport and investment in alternatives.",

It is designed to link at St. Mochtas Football Club in Clonsilla with DART+, providing a direct link to the city centre. It would also link with the huge developments now being built at Kellystown, Clonsilla and Castleknock, and provide transport links to the Blanchardstown Centre, the National Aquatic Centre, the sports campus at Abbotstown, the Dublin economic zone and on to the airport.",
                "Given our road network system is now pretty much at capacity in the city, is it not time we have a real look at metro west? Is it now time to look at funding for the future? We know if we delay, then it will cost billions and billions more. This has been in the planning for 20 plus years. It was delayed because of the recession. At the time, maybe you could understand that but now there is no excuse. There is no excuse whatsoever, given the total gridlock on the M50 and surrounding areas, not to proceed with metro west. I urge the Minister, when he talks to his colleagues around the Cabinet table, to bring this forward. We have been talking about this for seven or eight years now. Let us bring it forward and get it delivered for people right the way from Tallaght all the way to the airport."

It is a tradition in Limerick that Fossett's Circus comes there. Fossett's Circus does a charity night, every time it comes to Limerick, for people just to go to see a circus. It offers a full night. It offered me tickets to give to agencies that want to go to see a circus. I go to different communities that offer the same but when it comes to governance, the same thing is not awarded. A crèche in Banogue is waiting for a letter from Uisce Éireann. The funding is there to build it to support the local school and local families who are working in the area. A letter from Uisce Éireann to say it will now upgrade the system is all that is wanted for the local authority to give the go-ahead. It has been going around in circles for three months now. People want to start it for the betterment of the community.",
                "We talk about where our tax is going and the minimum wage. I have no problem with a wage increase but if it does not make a difference in the pockets of the people getting it, I do have a problem with it. We see today that the minimum wage of €13.50 will be increased to €14.15, which will give a person an increase of €26. It is not an increase of €26, however, because of the tax bands. When the USC charge was lowered, the Government never moved the tax bands, so that person will pay more tax on it. When you break it down, take off the 1.5% auto-enrolment, which is also starting in January, and keep breaking it down, the person who will get the minimum wage increase is not getting an increase. What it does is drive inflation because people on the other side have to put up their costs.",
                "People asked me why the hospitality sector got a reduction in VAT. The hospitality sector is one of the cases where the minimum wage will come in. It will have four wage increases coming next January, in the short term. If you add that to the knock-on process of all the different wage increases across the sector, the 4% decrease it got will not add a cent to inflation. At the Committee on Budgetary Oversight that I chair, I asked people from the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, whether it would create an inflation cost; it would not. What it does is absorb the costs the sector has got in the past three years, and stops it increasing the price of food, beverages and everything within that sector. It was the right thing to do. I thank the Government for eventually doing it because, otherwise, it will be a circular economy. It will come back around to the same people who have got the wage increase paying more for the same product.",
                "We then look at every person who is paying PRSI and PAYE, who is also paying into the National Training Fund, but it does not actually go to funding national training. It goes around; it was voted on recently that it be used to buy up properties. It is taking from a fund for training people. That money has been sitting in accounts and building up for years. It could never be touched but now the Government wants it to go into something that is not based on training.",
                "We have a lot of very good projects that could be built. We talked about UHL today. I thank the Minister for saying that she is looking at options A and B, and all the sectors of it, but it is about the delivery of this. We are talking about 36 beds being delivered next year and it is hoped to increase that to 178 beds before 2030. The commercial sensitivity of getting extra lands is being talked about. We have also talked about developers saying they will build it on the same basis as a mortgage system, where they will build it, give it back, and it will cost a euro. If they do not have the funding to deliver it now, they will deliver the project within two years to help people save lives. How many more people's lives will it take before the Government listens to businesspeople and lets them deliver the infrastructure and buildings for it? It can then invest in the healthcare that needs to go into these buildings. How many more people will die before we do that?",
                "We are at Christmastime. I was at a funeral during the week. One person turned around to me after she buried her mother and said, \"Please, please, please Richard, if you do anything, will you please sort out UHL?\". A new CEO is coming in place. I hope and pray they have the capability to bring people with them to get the adequate staff that hospital needs. There is one accident and emergency department for 45,000 people. Hospitals were downgraded without thinking of the impact of an increasing population. That is recklessness. People are dying needlessly, while they are waiting for care. On the other side of that, people do not want to be employed by the hospital because of the stigma that was attached to it. Something radical needs to change. The management in place at the moment are trying to change it. They have been in contact with us in trying to change this but unless they get the proper staffing and proper people employed there, they cannot do that. It goes back to the question of how many more people have to die before the Government listens to people who can deliver infrastructure for it.",
                "I have been talking here about this, and I know the Minister has looked at certain parts of it. I will give him praise for what he does. He has listened to us talking about delivery of public versus private, and looking at budgets for delivery of public buildings that are privately built and then taken over by the public. We are looking at delivery of infrastructure that will then be given over to the likes of Uisce Éireann, where it will be built on time and on budget, making money travel further. We will get delivery faster. That is what it is about.",

We have asked the Government to bring it up to 63 sq. m to allow for liveable accommodation. If elderly people said they would move into the modular unit to let the family move into their house, it would not be big enough to accommodate them either because the Government does not have the foresight to allow for a two-bedroom unit to be built on-site, which would be 63 sq. m. We are now looking at 45 sq. m. Will it not look at this again? What happens if a person living in the modular unit gets sick and somebody has to move in to take care of them? What happens if a carer is coming in to take care of an elderly parent? It is simple legislation. Listen to the people who know about it.",

Costings have to be evenly based across the board to make sure their Department is accountable. That means they could deliver more for less."

It is an astonishing attack on ordinary small businesses throughout the country that they come in here time and again condemning the Government for lowering that VAT rate when we know, as do the people on the ground, that it will mean the very survival of a lot of cafes throughout the country.

That is a serious blow to anybody, regardless of what they think people have. I would appreciate it if the Government looked at that again.

There is nothing - zero. The AIRO report a number of years ago was drawn up by an independent body for Cork County Council and made it clear that Cork County Council was getting the lowest amount of money for roads and for so many other budgets. Nothing has changed. On roads all the way from Innishannon to Skibbereen you cannot pass a car. I hear the Minister goes to Kinsale on and off for meetings and things like that. You cannot pass a car. There are no passing bays. People are pulling the hair out their heads. This leads to accidents, unfortunately. It is time to spend money on roads. We do not have rail. That should surely mean extra would be put into roads in those areas if they do not have rail. We do not even have a sign for 150 km of roadway to rail in west Cork.

I am asking for common sense passing bays and they are refused continuously. God almighty, if they would step aside for six-months, we would have it done. We would need no help. We would put in a machine and get the goddamn roads widened and let people get on with their business. We would let the tractor and the lorry driver drive on the N71 and spend an hour or hour and a half getting from A to B while not holding up the motorist who is trying to get on with their business.

Jesus, you would not expect that in a dictator's world but we are accepting it in this country. The Minister is the man with his fingers on the purse and he has to ask whether this money is being spent properly. Are these landowners being dictated to? In the Cooley Peninsula, 1,000 people attended a meeting two weeks ago in a fury about their land being taken from them. God almighty, the Minister would not expect his land to be taken from him and neither would I. We expect that there is a right for these genuine, hardworking farming people to have their land swiped from under them, whether they like it or not that. That is where the wastage of money is coming into play. The people of Kilcrohane, the Sheep's Head Peninsula, the Sheep's Head way and the Beara Way were never dictated to. There was never a CPO put on lands, only a lovely walkway made with consultation. TII can now dictate by wagging a CPO in front of somebody. We have to cop on.

The fact is there is absolute fear that people's homes or farms could be CPOd and there is an element of Louth County Council and TII having lost the dressing room too early. There is a need for a greater level of engagement but I know Anton Waters and many other elected representatives have looked for almost a postponement of the review process that is ongoing on the delivery of CPOs. I call on the Minister and Government to do what they can on this because we have all seen greenways delivered, and very delivered well.

In my part of the world, we are forced into the scenario of the delivery of interim wastewater schemes as new housing schemes are built. This will obviously lead to added cost. I know the Minister has dealt with some of these issues previously, or is at least aware of them. This just tells you where wastewater capacity is in Louth. In certain parts of Dundalk, it leads to real fear of flooding, even in the part of the world I live in. I mention Dundalk south, anywhere from Cluan Enda right through to Bay Estate and beyond. These are very particular issues that need to be looked at.",
                "I brought up the issue of CFRAM earlier with the Taoiseach and Minister of State, Deputy Moran. We have several projects throughout Louth but let us talk about the Dundalk-Blackrock south project. We are looking at quarter 4 of 2027 for submission of planning permission. That is a long way from what we need to protect the homes CFRAM was designed for. In fairness, the Minister has agreed to look at Blackrock and the likes from the point of view of whether there could be flood mitigations introduced before the proper flood mitigations but none of this is good enough.",
                "I have brought up the issue of schools, including Ardee Educate Together National School. We have to improve the planning process and the Ceann Comhairle will have heard me speaking about this before. We have a new school build of €7.6 million and this has been an ongoing project since 2012. We are looking at 34 staff and at best, there will be 21 parking spaces, of which three will be disabled parking bays. You are also looking at a place that has minibuses delivering to five ASD classes, for which there are only two parking bays. These are issues that need to be delivered on. I spoke to Louth County Council which is one of the facilitators in relation to this. I spoke to the planning department which said we could look at anything in relation to retention and whatever-----"

This reflects the Estimates voted by the Dáil over the course of this year, including Revised, Further Revised and Supplementary Estimates. In gross terms and taking into account expenditure on the Social Insurance Fund and the National Training Fund, the total gross voted expenditure made available this year is €109.9 billion. As Deputy Ó Murchú said, the Appropriation Bill is a technical piece of legislation that authorises in law all the expenditure that has been agreed by way of Estimates during the year.",
                "The House will be aware the passage of the Bill is required to ensure it is possible to make payments in 2026 in respect of services that were funded from voted expenditure this year, including jobseeker's allowance, disability allowance, non-contributory State pension, nurses pay, Garda pay, teachers pay and all those who pay on pensions funded from voted money, payment of suppliers for goods and services, including SMEs. Of fundamental importance to those who depend on our essential public services is the passage of the Appropriation Bill which will allow for the payments required to deliver these public services to continue in 2026.",
                "Government continued investment in our ongoing critical public services during 2025, with a significant proportion of gross voted current expenditure allocated in the areas of health, housing, social protection, education and justice, all of which provide essential front-line public services. The funding provided this year will support a sustainable delivery of public services and infrastructure, providing a clear vision for the continuous improvement of public services, living standards and the infrastructure. This expenditure will ensure investment in better public services, anticipating and meeting the needs of our growing and changing population, and investment in digitalisation and climate initiatives.",
                "To address our infrastructure needs, Government has made clear capital investment is a priority for the years ahead. As part of this prioritisation, Government has completed a review of the national development plan which was published in July of this year. The NDP review is the most ambitious investment plan launched in the history of the State. The review provides us with the potential to transform our built environment, through permanent and sustainable interventions focused on the medium- and long-term health of our economy and country. Taking into account the total gross voted capital expenditure for 2026, set out in the budget and the addition of capital carryover in the Appropriation Bill, over €19.3 billion will be available for capital spending next year. The increased investment plays an important role in delivering much-needed public infrastructure across Ireland and the sectors such as social housing, education and higher education, primary healthcare, public transport, water infrastructure, climate change adaption and mitigation.",
                "In 2024, due to an unexpected shortfall in appropriation-in-aid not matched by consummate savings and expenditure subheads, an excess Vote of €9,680 was recorded for the 2024 Appropriation Account for Vote 14 - State Laboratory. This led to a net deficit in the Vote, which the Comptroller and Auditor General referred to at the public accounts committee.",
                "At a committee meeting on 9 October 2025 the Comptroller and Auditor General referred the excess expenditure recorded for Vote 14 to the committee. The committee noted the Accounting Officer had stated that the State Laboratory has implemented appropriate procedures to prevent a similar situation arising in the future. In light of the assurances from the Accounting Officer, the committee saw no objection to this sum being provided by Excess Vote. The committee agreed an interim report at its meeting of 9 October 2025 in respect of excess expenditure incurred by the State Laboratory, indicating that the committee saw no objection to the sum provided by excess Vote.",
                "Our social protection system seeks to provide an effective social safety net for the more vulnerable members of society and when expenditure on the Social Insurance Fund is included, the 2025 gross expenditure allocation for social protection is €27.5 billion. This allows delivery of an adequate and sustainable social protection and pension support system and better outcomes in tackling poverty through providing a wide range of income support schemes. It helps to support the standard of living of the most vulnerable in our society. In particular, funding provided in 2025 enabled improvements in the social welfare system for people on a range of income supports, as well as providing additional support for families and people on illness programmes, disability programmes and carers' programmes. For example, 2035 funding enabled a €12 increase in core weekly social welfare rates, an increase in the weekly rates of child support payments by €4 for under 12s and €8 for over 12s. There was a €60 increase in the working family payment income thresholds and an extension of fuel allowance to those in receipt of carer's allowance. There was also the introduction of a €280 newborn grant for each child born in the State to help parents with the initial costs of parenting.",

In 2024, 10,581 new social homes were delivered, including 7,857 new-build homes, 1,501 acquisitions and 1,223 homes delivered through the leasing programmes. In the first six months of 2025, 3,918 affordable housing options were delivered, which represents 61% of 2025's delivery target. This is a 44% increase in delivery compared to the same period in 2024. The biggest drivers of affordable delivery were first home schemes with 1,558; vacant property refurbishment grants, 1,334; AHB cost-rental, 497; and local authority affordable purchase, 359.",

To support the education of these students a record number of teachers totalling approximately 78,000 are employed by the Department of Education and Youth. In addition, over 700 new teachers were employed in September 2035 for the commencement of the 2025-26 school year. To support the education of students with special educational needs over 400 new special classes were sanctioned for the 2025-26 school year. This brings the total number of special classes to over 3,700. Five new special schools were confirmed for the 2025-26 school year, bringing the total to 129 special schools, catering for approximately 9,000 children and young people with complex special educational year. Alongside this increase in special classes and special schools is an increase of the number of SNAs. There was an increase of a further 1,600 special needs assistants in September 2025, bringing the total number of SNAs working in schools to over 20,000. Capital funding in 2025 will amount to €1.6 billion to support a continued progression of the circa 300 building projects in the school building programme that are currently at construction stage.",

There was a continuation of the fare initiatives, the 20% adult fare discount, the 50% discount and a 90-minute fare which reduce the cost of public transport and encourage modal shifts. Progress was made on the construction of the first 12 BusConnects phase 4 bus corridors, with a second due to begin in early 2026.",

                "It came as a shock to many patients when they received letters from pharmacists or were told orally by pharmacists that the blister packs that were previously funded and paid for, as they saw it, were now going to be subject to a charge from 1 January 2026 onwards. It is important to point out that these are very vulnerable patients. The vast majority of them are older people, over the age of 65. They are people with dementia, disabilities and a range of health needs, but they are the most vulnerable patients. The vast majority of people will not need blister packs, but for those who do, they are a necessity and they are important for a number of purposes. They help patients manage medicines, and they are also a very important aid and tool for carers and family members. I know from my own siblings and others who look after people that they have to make sure that the blister pack is out, the patient uses the appropriate medication and everybody benefits from it. It is really good for patients and there was an awful shock, when patients received notification formally or informally that this was going to come to an end and they will have to have to pay for it. Sometimes we lose sight of the fact that €20, €40 or €50 a month is a huge amount for some people. We cannot ever live in a bubble here in Leinster House. We have to understand that this type of charge is a loss for a person who is on a very low income, a disability payment or a low-paid pension. For those people to be hit with this additional charge really did come as a shock to them and their families and to carers. However, it was not a shock to me that this was going to happen because I raised it directly with the Minister. I also issued a press statement at the time when the new community pharmacy agreement was put in place. I recognised this as a glaring omission and I warned that this would become an issue and unfortunately, it did. I understood the importance of them for patients and families and I certainly knew that when the time came and people realised that what they were getting previously free of charge and covered was going to be to be subject to a charge, would go down very badly and rightly so. It has been described as cruel by many people who have texted into radio programmes over the past week as well.",
                "The Minister issued a statement on Friday of last week saying that she would put on hold the new community pharmacy agreement for a couple of months. The reason she gave for putting it on hold was rightly, that there is a lot of additional work for pharmacists. They are administering the flu vaccine and the Covid vaccine, which I got myself in a pharmacy last week. There is obviously additional work in managing diseases and the flu circulating in the community and other issues that pharmacists are dealing with. That was the reason the Minister gave. Nowhere in the press statement did she say she would look at this. In fact, she described blister packs as being private fees. In a response she gave in the Seanad, she doubled down as well on that."

It seems that this was funded through the phased dispensing scheme and that pharmacists were essentially offsetting the cost of blister packs through phased dispensing. Whatever about the rights and wrongs of that at this point in time, many of these people who were previously getting it funded now have to pay and they simply cannot afford to do so. We are being constructive in tabling this motion to ask the Minister to engage and to look at putting in place a scheme whereby this can be funded. There are different ways this can be done. She could allow GPs, for example, to determine whether, through the same funding pot as phased dispensing, we provide for blister packs as well. Obviously, funding into the pot could be increased. There are a lot of options open to the Minister. However, the option of saying \"No\" will not win over the support of those people who are now, as they see it, being left high and dry.",

The only thing that matters for them and their families is that they are now facing an additional cost, and that is very unfair on those patients."

While the Government has stalled it for a few months, leaving a weight of uncertainty over many families, this policy decision goes far beyond a simple financial blow to some of the most vulnerable in our society; this is an attack on their independence.",
                "For over 20 years I worked as a carer for adults with additional needs. I saw first-hand what these blister packs meant. They were not a luxury; they were a lifeline. They gave people the freedom to manage their own medication safely without constant supervision. They preserved dignity and enabled independence. The Minister can try to push the narrative that blister packs are unnecessary and that people can manage just fine without them, but the ordinary people, like the people across Carlow-Kilkenny whom I represent, can see through this spin. Most of us have had a loved one at some stage who has relied on this simple, effective system. We have seen the independence it has given our loved ones. How the Government can justify tax breaks for the likes of McDonald's and Starbucks while imposing this charge on older people managing multiple medications - people living with dementia, disabilities or brain injuries - is beyond me. This move will reduce people's independence. It will heap pressure on family carers. It risks poorer medication adherence, leading to avoidable harm and higher long-term costs for our health service. Let us be crystal clear: this decision will damage lives. This is not just poor policy; this is heartless. I urge the Minister to reverse this decision."

When people went to their chemist or learned about this, it was very hard for them to understand why a government would come to such a decision because these blister packs are essential to people who have conditions such as Alzheimer's and dementia and other vulnerable categories of patient. A lot of these people are on not just one or two tablets a day but multiple tablets. Sometimes the administration of the medication to people is quite complex, so it is vital for their health that they have the ability to avail of these blister packs. People have gone into a chemist and learned about this during a cost-of-living crisis. Many of the people who were retrieving these medications from the chemist are themselves on carer's allowance or something like that, are responsible for the care of their parent, their adult child or another loved one, and are being hit by perhaps €20, €40 or €50 a month in additional charges if we are talking about two people whom they are caring for. It is therefore quite understandable why people are responding to this and believing that it is cruel and heartless in relation-----"

A total of 21% of households that have one or more members with a disability are materially deprived. Some 20% of those are in poverty. Some 16% of people over 65 are in poverty. The extra €20, €30, €40 or €50 per month is therefore not nothing; it is massively significant to people who have already been pushed into poverty by the decisions of this Government. As my colleagues have outlined, these blister packs are an essential organisational tool for people who are trying to manage their medication but who have difficulty doing so. Basic patient safety means that they must have access to blister packs or else they must have access to somebody who will help them to take their medication, but the latter robs them of their independence. As they get older, people with disabilities will say that their world becomes very small as they become more and more dependent and as society disables them. This will further increase their loss of independence.",

I raised this with the Minister over a month ago, and her response, in effect, was to deny that there was or has been an issue at all until, that is, the public outcry became much too much. Pharmacists are being asked to play an ever more important and front-line role within our communities, and it is time Fine Gael treated them with respect. We had a similar fiasco at the onset of the year, when despite promising a free HRT scheme through pharmacies from January, the roll-out was delayed because the Minister simply could not get the job done on time. That was not a pharmacist issue; that was the Minister's issue, and so too is this. While the Government attempts to muddy the water, the fact of the matter is that reimbursement for blister packs was known and has been understood by the Government. The Minister sought to withdraw this crucial support, she got called out for it and she has backed down for now. Vulnerable patients who rely on these packs to manage the dosage of their medication cannot be asked to stump up as much as €50 per month arising from the inept leadership of this Government. Many will not or cannot, and that is a public health concern of the her making.",

It is really important that we take the opportunity because a lot of people have been very frightened by this debate.",
                "I note from the comments that have been made in the first 20 minutes of the debate that not one of the Deputies referenced the many constituents who have been paying for blister packs for some time. I know they have that information because my colleagues also represent those constituents. I also know from their social media accounts how many people have contacted them to tell them they have already been paying for blister packs for some time. They have been paying fees of €10 or €20 for some time. This is, and always has been, a private service. It was never funded by the State and there has been no removal of that service by this State. The Irish Pharmacy Union, IPU, confirmed that in a statement on Friday.",
                "I will outline what is different. There have been three groups of people. The first is those people who know they have always been paying for blister packs as a private service. They know that, we know that and Sinn Féin knows that because much of the commentary on Deputies' social media posts have told them that if their constituents have not. They have not taken the opportunity to reference that during the debate. Those people have been paying for blister packs as a private service. Another group of people have been getting blister packs for free because their pharmacists are giving them blister packs for free. I thank those pharmacists. There is a third group of people whose pharmacists have been giving them blister packs for free but charging the State under a different heading, as Deputy Cullinane referenced. They have been charging under the phased dispensing scheme, which is a very different scheme. Charging like that is wrong, inappropriate and contrary to numerous circulars that the HSE has issued. There is litigation to this effect against a sizeable private company that was wrongly doing this. There have been two sets of litigation and the State won on both occasions. It is wrong to give a service to someone and to charge the State wrongly under a different scheme. That is wrong, and I am glad that we have the opportunity to highlight that very wrong practice that some pharmacists in the State have been carrying out.",
                "This afternoon, I spoke with the regulator. It, along with the HSE, will be looking at this issue very clearly. They will be looking at the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, data. People have received letters. There should be no change for those first two groups of people. If you have already been paying for blister packs, there will be no change under the community pharmacy agreement. If it has been free, I ask people to go in and speak to their pharmacists. Will it continue to be free? If it has been free, it will probably continue to be. If people have received letters, perhaps they want to share them with the regulator. It might be a scenario where a pharmacist who had previously been claiming under the wrong scheme is now trying to put the cost on the patient. As everybody here has correctly said, that is wrong.",
                "We are responsible for the money that taxpayers pay the State, which is then given to pharmacists. We are giving new funding of €50 million for pharmacists, as well as the funding within the pharmacy scheme. It is wrong for taxpayers' money to be used in a way that is not allocated. It is really important for me, even though it might not be as glamorous as simply just solving the problem, to take the time to get to the bottom of the issue and fix it over time, as I did with hormone replacement therapy, HRT.",
                "The many women who are enjoying their completely free HRT are the beneficiaries of that little extra time it took to do the job properly. In the same way, we will get to the bottom of the information here and find out who has been charging this inappropriately and how the regulator or others purport to deal with that. There are many people who have been charging.",
                "Phased dispensing is a really important protection for people, particularly those getting psychotropic drugs, opioids and codeine. Those drugs are dispensed, and pharmacists are paid to dispense them, on a weekly basis or even in some cases on a daily basis. That is for the safety of the patient. Although we assumed together and I certainly assumed in relation to blister packs that it was a patient safety measure and a convenience - a whole range of different good things - actually the evidence is quite different. That is something we could talk about if we had more time or if we were more committed to the details of science. I really hope we have that conversation. We all agree here as public representatives that where somebody has gotten used to having a blister pack or chooses to have a blister pack, I can completely see how that has been a good and positive thing, even if some of the medical perspectives are very different.",
                "The groups we would be most concerned about are already the groups that pharmacists and GPs are most concerned about. If someone is getting phased dispensing, for example, as Deputy Cullinane has said, it is already the case that a GP has to sign off on that. There needs to be evidence in a pharmacy that it is being correctly done on a weekly or daily basis as appropriate. That body of evidence should be there if phased dispensing is being used correctly. That might sound very technical to people watching tonight, and I totally get that, but it is taxpayers' money. We cannot have any profession using taxpayers' money in a way that has not been allocated, especially where that has been repeatedly communicated to them. It is an important marker. It is the responsibility of the Government and everybody here who is responsible for taxpayers' money. It is a different thing from making sure we continue to reassure people.",
                "Of all of the constituents who got in touch with the Deputies opposite on their social media, not one of them said they were already paying €50, because I checked. That is something that came into the vernacular last week, which was frightening for people and it was wrong. Whoever had an incentive to put figures like that into the media or into the debate knew what they were doing and knew it was not reflective of the practice that exists currently, where we are seeing fees of between €5 and €20, as reflected on the Deputies' own social media. That was a wrong thing for those people to do; it was frightening and wrong. I can completely understand why people would be so upset about that, especially when times are hard, especially in the winter and especially where it is perceived to be a new charge somebody is imposing and people do not have the information as to what has gone on in the backdrop.",
                "I am very glad for this opportunity to clear this up; I think it is the right thing to do. I am also glad we have taken the opportunity to put a pause on this to get the best information and to work out with the clinical community which people need blister packs and for whom they should be provided, and how we as a State make sure our resources are going to protect the most vulnerable and not everybody. Some of the commentary and what has been said already may imply that we should reward those pharmacists who have been using the State's money wrongly for this by simply covering it off. I would rather show the Irish people what was going on first and then protect the vulnerable. Some of the commentary refers to people who are already paying it. What is going to happen to them? What have they been doing for some time? That was a private service. It was never a State-funded service. There was nothing to withdraw. There was no Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil withdrawing from anything because it was never funded by the State. We have to have transparency in a developed State. We have to have the ability to set things out clearly and honestly. I am very glad for the opportunity Sinn Féin Deputies have provided with their time for us to be able to do that and place real clarity on it. I thank the Deputies for their engagement and for highlighting this important issue so that we can get to the bottom of what is truly a risk to people who are vulnerable and something that has perhaps been inflated by those who might have an incentive to cover what was done in the past and create very scary figures for private services for the future.",
                "I had a very important conversation with the regulator today. There will immediately be an analysis by the PCRS which the regulator may be involved with at any stage, and then we will lean into it in a much deeper way as the process goes on with an analysis of the phased dispensing claims that have been made to the HSE in a specific timeframe. This will be to examine what the criteria might be for any outliers in the phased dispensing scheme that may help to highlight those pharmacies that are in difficulties, and to have a very suitable, targeted probity process and targeted interventions and actions as may be appropriate, to be determined by the regulator. If there is a person in this House who disagrees with that course of action, I would like to hear about it. It is very important. Separately, the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, as the regulator, will support with any necessary follow-up actions.",
                "We are introducing transparency in pharmacy. There are so many good pharmacists who are going above and beyond for their patients every single day. We all know who they are. They are absolutely brilliant. Their first concern and one of their obligations is to put patient safety first. That is what they do. They are obliged by their profession to take care of their patients. They are obliged to make sure that patients understand their medication and receive their medication in a way that is capable of being understood and is going to keep them safe. That is their obligation. There are so many pharmacists who are doing that well. It is also true to say that there has been too much hidden in the charging in pharmacies, whether it is dispensing fees, as was shown through the HRT debate, or transparency on other things like private services that are reasonably paid for, like blister packs, BMI and a whole range of different things. That is why, along with the pharmacy regulator, I have required detailed receipts outlining the cost of every professional service that pharmacists should be allowed to charge for their expertise, including dispensing fees and a whole range of other things that Deputies Cullinane, Sherlock, Rice and I have discussed a number of times. Pharmacists are entirely entitled to charge for their expertise, but it should be transparent to their customers. This debate has helped to shine another light on the need for transparency in pharmaceutical services and I thank the Deputies for bringing this motion tonight."

                "I am glad the Minister has recognised that there has been confusion, a lack of clarity and three different types of scenarios in the way this money has been dispensed. I received an email from one constituent informing me that on her last visit to the chemist to pick up her 80-year-old mother's prescriptions, she was informed that the blister pack charge would be increasing to €7.50 per week from 1 January 2026. She was shocked at the extra €5 per week, an increase of 200%. She said that she currently pays €10 a month for the packs but from 1 January, it will be €30, an extra €20 per month. She felt that this was scandalous. If ever there was an issue where the Department did not know on a practical level that the facts of the situation were that the phased dispensing scheme was being used to pay for these, it was this. I could instance hundreds of different ways where I feel the HSE is paying too much. It recently purchased a building in Tralee. The site was previously purchased for about €160,000 two or three years ago, and the HSE recently purchased it for €4.2 million. I know they are paying hundreds of thousands in rent for the primary care centre in Tralee. When I ask how much they are paying for it, they refuse to confirm the amount, probably because they are embarrassed as to how much they are paying. It is not a good use of taxpayers' money.",
                "It is a fact that these blister pack monitored dosing systems have been widely used. Whether it is part of the scheme or not, the Minister accepts that there is confusion. Nearly everyone here knows someone who has used it, is using it or should be using it, particularly older vulnerable people with dementia, brain injuries and disabilities. The monitored dosing systems were historically reimbursed in practice through phased dispensing, as the Minister has admitted, which was in reality known to everybody who was involved in the system. We raised the concerns in October. They were ignored and it is only now the Minister is dealing with it. I am glad to hear she will be addressing it in the future."

The second statement, that the Minister is pausing them until 2026, has added further to the confusion for thousands of people who mostly subsist on disability pensions and occupational injury pensions. The severe impact of withdrawing funding for blister pack medication is quite evident in the many emails and complaints I have received in my office from across County Wexford. I received correspondence from an 82-year-old woman's daughter, who is her carer. This woman is blind and has Parkinson's disease. She is on six different medications a day. The daughter has a genuine fear of her mother ending up in hospital or being harmed due to taking the wrong medication. It is genuinely creating a high-risk health and safety issue for both mother and daughter.",

I asked for trays for three reasons: one, to ensure he was taking his tablets correctly; two, to reduce the mental load of being carer for myself; and three, to reduce conflict in the home. My husband was an intelligent man, but his illness affected him mentally and physically as all illnesses do to everyone.",
                "The decision to postpone funding for blister packs is a diabolical one and must be reversed, not postponed or put on the back burner. What most of our vulnerable citizens need now is clarity, protection and a guaranteed assurance that their blister packs will continue to be funded on a permanent basis. I urge every Member of the Oireachtas to support this motion."

The Government is on about a cost-of-living crisis, and it brings in this extortionate disgusting charge on blister packs for people. It was brought in originally in 1996 as a health and safety issue. Now, everything is after getting fixed. I was in Market Green in Midleton last Saturday and Santy was there, believe it or not. Santy pulled me aside and asked me what the bloody hell is happening with the blister packs. This is a fact. We had a good conversation. He told me that he and his wife, Mrs. Claus - they are pushing on now - are disgusted at what is happening. On top of that, I can guarantee that the Minister is definitely on the naughty list this year anyway when it comes to them."

What we are seeing here is all too familiar. The most vulnerable people in Clare and across the State are being given a small rise on one hand, only to have to have it taken straight back on the other. That is not progress. It is not fair. It certainly is not protecting those who rely on these vital lifesaving supports. I have listened carefully to those who came to me. This decision does not just affect those who use blister packs; it affects carers, families and loved ones who depend on this lifeline to keep people safe. These supports help elderly people, people with physical disabilities and those living with cognitive impairment of all ages.",

You ring an ambulance, and you are asked a simple but critical question, \"Have they taken their medication?\" but you cannot answer because their blister pack is not there. You do not know if they have double dosed, triple dosed or taken none at all. Blister packs provide answers to those questions that can save lives. Imagine trying to live as independently as possible with a disability only to have a simple lifesaving support priced out of your reach. The loss of independence forces people to rely on others and even they may not have someone to rely on. It is not acceptable. Sinn Féin believes people should be able to live in dignity and safely. I implore the Minister to give some people hope this Christmas that they will not face the cost of funding for a device that is not a luxury but a necessity."

The decision now to target the pharmacies exposes how out of touch this Government is. Constituents contacted my office shocked and afraid about what the new year will bring. One man wrote to me. Michael and his wife are both pensioners. Each of them takes seven tablets a day for conditions, including blood pressure issues, mental health needs and recovery from a recent heart attack. Their pharmacist has now told them that they will face an extra €50 per month. This is money that they simply do not have. At the most expensive time of the year in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis, patients now find themselves having to pay for a safety-critical service regardless of income. There is no justification for that. The evidence is clear: removing access to monitored dosage systems will worsen medication adherence, increase hospital admissions and deepen health inequality. Community pharmacists are uniquely placed to prevent that harm, but they cannot continue to provide this service at a loss. Healthcare should be based on clinical need, not ability to pay. This House should stand with the most vulnerable and not abandon them."

We should be spending time talking about improvements to the health service but instead we are talking about a service that is effectively going backwards. The reality is that when we were talking about the community pharmacy agreement in October in this House, I raised issues about phased dispensing and blister packing. There was no action from the Minister or her Department. It is only when uproar has arisen in the past week that she has responded to say that she has to try to work things out. We all know that blister packing is separate from phased dispensing, but the reality is that many pharmacists were using the money they were receiving for phased dispensing to put together blister packs for their patients. Blister packing is the dinosaur of medical technology, but it works in terms of ensuring that vulnerable patients and patients with a disability get the appropriate medication. It prevents unnecessary hospitalisation, it gives peace of mind to families and it is utterly consistent with the perspective that we should try to keep people at home.",
                "As I said in this Chamber two months ago, it is a real backwards step in the new community pharmacy agreement that the Government would reduce from four to two the number of criteria to be eligible for phased dispensing. As many pharmacists will not be getting that money for phased dispensing, the free blister pack service that many patients were availing of is coming to an end and they will have to pay for it. The consequences are potentially very real for many patients. I am struck by research that was done after the introduction of prescription charges in 2011. Obviously, they were not popular at the time but were done for a particular reason. Professor Charles Normand in Trinity College Dublin undertook significant research to show that there was a significantly higher number of strokes and heart attacks among the population who should have been taking their medication. Due to the introduction of prescription charges, these people failed to take their proper prescriptions. I worry that people who should be getting blister packing will not pay €10, €20, €30, €40 or indeed €50 - whatever the amount the pharmacist is going to individually charge - to get the blister packing service and then we will end up in a situation where health outcomes deteriorate and not improve.",
                "The reality here is that older people and those with a disability have become pawns in a game being played out between the Department of Health and pharmacists. Phased dispensing has become a pawn in the game being played between the Minister and the IPU. That is really to be regretted. It is the antithesis of all the messaging that has been coming from the Minister and the Department over the past year as to how to improve our hospital system, prevent unnecessary hospitalisations and ultimately ensure more people are looked after at home.",
                "I will speak to where we are now. There are lines within the community pharmacy agreement that talk about a saving arising from the withdrawal of the two categories of phased dispensing. I have a question for the Minister. What has she done since the agreement was made in September to determine how that saving is to be used? Has the Department of Health done anything with pharmacists in that time? I am not hearing about anything having been done. What I am hearing is that it was wrong and not transparent of pharmacists to use phased dispensing money to provide a blister packing service. That is completely the wrong message. Many pharmacists have been doing this for the right reasons and have not been making money from the phased dispensing service. They have been doing it because they can see the impact on their patients. What is the Minister going to do in the time she has given herself to ensure appropriate measures are put in place so that any patient who needs and wants blister packing or phased dispensing, which are separate but related, can access those services? We need to do more of it in future and not less. It is really regrettable that we have to spend any time debating the matter this evening when it should never have been included in the community pharmacy agreement. We also raised it on the floor of the Chamber when we were discussing the agreement back in October."

That is the outcome we need to reach in the time ahead.",
                "At the core of this is the use of blister packs, a dosage monitoring system that helps patients manage medication safely and retain their independence, which is particularly important given our ageing population. Two weeks ago today, the Department of Health and the HSE published Delivering an Age-Friendly Health System, a blueprint intended to transform healthcare for older people. The Minister of State with responsibility for older people said that \"It sets out a clear and ambitious mission for Ireland to become a country where the entire health system is designed and delivered through an age-friendly lens that enhances the lives and well-being of all older adults.\" That is crucial. We need an age-friendly approach and that is why we need to get this right and fix the mess that has been created. The report hinges on what it calls the four Ms. One of those Ms stands for medication. According to the framework, an age-friendly health system should \"prescribe medication thoughtfully and safely\". Surely, blister packs are part of that. It is crucially important that we maintain people's independence and keep them at home for as long as possible. That is really important.",
                "Something that has not come up enough in this debate, in the media or in the Minister's contribution is the changes to phased dispensing and the impact that will have for some of the most vulnerable parts of our community. Deputy Sherlock made reference to that. The Minister has repeatedly cited the distinction between phased dispensing and monitored dosing systems, both of which were previously reimbursed under the phased dispensing arrangement. Strictly speaking, phased dispensing was introduced for patients to whom it would be unsafe to give their medication for the month on one single occasion. The rules around this are changing too but we have heard very little about it. Those changes will disproportionately impact deprived communities. That is not addressed in the motion and has not been addressed in media reports or in the Minister's statement. According to Deep End Ireland, which represents GPs in disadvantaged communities, there will be a profound and sudden narrowing of the list of medications deemed to be high-risk and, therefore, eligible for reimbursement under phased dispensing. There are very serious changes to the rules around phased dispensing as well and these need to be considered, looked at and changed.",
                "For patients who are homeless or whose living conditions are unstable, the risk of having all of their tablets dispensed at once is not confined to the pharmacology of the particular drug. The risk lies in the overall burden of managing multiple medicines when you have memory difficulties or poor health literacy, when you live a chaotic life or when you lack support. Blood thinners and insulin will no longer be deemed high-risk medications but they are high-risk for some. Why is the Minister shifting this avoidable clinical risk onto those least able to manage it? In her reply, I would really like the Minister to tease through and look at that matter because these changes are also really important and have not been given enough attention. They affect some of the most at-risk groups. It needs to be addressed.",
                "The Minister claims the changes to blister pack rules are just a correction but this decision is anything but correct. It is the wrong decision. It flies in the face of stated Government policy on ageing and delivering an age-friendly health and social care system. A constituent of mine called it a stealth tax and I would agree. We need to change this. The Minister needs to look at it. She particularly needs to look at the narrowing of the category of high-risk drugs because that will have a real impact on people."

It is particularly affecting vulnerable groups, including elderly people. Families are also really struggling. The proposal to add additional costs to blister packs shows a disconnect between this Government and the reality of people's lives. Older people, many of them living with families, are really struggling. Any additional cost could be the one that prevents them from affording food, paying rent or covering basic costs.

St. James's Hospital is a massive hospital, as I am sure the Minister is aware. It is my constituency. It services not only the people of Dublin South-Central but also people from around this country with acute care needs. It does an excellent job. What people who go into hospital want is to go home. Everybody wants to be at home, especially when they are unwell. The last place they want to be is in a hospital in unfamiliar surroundings. Therefore, to be at home really is of utmost importance and these blister packs are what allow people to be cared for in their homes for as long as that might be needed. If they cannot afford to do that, that pushes people out of the possibility of being able to stay in their home being cared for. It is just such an unnecessary cost. Of all the things the Minister could have charged people in this country for, this is the thing she chooses. I am literally flabbergasted that she would chose this. It is so mean and so unfair. The reality is that this is an important thing for people being cared for in their homes. I am getting emails from family members who are really worried about this.

We are also having the debate in the context of supposedly getting near the final furlong in the implementation of Sláintecare, a public health system, and we are nowhere near that, unfortunately.",
                "The importance of blister packs and the importance of having monitored dosage systems cannot be overstated. The health and safety of patients is paramount. The withdrawal of this is dangerous and I do not say that lightly. For people with complex medical needs and multiple conditions, this very basic service was provided free of charge. I heard the Minister's interview on Sunday and I know she explained how it is being funded. I get that but we are dealing with people who have multiple medical needs and who are taking multiple medications. I have seen the medications on the kitchen table in households. They are taking two of this a day, four of that and one of those. They could have seven or eight different types of medication. It is very hard for them to keep track of this and this is a simple way of doing it. The majority of them are pensioners, disabled people, or people on very low incomes. We are talking about the most vulnerable. The blister packs are simple and it is a safe way of ensuring people are taking the correct dosage at the right time at the correct time of the day and everything else. Older people, including people with a range of medical conditions, rely on them - as I said, those who have complex medical needs. Chemists can charge between €30 and €50 for them but this is on top of other medical costs. The decision by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, and the Minister, to withdraw this now is putting an extra burden on these low-income households and individuals and it is coming at the worst time of the year. The majority of those who are typically dependent on the packs, which as the Minister said on Sunday - and fair enough - are being funded through what is called a phased dispensing reimbursement scheme, are on low incomes. This is coming on top of increasing food and energy costs. There was another announcement of an energy increase today. These are all increasing. Wait until the bills start coming in January. We have not even hit Christmas yet. This comes on top of the high cost of living. The increases are happening right across the board and it will disproportionately hit the poor the hardest. What must also be factored into this is the low income thresholds for medical cards. If you are under 66, the income threshold for a single person is €184. The last time I remember that being increased was back at the start of the noughties, around 2002 or 2003. I am open to correction but it was well over 20 years ago. If you are over 66, it is €201. When you hit that, you are gone. You cannot get a full medical card. For a couple under 66, the income threshold is €201. A couple over 66 - between that and 70 - it is €298. I am imploring the Minister and the Minister of State here to address this.",
                "What has also increased in the past 14 or 15 years is the number of items and medications no longer covered by the medical card scheme. Every TD will have heard this over the past 14 or 15 years. People come to us saying that such and such a thing they used to get on a medical card is no longer there as it was withdrawn. A third thing that has come into play in the past 14 years is GPs charging for blood tests. I raised this with James Reilly, Leo Varadkar and every Minister for Health since. That used to be free for people with medical cards but what happened was that the GPs started charging for it. They say they do not have to do it, according to their contracts. However, the Fine Gael Government, which the Minister was not part of at the time, negotiated a new contract with the GPs and this was not addressed in it, despite the fact it was pointed out on the floor of the Dáil to Leo Varadkar, James Reilly and others. I remember standing here in this same spot pointing it out to them, as did others at the time. I had pensioners coming to me about it at the time. That needs to be sorted out.",
                "There is all of that. There is the low income threshold, increasing medical card costs, the number of substances not covered and then GPs charging medical card patients for blood tests. When the Government negotiated the agreement with the pharmacies this year, this was not included. The State always paid for the phased dispensing and that was used as a safer way for different people. Some pharmacies were using it to cover the costs, and that is fair enough. There are two ways to resolve this. One is to allow the pharmacies to cover the costs under the existing scheme, what is called a phased dispensing scheme. The other is to pay the pharmacies a modest fee to dispense this using the monitored dosage system and the blister packs. There has been a giveaway budget for the big hotels, McDonald's and Costa. They got nearly €1 billion. The tiny amount of money that would fix this was not thought of. This needs to be fixed. We are nearly on the eve of Christmas. I ask the Minister to do one good thing for Christmas. I ask her to sort this out, cover the cost of the blister packs and keep our patients, elderly and vulnerable people, safe."

Whatever the ins and outs of this issue, the Minister and her Government are now placing the individual patients as pawns between the Department, the Government and the pharmacies. The buck stops with the Minister. I am asking that the Minister does the right thing, the compassionate thing and stops any question of charging for blister packs either now or into the future.",
                "This issue reminds me of the blood test charge debacle. First, GPs started charging medical cardholders for the taking of bloods. After being told it was illegal, we were then told it was not so illegal and would be covered under the contract. Political football was played with the issue for years and the outcome was that every medical cardholder now pays for blood tests. In my home town of Clonmel, patients pay anything from €10 to €30 for a blood test, regardless of whether they have a medical card.",
                "That should not happen in this case but I am very much afraid that the attitude of the Department and the Minister means it might well happen. I am putting them on notice tonight that the blister pack issue must be dealt with now and any charge to patients in this regard should be ruled out completely. Anything short of that will show again that the Government is out of touch with the public. The whole question of the cost of living arises with this issue. The very people it is proposed to charge for the blister packs, namely, the elderly, the vulnerable, the sick and the disabled, are already being hammered by increased costs.",
                "Unfortunately, the Government made a choice in that regard in the budget when it supported developers, burger barons and landlords and failed to support the vulnerable people in society who needed energy credits and supports and who have already been hit by huge energy cost increases. Almost all the major energy companies, all of which are making obscene profits, have increased their charges in recent months. Department officials recommended to the Government that there be energy credits in the budget, noting that, without them, the average family will pay an additional €321 per year. The Government took no notice of that. Vulnerable people were not the choice. The Government chose the developers, landlords and burger barons.",
                "The budget was framed on the basis of a 2% inflation rate but a recent survey shows the rate is at 3.2%. The former Minister based his budget on a rate of 2% before taking off to the World Bank. We now have a situation where people who were already under pressure are being hit with an inflation rate 50% higher than was budgeted for in a context where not a single energy credit was put in place. Food costs are also hammering all the people who may be subject to a blister pack charge. The same survey recently showed that food prices are up by 6%. Over the past few years, the average family paid an additional €3,000 per year in food costs.",
                "People who are vulnerable, including the disabled, the ill and the elderly, are now facing the prospect of an additional charge. I ask the Minister of State to rule this charge out for once and for all. I am asking that it not be deferred for two months, six months or whatever but ruled out now and for good. If that is not done, I would be very much afraid the Government will go down the same road as its predecessor in regard to blood test charges and we will end up with blister pack charges of €10, €20, €30, €40 or €50 per month. I ask the Minister of State to do the right and compassionate thing by ruling out these charges, full stop."

In the UK, the Labour Party Government brought in cuts in funeral cost supports and there was an absolute outcry. Elderly people in the UK are absolutely disgusted their Government did that. What the Government here is doing with blister pack charges is shocking. It is attacking the most vulnerable in society, namely, the elderly, the disabled and the sick. The Government knows that is whom it is attacking. It is why it is slipping in a kind of underhanded charge.",
                "I thank Sinn Féin for bringing forward this motion. In fairness, it calls a spade a spade. The blister packs we are talking about cost anything from €20 to €50 and even more for complex medications. The charges will affect people with dementia and their carers and people with Parkinson's disease. Taking their medication on time every time is very important for those patients. This really is an attack on the elderly.",
                "People are facing a range of little charges, including prescription charges and GP blood test charges. Elderly people are telling me they cannot get to see a chiropodist. A gentleman who came to my clinic in Clonakilty the other day said he is finding it very difficult to get a chiropodist appointment. All these hidden withdrawals of services and hidden charges are attacks on people. The most annoying thing is that we have a pharmacy union that is putting up with this nonsense from the Government. The Minister announced free HRT medication for women and then threw it to the pharmacies to clean up the dirty mess. She had to clean it up herself in the end but that situation should never have arisen. In this case, once again, the pharmacy union should be not in that situation. Pharmacists are being dragged here and there having to explain to the people to whom they have been so good and caring down through the years that this is a cost outside their control.",
                "Blister packs are not a luxury but the Government seems to think people only want them because they are a cool thing to have. In fact, they might be the difference as to whether a patient with dementia or a very serious illness can control their medication every day without missing it and then collapsing and having to go into hospital, which ends up being a terrible cost to the State and their family. I do not understand where this is coming from. By saying it is deferring the charges and kicking the can down the road to March or April, does that mean the Government will bring forward this proposed charge again? It has been resoundingly rejected by the public and the majority of the political system in this House. The Government needs to be very clear on what will happen. Every TD I have heard speaking has said that. The Government must make up its mind. Is it going ahead with this? It must tell the truth and stop codding people.",
                "This is an outrageous attack on elderly people. I know of a lady who cares for her 82-year-old mother who has Alzheimer's disease. A blister pack charge means she is facing extra costs of up to €40 a month that she cannot afford. Where will this money come from? There are extra costs across the board and nothing for people in the budget other than €10 for pensioners and people on disabilities. A lot of people have lost €1,400 in disability supports this year, which is an astonishing attack on them. There is time for the Government to wake up and act."

I accept all of that. However, what she has told the House is an indictment of the Government. It knew this was happening back in September, when it went into negotiations with the pharmacy union. The Government knew the issues with blister pack charges. We are all TDs and we are all dealing with constituents day in and day out. I defy anyone in this House to say it was not known how blister packs were being distributed. The Government decided to go back into negotiations, get this done and save itself a couple of bob. My God, it could find €125 million for Ukraine the other day, just like that and no problem whatsoever, but it cannot find the money to support people with medications.",

If we ask people in the ambulance service, they will say that when they go into somebody's house and that person is unconscious, they will check the blister packs to see what medication the person is taking. They can make the right decisions on that basis. Blister packs are essential for those who want to live independently in their home. They are essential for the carers who look after people.",

The Minister is making another mistake by getting rid of this. It is an absolute disgrace. The excuse coming from the senior Minister was cold and harsh and did not give a damn. She does not give a tuppenny curse for what is going on with the people of this State. They do not give a damn about it. The proof of that is the empty Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael benches today."

Many often end up going back into hospital because they cannot manage their medication. Their home help cannot assist them with it. They present back to the pharmacy, the GP and go into hospital when the medication is not provided to them in a blister pack. Blister packs reduce errors and prevent readmission to hospital.",
                "The cost to the pharmacy is enormous. On average, it takes about one hour to prepare a blister pack. They have to be clinically checked first, over and back with the GP, and an assembly process then takes place, usually by a technician, and finally then it is verified by a pharmacist. It costs in the region of €70 per hour. This is a loss-making exercise for pharmacists. That is what is happening. They are doing it for the benefit of their patients because they have an obligation to them. The Minister is disregarding dementia patients. She has money for the Ukrainian situation and for the 32,000 NGOs in the country, but the most vulnerable people in the State, the people who have built this society - the roads and infrastructure in this country - are being disregarded.",

That is not the reality. I have been speaking to pharmacists across Mayo who are telling me this cannot continue. They cannot continue this loss-making exercise, particularly with regard to the changes that are set to be introduced. I want that to go back to the Minister. Many patients with dementia will be put in significant jeopardy if these changes go ahead.",

Pharmacists in Mayo and across the country are trying to do their best for patients. They are trying to use the available schemes to get their patients a blister pack. They are doing that for the safety of their patients. Pharmacists are still operating at a loss in this regard. The Minister is asking patients to report their pharmacists to the regulator. Goodwill should be recognised here. It should be recognised that pharmacists are doing their best for patients while operating at a loss. This is the respect the Government has for them in relation to this service.",

                "The Minister has had to leave. I missed the opening part of the debate but I hope to clarify some pieces of misinformation that in the media that have been bandied about in the Chamber this evening. The role of a pharmacist and their team, including pharmacy technicians, is a very professional one of safeguarding and ensuring that the right patient gets the right medicine at the right time. Over the years, the delivery of complex medicines has increased, as has the complexity of ensuring that the right patient gets the right medicine. Initially, pharmacists offered an opt-in for an optional blister packing service. Then it became slightly more formal with the recognition of phased dispensing. That could be requested by a GP. In 2017, the HSE PRCS decided to take a more in-depth look because the fees for the phased dispensing service were increasing. They were up around €68 million per annum at that stage. They dropped back to between €53 million and €54 million, on average, in 2022-23 and €58 million per annum in 2024.",
                "There are effectively three systems in place. The first is phasing without a blister pack, which is requested by a GP or a consultant. If a pharmacist recognises that a patient is having difficulty with his or her medicines, they can advise the family, the carer or the public health nurse to have word with the GP or to request a consultation. There may or may not be blister packing. Then there is a blister packing service that has been provided for nothing by many of my colleagues. There is a charge of around €12, on average, by others. Then we jump to €50 and the fearmongering around that.",
                "The one thing we have learned from today is that we need to make sure that the proper information is out there and that we deliver it. We do not want to frighten people either. We are all very mindful of people who are very vulnerable and that will definitely be considered. I have no doubt about that.",
                "Concerned members of the public and their families and carers should realise that their local community pharmacist is the expert in their medication. They have the expertise and they are so approachable when someone wants information or advice. In line with the pharmacy contract, the regulatory framework and the service provided by pharmacists and pharmacies can assist patients through counselling, reminder charts, the Know Check Ask system with the HSE and tools like pictures or large-print labels and alarms so there are ways to help. All of these are aimed at improving understanding of the medication. There are lots of ways that pharmacists can help patients. It does not always come down to the blister packs. International evidence will show that blister packaging to maintain compliance is always supported so we need to look at the evidence as well. That is something we will be addressing, along with how we all work together. All of us here want to help the most vulnerable in our community - the people who need these supports - and that is what we are here to do.",
                "There is very good evidence relating to true community pharmacy intervention, including patient counselling when a new medicine is prescribed or for high-risk medicines or when prescriptions are changed or just discharged from hospital medicines, so that the pharmacist can really support people to understand and use their medicines appropriately. We understand the role of the pharmacist and the pharmacies and the work they do. It is important to highlight that tonight.",
                "Phased dispensing is not being withdrawn by the community pharmacy agreement but there will be improvement controls around phased dispensing in order to put patient safety first and to allow the State to look at the funding to be used to implement new patient-centric services. Phased dispensing and the supply of medicines in monitored dosage systems are separate and distinct with one being State supported and the latter being a private service.",
                "In her statement on 12 December, the Minister noted that community pharmacies are under pressure at the moment with an earlier than expected start of the flu season. At the moment, we see all these incidences of flu. They are also delivering vaccinations and preparing to establish the new common conditions service. I know the Minister has been working extremely hard on this. The Minister agrees that the IPU needed to engage further with its membership to clarify what the community pharmacists had to do on further work with their patients, especially the most vulnerable, to clarify these supports. It is all about getting information out there. It is important that when a pharmacy charges a fee for any professional service, it provides updated information to patients in line with the new pricing transparency guideline, which came into effect on 1 December. I want to reassure the House that the Department, the HSE and the IPU will continue to engage, including on two new collaborative structures to support any clarifications required, and, importantly, to ensure the success of the new pharmacy agreement. Older persons counselling, Age Friendly Ireland and carers were mentioned. It is important that everybody works together and no misinformation is given. I thank the Deputies. It is a really important issue and it is important that we have these few months and that the proper information is given."

It is not because Sinn Féin warned the Government in October about the difficulties that this would cause patients both in terms of costs and health outcomes. In fact, the Government ignored us back then. The reason the Government has postponed this is because it has been taken aback by just how upset the public is over this move, particularly our older citizens.",

The fact that people were getting these increases during one of the worst cost-of-living crises is cruel. It was being delivered to people in the depths of winter but that is only one part of the issue. For people who have dementia, brain injuries or mental health issues, or those who simply have to take a large amount of medication, blister packs ensure they do not overdose or miss their doses. The outcome of either of these things can be very serious for a person's health. It can also put extra strain on the health service. For carers and families, blister packs provide reassurance that their loved ones are on top of their medication while allowing them to maintain their sense of independence and manage their healthcare in their own home. If the Minister had addressed the concerns raised by Deputy Cullinane, we would not be in this mess. Why did she not take the advice given in October and prevent us from being here?"

We have all come across people who have been in that situation. I came across a case recently of a 94-year-old woman, where we did not know whether she had taken a double dose. The woman was distraught and upset and her family felt even worse. She ended up in hospital the next day. When one is caring for a loved one with dementia or other conditions that can cause cognitive or mobility issues, blister packs are not an optional extra but a necessity. Blister packs without subsidisation can cost an individual in the range of €20 to €40 a month. This is what people are telling us. The Minister asks where we are coming up with that number. These figures are coming to us from people. I do not know how much it is going to cost and clearly the Minister does not know, which is a problem for her and the Government.",

The decision at the weekend is for a pause only. It goes back to the question of why this was not sorted out in negotiations with the IPU. That is the big question everyone is asking here tonight. The Department of Health is famous for announcing that it is going to go ahead with something and that it has the agreement of doctors. Doctors might not know about it but the Department announces it in the media. Clearly, this situation seems to be the same. This was something the Government just pushed. It did not think it was an issue and now ordinary people will be left with the problem."

Over the weekend, amid the confusion and chaos, many people got in touch with me to tell me how this was going to affect them or their loved one. Vulnerable users of the blister packs such as older people managing multiple medications, people living with early-stage dementia or Alzheimer’s disease or people with arthritis find blister packs really handy. This will directly affect their health and safety. One woman in north Kildare named Maureen told me that her daughter has cerebral palsy and lives independently with 24-hour support. Maureen used to organise her daughter's medication in the little pill boxes for many years but now the home care provider has mandated that staff can only use medication from blister packs. This leaves her daughter worried that she might have to stop her medication, give up independent living and move into a nursing home, which would be a lot more expensive with her already inadequate disability allowance.",

I was a community first responder. It is really handy, if you are attending somebody's house, that the first thing you can check is their blister pack. You will then have a fair idea of what medication they are on. It is a false economy to withdraw this."

However, kicking it down the road is not a solution to a problem of its own creation. It is outrageous that the Government wants to put a charge on such packs. It is also outrageous that even those holding medical cards will be liable to pay the charge. Who are the people who will be most affected by such a charge? They will be the people who will benefit most from having their medication dispensed from blister packs, such as elderly patients and those with memory-related difficulties like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease. It will also impact individuals who have complex medication regimes, for example, cancer patients, who realistically can have a dozen or more tablets to take for anything up to three times a day. Blister packs are especially useful for caregivers who can check whether the medication required by those they are caring for is taken in a timely manner.",

This stress and anxiety are not alleviated by the Government deferring the payment until later in 2026. It cannot have this hanging over the heads of some of the most vulnerable in our community. The Government should do the decent thing and reverse this proposal, which has proved itself as popular as the infamous proposal to tax children's shoes by a previous Fine Gael Government in 1982."

That was what was missing - that human empathy where very vulnerable patients are now being told they are going to have to pay.

It is not unreasonable to ask a Government, in circumstances where vulnerable patients are now being left high and dry, to do its job. As was said, the Government knew when it negotiated this agreement and, as it saw it, tightened up on the rules in relation to phased dispensing, that this was going to happen. I knew it was going to happen. I warned the Government, it did not listen and now we have very upset, vulnerable patients who have been left high and dry. It is simply not good enough.

                    "I propose to take Questions Nos. 85, 86 and 85 together.",
                    "I thank the Deputies for their questions. As this is my first parliamentary question session as Minister for Defence, I look forward to working with them constructively at what we know is an important time in the world, particularly for Ireland's position on a range of defence matters. As Minister, I am committed to the ongoing transformation and modernisation of Óglaigh na hÉireann across land, air, sea and cyber domains. It is essential that we continuously strengthen our defence capabilities in light of what is a changed geopolitical landscape since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, in particular.",
                    "As the Deputy said, a widely reported incident occurred on Monday, 1 December, regarding drones operating in the vicinity of a Naval Service vessel in the Irish Sea. Notwithstanding some suggestions, I will be clear that at no stage was the flight of President Zelenskyy compromised and the security operation, led by An Garda Síochána supported by the Defence Forces, was successfully deployed through multiple means, ultimately leading to a safe and successful visit to Ireland by President Zelenskyy, the first lady and their team. All of the circumstances, as you would expect after something like this, regarding the drone incident have been and are being investigated and analysed by the Defence Forces and An Garda Síochána. At all times, the Irish Naval Service vessel operated within standard operating procedures, rules of engagement and the law of the sea and could have exercised the right to self-defence if it considered itself under threat. This is obviously a decision that has to be taken by those who are trained and who are dealing with the potential response.",
                    "In the circumstances, the Deputies will appreciate that it is not appropriate for me to comment further on operational decisions, particularly in relation to deployment of military capabilities. As Minister, I will prioritise the delivery of counter unmanned aerial systems capabilities for use by the Defence Forces - in other words, counter drone technology, which is an urgent operational priority. I can confirm that procurement of same is well advanced. Today at Cabinet, I brought forward a memo bringing forward such capabilities. We have approved the preliminary business case.",
                    "I have said clearly that we will now be partnering with France, although a number of other countries have engaged with us on this. The next stage is to engage in extensive and further detail with France. I will bring forward a further business case in the new year. On top of that, we will bring forward early next year the counter radar system, which will be up and running and in place before the EU Presidency next year.",
                    "One of my key priorities as Minister for Defence is to ensure that the operational capacity of the Defence Forces is maintained and developed in line with the Government’s decision to move to level 2 ambition as defined by the Commission on the Defence Forces. The Commission on the Defence Forces recommended the development of a primary radar capability to ensure that Ireland can maintain a complete recognised air picture. As I said, I brought this to Government this morning. A project team comprising senior civil and military personnel is continuing to progress the radar programme. This programme of work is ongoing and good progress has been made. When fully delivered, the recognised air picture will incorporate this suite of military radar systems. It will have the capability to detect all aircraft traversing our airspace, including any that may be operating with their transponders turned off. Full delivery of the programme will be complex. The timeline at the moment is out to 2028 but I have brought forward the counter drone elements of it, which will be procured and in place next year before the EU Presidency. As announced today the programme is moving to the next stages. We look forward to working with the Government and with France to make sure we have that in place as soon as possible.",
                    "I assure Deputies that the Defence Forces are working closely with An Garda Síochána in response to these potential incidents we are seeing happening quite frequently across the EU. In the past couple of weeks I have regularly sat with colleagues across the European Council. We hear from colleagues in Lithuania that they are having significant hybrid threats with balloons in airspace. We have seen in Poland where explosions have literally taken trains off tracks. If it were not for some not exploding, there could have been significant loss of life. We are seeing other countries like Denmark and elsewhere where these types of threats are occurring more regularly. We have to be live to the fact that we are not immune to this. That is exactly why we are investing in the radar system, in particular. It is exactly why a significant proportion of the €1.7 billion of our capital plan announced last week will be invested in our radar system. That is why we are bringing forward the counter drone technology to be in place before the EU Presidency next year. That is why we are doing everything to make sure that where we can put in place new measures that they are done as soon as possible."

The neglect of the Defence Forces by the past three Governments, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil in their various turns, has created a threat to our national security. The Minister spoke about bringing forward the radar picture, the anti-drone system and counter unmanned air system capabilities. That was due to be delivered in the autumn - quarter 3 of 2025. It is in the Commission on the Defence Forces. She is not bringing it forward. It is already late. In that context, it is a concern to me as to whether it will be in place before the EU Presidency. Realistically, it needs to be in place now. It is a huge concern that in the past there has been excellent co-operation between An Garda and the Defence Forces but to see both organisations briefing against each other raises significant concerns about the strength of the protocols that exist. We are not going to get into operational matters, because it would not be appropriate, but we clearly need to see protocols tighten up if there is a conflict in approach."

Was air traffic control in Dublin Airport made aware in real time, or as close to real time, of the incident, and if not, why not? When was it made aware and what protocols underpin engagement with air traffic control in Dublin? Are there plans to release some form of footage relating to this to counter false narratives out there up to and including people doubting whether this actually happened? I, for one, believe it happened and believe this is a threat. However, I have concerns that without footage being released in some fashion that those false narratives could take hold and undermine us moving towards a more credible security strategy."

Such incidences highlight the real and present risk posed by drones during the high-profile visit. We can expect activity like this to persist when Ireland takes over the EU Presidency next year, as our counterparts in Denmark experienced during their Presidency. I raised this matter with the Taoiseach last week during Taoiseach's questions. In his response he advised that Ireland is developing radar capacity and that we are procuring equipment, that the Garda special detective unit is carrying out an investigation of the circumstances of the incident, and that we have already enhanced our anti-drone capabilities. Will the Minister advise what stage the procurement process is at, and when will the radar be delivered? Is there a date for that and when it will become operational? Will she also provide any updates on the Garda investigation into the sightings, and advise what threat assessments are carried out and will be carried out during the visits of international dignitaries?"

I repeat that at no stage did they compromise the security operation that was in place for President Zelenskyy's visit. I will say that we are taking this matter extremely seriously. That is why there is a review under way. That is why the Garda is conducting a review working with the Defence Forces. Of course, if lessons need to be learned about how different information was communicated and whether or not appropriate steps were taken. My understanding is that all appropriate steps were taken and all proper controls were followed. However, we need to make sure we can learn from any type of scenario like this because we are all aware that these types of incidents are not once-off. We are seeing them happen more regularly and that is why we are taking them seriously. It is also important to stress that this was a successful visit. We did not close down airspace. There was not any issue in terms of the plane or visit itself.",

I certainly have confidence but again, there is more we need to do.",

They are in constant engagement and that will continue, if not increase, in the run-up to the Presidency to make sure in our security operations, which will be led by An Garda Síochána, they are working closely together and that other agency, whether it is air navigation or anybody else on the ground, that need to be involved in part of the overall security operation is involved in that too.",

In parallel with this, training will take place within the Defence Forces to make sure we have members that are able to use it. Of course, the Presidency will start in the beginning of July and I appreciate timelines may have changed but I am saying very clearly I will be signing a contract before the end of the year. We will have this capacity before the second half of next year and we will have it in place and operational before the Presidency starts.",

It is attended by members from An Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces and the relevant Ministers and Members. This is a space separate to the work ongoing between the gardaí and the Defence Forces to make sure the preparations, plans and security measures that need to be put in place are in place and are operational for next year."

It will be purchased within the first half of the year but that is not a lot of time for the personnel to get used to this and ensure protocols are in place and so on. What struck me most was clearly the visit of President Zelenskyy was very welcome and worthwhile but the Minister has talked about it proving the radar system worked. These drones were 400 m or 500 m away from the naval vessels. They could be seen with the naked eye, so it does not prove anything on that or tell us anything about our radar capacity. I note the report last weekend by Conor Gallagher in The Irish Times made the point the LÉ William Butler Yeats did not have radar-guided weapons in the way the previous flagship, LÉ Eithne, had and it was therefore constrained in its ability.",

In that regard, as I mentioned previously, I announced a substantial investment of €1.7 billion in the Defence Forces over the next four years. It is not just about technology and equipment or new naval vessels. There is an investment specifically in the men and women and the equipment they use on a day-to-day basis.

Australia took a sensible approach. Officials evaluated the situation trhough the study of health outcomes for aircraft maintenance personnel and they offered health supports. That is key to what we do on this. That is the kind of approach that makes sense - evaluate the situation, try to identify the connections between the exposure and health impacts, provide healthcare solutions and find out how it came to pass. This has been examined on a number of occasions in the past, although not all of this is in the public domain.

Figures provided by the Defence Forces for the year to date are encouraging. A total of 156 inductions to the Naval Service has been achieved as of 31 October. This represents an increase of 59 more than the total of 97 inductions achieved for all of 2024. In addition, applications for the Naval Service have grown substantially this year with the total number of applications received as of 31 October being 2,591, which is 31% higher than the total received for all of last year. Application numbers for direct entry specialist competitions are positive, and have resulted in growth in specialist recruitment. As of 31 October there have been 19 direct entry inductions into specialist roles in the Naval Service. This is the highest annual total recorded since the commencement of this specific direct entry recruitment for the Naval Service in 2019. I will come back later with further information."

The Naval Service such as it is today requires people with very high skills. Many of them gain these skills within the Naval Service, but we have had the embarrassing situation in the past 12 months that a navy ship was put to sea without a functioning main gun. The reason for that is the Naval Service did not have the specialist staff required, namely, artificers. There are also issues with marine engineering officers, because there is a significant outflow of them. We have seen a situation with the 63rd Naval cadet class where six cadets commenced training but only two were commissioned. There remaining four withdrew before being commissioned, referencing the extended service commitment associated with naval officer training as the primary reason for their departure. This is after considerable investment by the State and therefore, the loss of those personnel. Therefore, we need to be looking at commitment service schemes."

What is most concerning about that article is the documents that were provided to The Currency under freedom of information, which were quite clearly in the possession of the IFI and known by persons who were in the room here last Thursday. It was self-evident last Thursday that we were not being given full and frank answers to some very basic questions we asked about who knew what and when in relation to a very serious allegation that a prosecutorial agency of this State knowingly provided false information to An Garda Síochána. It was very clear we were not being given full and frank answers. We looked for a series of documents at the last meeting, which are also in the possession of the IFI. I know we are going to follow up in relation to that. Those documents should be given to us immediately or as quickly as can be done. The IFI has already handed over documents to a news publication. We discussed in an earlier session that this is something the committee must inquire into again and that we must have the IFI back before the committee. I am extremely conscious that there is a live process going on in relation to the new CEO of the IFI. It is important that we put a line under issues that have been going on for more than four or five years. This is the forum in which to do so."

Following last week's engagement with the IFI, I am on record as saying it was one of the more difficult engagements that I have had in my tenure as a member of this committee. The drip-feeding of information at that meeting last week was deeply concerning. What is even more concerning is the information that has come out in the publication, The Currency, this morning, in the article by Niall Sargent, which was alluded to by Deputy Geoghegan. The information contradicts a lot of the testimony that was given to us last week and calls into question timelines and who knew what when. It is deeply concerning.",

That information had only been signed off in the days in advance of our engagement with IFI last week. That information was fresh in the minds of a number of our witnesses. To my mind, there is no reason inaccurate information should have been given, or was given, to us at the public accounts committee. It is my intention, with the agreement of members, that we bring IFI back in the new year. It is critical that the information we have requested, and the documentation, correspondence and reports we have requested and will request of IFI, are made available to us as soon as possible. We are finalising a comprehensive list of documents and files that we will require and it is critical that we get this information as soon as possible.",

It is my intention to write to the Department and the Secretary General to outline the work we are embarked on and the concerns we have in relation to the governance within Inland Fisheries Ireland and not just over the past year. IFI has come before the Committee of Public Accounts over the past number of years and it is deeply concerning that, unfortunately, there is a continuation of serious issues that have been identified going back as far as 2020, and this is deeply concerning. I will correspond with the Department expressing our frustration and concerns and to get an update on the process. There is a role for the Minister in signing off the appointment of the incoming chief executive. We will seek an update on this. It is deeply concerning and it is an issue in which we have a keen and deep interest here in the public accounts committee."

Corporation tax receipts comprised the largest receipts stream in 2024, boosted by the receipt of €10.9 billion as part of the winding down of the Apple escrow account following the judgment by the Court of Justice of the European Union that Ireland had in the past granted the Apple Group unlawful state aid in how its tax affairs were dealt with.",

Pay-related social insurance contributions and VAT one-stop-shop scheme receipts together account for the majority of non-Exchequer receipts. I issued a clear audit opinion in relation to the Revenue account.",

Taking account of appropriations-in-aid of €64.7 million, net expenditure amounted to €516 million. At the end of 2024, there was a surplus of €15.8 million for surrender to the Exchequer.",
                "I issued a clear audit opinion in relation to the appropriation account. However, I drew attention to non-compliance with procurement rules and to a payment redirection fraud that occurred in 2024, disclosed by the Accounting Officer in the statement on internal financial control. The payment of €343,000 made by Revenue was recovered in full, and steps have been taken to tighten payment controls.",
                "In addition to auditing the Revenue account and Vote 9, I have a specific remit to examine and report on whether the systems and controls in place are adequate to secure an effective check on the assessment, collection and proper allocation of the revenues of the State, and to ascertain whether the way they are employed and deployed is adequate. Chapter 18 examines Revenue’s approach to the assessment and collection of carbon taxes and assesses more broadly whether the increases in carbon tax receipts since 2020 have been allocated and spent on the targeted schemes and programmes. The stated aim was that the increased receipts would be used to fund expenditure including that related to just transition schemes, retrofitting and sustainable farming. We found that between 2020 and 2023, €1.36 billion in increased carbon tax revenue was allocated by the Department of Public Expenditure to specified expenditure programmes across five departmental Votes. However, because the expenditure was less than the amounts provided and had to be surrendered, or because funding was mixed in with other core funding, only 61% of the sum allocated could be verified as having been spent on additional carbon tax measures.",
                "Chapter 19 examines Revenue’s systems and procedures for assessing and collecting the sugar tax introduced in 2018, along with its approach to identifying and tackling possible non-compliance. Net receipts totalled €172 million between 2018 and 2023, with annual net receipts decreasing from €33 million in 2019 to €29 million in 2023. The extent to which the decline in receipts was due to either product reformulation by manufacturers or changes in consumption patterns is difficult to determine. Between 2018 and 2023, Revenue carried out 126 compliance interventions for the sugar tax, yielding a total of €426,000. The report made two recommendations around the approval process for sugar tax repayment claims, and both were accepted by Revenue.",
                "Chapter 20 reviews Revenue’s approach to monitoring and managing taxpayer compliance, focusing on the measures Revenue has in place to assess, detect and deter non-compliance. Unlike in some other jurisdictions, there is no official estimate of the level of tax evasion in Ireland. We noted that the numbers of risk-based audits, investigations and non-audit interventions carried out annually by Revenue have been steadily declining since 2016. However, the additional tax yield from that activity has remained relatively stable year on year, indicating that detection work is generally well targeted.",
                "Chapter 21 reviews the circumstances around the settlement reached with a retailer that was considerably less than the original assessed liability in respect of the plastic bag levy. In 2009, following an audit of a retailer, Revenue issued notices of assessment for an aggregate outstanding amount of €36.6 million in respect of plastic bag levies due for the period 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2008. The retailer appealed Revenue’s assessment of liability and commenced legal proceedings, which extended over many years. In preparation for the appeal hearing in 2021, Revenue reviewed the calculations supporting its November 2009 notices of assessment and identified a number of issues. On the basis of that review, Revenue reduced the estimated liability to €8.5 million, which was less than one quarter of the original demand. This assessment was confirmed by the Tax Appeals Commission in September 2023. Having consulted the Department of Climate, Energy and the Environment, Revenue subsequently accepted a settlement offer of €5 million from the retailer, which was 59% of the assessed liability.",
                "Chapter 22 reviews the key trends in taxable rental income over a six-year period, from 2017 to 2022, and considers the systems and procedures Revenue has in place to facilitate the assessment and timely collection of tax on rental income. In 2022, gross domestic rental income declared was around €8 billion, comprising €4.8 billion declared by individuals and €3.2 billion declared by companies. Most rental income declared by companies relates to commercial properties, while individuals primarily declared rental income from residential properties. Companies appear to be able to use deductible expenses, capital allowances and losses to reduce their overall taxable rental income more effectively than individual owners of rental property.",
                "Revenue’s primary focus is on taxpayers and their compliance with applicable tax law rather than on the impact of taxation on economic sectors, and this is reflected in the way it gathers information from taxpayers. Because the property rental market is such a critical issue in current public discourse, I see considerable potential merit in better understanding its structures and operations. The report recommended that Revenue should consider publishing rental income statistics for companies, and this has been accepted by Revenue. The report also recommended that Revenue consider amending its taxpayer returns to include details of individual rental properties, including, for example, a unique property identifier such as the eircode. The final recommendation proposed that Revenue should also consider requiring caseworkers to record the yield from compliance activity by source – for example, rental income – and to collate this data. These two recommendations have not been accepted by Revenue for reasons set out in the report."

It is the responsibility of those in receipt of rental income, in line with the principles of self-assessment, to ensure that the rental income is reported to Revenue in their annual tax return. As outlined in the chapter, across the years 2017 to 2023, Revenue carried out just over 21,000 compliance interventions on taxpayers who operated in the rental sector. The total yield from these interventions was just over €230 million. In 2024 and the year 2025 to date, Revenue carried out a further 2,500 compliance interventions with an associated yield of €43.1 million. The chapter makes three recommendations, one of which was agreed. Of the recommendations not agreed, the first relates to broader policy matters that fall outside Revenue's remit, while the second relates to the recording of yield from compliance activity under the specific income stream giving rise to the yield. I am satisfied that the current approach to recording compliance intervention outcomes adequately supports effective reporting of the compliance activities and aligns with the basis on which tax liabilities are calculated.",
                "The committee has also expressed an interest in matters relating to the MV Matthew. Following on from my correspondence with the committee on this matter in September 2025, the advance briefing provided for today's meeting includes up-to-date information and cost figures reflecting the current position in relation to the MV Matthew. I assure the committee that the disposal of this vessel is a key priority for Revenue and I am happy to discuss this matter further at today's meeting.",
                "To conclude, I wish to take this opportunity to thank all Revenue staff for their professionalism, dedication and commitment. I again draw the committee's attention to section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and my obligation to uphold taxpayers' confidentiality. Subject to this constraint, I am happy to answer the committee's questions."

This was the largest seizure of cocaine ever in the country and one of the largest ever in Europe. The seizure of the vessel was unprecedented. This vessel was bought by an international crime gang to import a consignment of drugs, and 2,500 kg is a lot of cocaine.

We have seen the success of the Criminal Assets Bureau. It is important that we take out the product and the societal impact of the product on the country and the expenses of the country. An academic research paper from 2000 stated that in one year, class A drugs in the UK, including Wales, had a societal cost of €13 billion. Cocaine to a value of €157 million, had it come onto the market in Ireland, would have had an impact on justice, criminality, education, absenteeism and child protection. There is a huge societal cost so it is important that we attack those who bring it in where it hurts most, which is in their pockets."

When Covid happened in March 2020, we suspended all enforcement action. The debt warehouse came in legally in July 2020 and that ran until May 2022. Essentially, normal debt management and enforcement stopped for that entire period. Obviously, as we came out of public health restrictions, May 2022 to probably 2023 was focused on the unwinding of the debt warehousing system. In 2024, we started to reboot the debt management system and that is fully operational now. What happened over 2023, 2024 and into 2025 was a slippage in timely compliance. That was the overhang of the restrictions. Our aim now is to get back to where we would like to be, where people pay tax as it falls due. There is a significant impact. I was reading last week a report on our activity this year through the debt management system and the expectation is that it has led to an additional €109 billion to date this year in recovering debt that was late and not paid.

I am wondering what its rationale was and how it differs from the previous letter-of-no-audit system. People listening to these proceedings should note that when you die, there is an audit pretty much on your life. It would have been done previously, especially when it came to overseas beneficiaries, but we are seeing a lot more focus on it now by Revenue. I wonder why, even though Revenue was always entitled to do it. For executors administering loved one’s estates, maybe themselves or through accountants or solicitors, it is causing some angst. The system is quite onerous and it seems it could be simpler. So much of what is done in Revenue is so simple, straightforward and really clear. It is ahead of many other organisations when it comes to IT. I am just wondering, with regard to what is like the last piece in the probate picture, whether something could be done to simplify things for the public."

To go back a bit, a number of years ago we moved the system for returning an IR38 form online. I am referring to an online statement of affairs. This reflects how complicated the estate is. A simple estate has very little detail. With regard to more complex estates, there will be a lot more people with expensive properties, bank accounts and all the rest. The online system is to facilitate and support people at the difficult time involved. We are also engaged with the Courts Service. We hope to have a single reporting arrangement that would cover our requirements and those of the Courts Service. I remember meeting the head of the Courts Service around our plans, and the service was not then ready to move to a full e-probate system. We said we would go ahead with the online statement of affairs, which would facilitate the Courts Service building on it. I know that the Courts Service has announced its plans for eProbate.",

It comes back to how the legislation is framed. It will probably depend on the Courts Service completing its work so that we can have an integrated process. If there is work required, we commit to studying it. We will get back to the committee on it."

What happens is that a person has to wait until they receive their grant of probate. They then apply for estate clearance. If Revenue asks no questions within 35 days, the person can proceed to administer the estate. Revenue does come back with questions. It seems a little haphazard considering that the rest of the system, such as that for the capital acquisitions tax return form, the SA.2, is really clear about what is required of people.

During his time in the finance brief, I wrote to the then Minister, Michael McGrath, about the potential for improving how the help to buy scheme works and how it is rolled out. When someone is earning a wage and paying income tax, the help to buy scheme only updates on the online system after January once a person's total income for that year has been dealt with. There is no rolling calculation of someone's eligibility for the help to buy scheme. If someone is working they pay income tax and that is added to their total available moneys every month. This is essentially a person's savings account with Revenue, should they decide to be a first-time buyer of a new home. The problem is that if that person goes sale agreed on a home in the middle of the year and has not reached the total €30,000, they will have potentially paid income tax for six months and will not be entitled to claim it back. We know Revenue payroll notifications, RPNs, are done and companies put in information. I understand the concern that somebody who stops working will not pay enough income tax to the end the year. In general, however, somebody who takes on a mortgage to buy a home will more than likely endeavour to stay in employment. Has any consideration ever been given to a rolling calculation of help to buy eligibility?"

Who is really good at availing of the help to buy scheme? This data would be very valuable for us as policymakers. I invite Revenue to consider publishing a report on who has availed of the help to buy scheme, who it is benefiting most and who is purchasing properties as a result of the scheme. I know the scheme has been a huge success. I hear it anecdotally from friends who have bought their first home using the scheme. It is an incredible scheme to help people who are paying high rents but still have to find a way to save a deposit. This is a way to do that. What data does Revenue collect on the help to buy scheme? Does it plan to publish an independent report on how the scheme has functioned and where the gaps are? One issue I find is that people tell me the €500,000 price ceiling is an issue.

It found that only 61% of the sum allocated could be verified as being spent on target schemes. Mr. Cody has said previously, and at this meeting, that Revenue is the collection agency in relation to that. It is extremely concerning that 39% of money collected from a scheme, the primary stated purpose of which was to try to change consumers' behaviours and which has the second purpose of ring-fencing that money for measures to improve the welfare of some of the most vulnerable in the State and for other schemes to meet our carbon targets, cannot be verified as doing that. The figure for carbon tax collected between 2020 and 2023 is €1.36 billion. Do we have a figure for carbon tax collected in 2024?"

                "I think it influences the debate a little like we have had a debate here about whether, if we had more resources to look at this, we would be able to close the tax gap. That is the purpose. We are not opposed to the concept of tax gap analysis and we have done it in relation to, as I mentioned, mineral fuel. The purpose, from a tax administration point of view, is to identify a tax gap but also to identify where that gap is and, ultimately, who the people are. I think there are issues around what will happen with VAT modernisation, which will give a more global view of transaction-by-transaction data, and you can apply analytics to that. I think there will be future developments in relation to tax gap analysis in Ireland, and I think there is stuff we can do and have done based on the PAYE modernisation because we get details of every pay cheque issued by employers. The problem with the PAYE payroll tax gap is that what we do not get is the cash that is paid off record or under the counter, and that is what you are trying to measure with a tax gap analysis: what a shadow economy is. We are doing some work with our PAYE data because if you look at patterns you can see that these five businesses are roughly the same, these four have wage levels of X and this one has wage levels of Y. A subject that has come up a lot here in Ireland over the past couple of years is the reporting on non-taxable benefits. We have full data for that, and that has shown a very interesting potential gap. What I would love - I said this earlier around rental - is full data on everything, but the tax gap tries to measure the thing that is not recorded. It is a bit like drugs. It is a bit like all that.",

The Supreme Court, in the judgment, said that this is not the end of it and that there will be further cases. I know the committee is interested in this, and the chapter is in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report. There are three State bodies involved: Revenue in relation to tax, the Department of Social Protection in relation to social insurance, and the WRC in relation to employment rights. What I have seen in my career is that the challenge has increasingly been about employment rights rather than fiscal matters. The tax treatment is nearly the same either way.

It is a comprehensive programme of actions designed to speed up the delivery of critical infrastructure across the State. This action plan responds to well-documented challenges of lengthy development timelines, fragmented processes and rising costs. These have all been identified as major barriers to achieving Ireland’s housing, energy, and climate objectives.",

Reforms here aim to achieve a better balance towards the common good by addressing the incentives that drive a disproportionate reliance on the courts in planning and regulatory matters. While access to justice remains protected, the reforms will reduce incentives for excessive litigation, clarify rules on standing and remedies, and introduce fast-track pathways for nationally significant projects that are in the common good, through new legislation.",
                    "The second pillar is regulatory simplification and reform. This means identifying where regulation leads to excessive process, rather than improved outcomes. It also means examining the structure of our regulatory environment, the practices applied by regulatory bodies and how they communicate with one another and with applicants. In practical terms, there is scope for improved outcomes by applying parallel processes, mandatory statutory timelines and measuring the performance of our regulatory bodies.",
                    "The third pillar is co-ordination and delivery reform. This implements the reforms outlined in the programme for Government. It means my Department assumes a more central co-ordination role on the delivery of critical infrastructure, providing certainty to other Departments through multi-year funding commitments to underpin five-year sectoral plans and reforms to the infrastructure guidelines. Across government, it means driving and embedding a delivery-first culture, including a balance between risk and delivery that incorporates the potential cost of delay.",

My query is in relation to the ten-year period. Is it that they are the actions, that is what happens and then it is left until 2035, or what are the actions coming out of that? Will new action plans be agreed coming out of those or how exactly is that going to work?"

We have tried to front-load the interventions and actions we make so we can see the benefits of having legal reform, regulatory reform and simplification, better co-ordination delivery and improved public acceptance. They are the four areas identified. Most of those are to be progressed in 2026. We have already set out the national development plan review, which the Deputy will know about, and sectoral plans have been published in recent weeks setting out the trajectory of projects and of priorities across all areas of Government for the next number of years. The Deputy's point about five and ten years obviously relates to the overall capital investment. We have set out the €275 billion over ten years in the five-year sectoral plans. However, the reforms here are not about the investment. They are about how we change the practice and the delivery which is too slow. Doing that quickly is imperative to ensure the investment we have set aside yields improved delivery and that is the nature of what is set out."

The reality is that the way previous Governments have treated infrastructure has been abysmal and we see the direct results that has had. We see it particularly when storms hit or when people want to be able to build housing, providing housing or be able to attract jobs to areas. The state of our infrastructure has been horrific. I have a number of questions in relation to this. One of the things that makes me a bit nervous when it is Fianna Fáil, is whether there is much of an approach in terms of deregulation. We have seen what Fianna Fáil did previously and the impact that it had and I have to ask that question. I was also a bit concerned that it seemed to me that there was an awful lot of blame-shifting. Of course, we know there are serious issues but it did seem like a lot of blame-shifting from Government and other people. First and foremost, it is very clear that the reason we do not have the infrastructure is because of a lack of investment from Governments."

We have responded to that around the investment piece. However, there is a well-documented need and an evidence base to drive reform and infrastructure delivery and that is why there needs to be much more balance around regulation. We need to cut some rules, regulations and processes which are not adding value but are causing excessive delay. We also need to have a wider debate about the level of regulation around certain areas within the economy to ensure we have growth and delivery as a means to drive the strategic direction of the State. This is all about co-ordination and delivery of reform as well, and that is why the practical measures we have set out in this report will do what the Deputy said earlier in her remarks when she said we all want this to work. Ultimately, it is about how our energy systems, our transport infrastructure and our water infrastructure yields greater abundance across the economy so we can improve investment and increase the opportunities for job creation. That is what we have sought to do in this report."

In 2018, the flood risk management plans identified that 150 flood relief schemes are required to manage the significant risk from flooding. Since then, the OPW has trebled, to the sum of 100, the number of flood relief schemes at design, planning and construction. These are in the first tranche of the schemes and commencing work on the tranche 2 schemes is constrained by the availability of specialist engineering skills for designing flood relief schemes.",

Twelve of these projects are included in the first phase of implementation, with interim measures being piloted by Killybegs. The Buncrana flood relief scheme has an estimated budget of €6.8 million and, when built, will protect 32 properties. Work on the design of a viable flood relief scheme is progressing and is due to be submitted for planning consent in quarter three of 2027 and completed in 2031. Nine properties at Elm Park that experienced significant flooding in 2012 and in 2017 are included in this scheme's overall benefitting area. The estimated cost of managing the flood risk for these nine properties in Elm Park is about €1 million. This is a viable option and work to progress the design and planning consent is continuing. Donegal County Council is leading the scheme delivery and has been in correspondence with the residents of Elm Park.",

I understand that all but one of these homeowners have opted to avail of the defective block scheme, at a cost of €2.9 million. I recognise that the residents are concerned about the length of time before these flood scheme works would be completed and have asked my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy James Browne, with myself that consideration be given to relocation options. The Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan, has held two meetings with me to explore a viable workable solution for the homeowners. Work on a possible option is progressing with the affected homeowners, the Department of housing, and with local government."

I have asked the Minister of State for a predicted cost for installing flood defences but it is very clear that the construction of these flood defences and giving temporary rental accommodation to these residents will also cost the State. Offering them a long-term proper solution is the only way out of this and it is the only way forward. Temporary flood measures are a complete waste of money and will only temporarily slow down a flow of water and allow evacuation of these properties properly. We have seen people nearly killed in this site. I know we have been looking at this and there have been many meetings but I just do not see why it is taking so long. Will the Minister of State ensure the final decision is made before Christmas to give these people some hope so that homeowners can finally have some peace, knowing that this distressing situation can be solved?"

Houses in Inver face real risks of the coastal defences failing. Those defences must be progressed and fixed soon. The Minister of State has visited Donegal town courthouse.

I will arrange for the review to commence in advance of 2027 and for a public consultation to take place during 2026.",
                    "A number of stakeholders have been pointing to challenges arising from the implementation of the amended legislation, including the protected disclosure processes and procedures. The statutory review will be an opportunity to bring to light any issues arising by consulting a more complete range of stakeholders and hearing their respective perspectives. It is clearly preferable to put forward amendments that are well considered and based on the experience and evidence of all relevant stakeholders. The consultation will provide an opportunity to ensure that is done.",
                    "It is important to note that the legislation has only been in force for three years and many of the provisions in the Act have yet to be fully tested in practice and in the courts. The legislation was designed to encourage workers to report instances of potential wrongdoing. Given the amended Act only commenced on 1 January 2023, my Department has only two full years of statistics on the number of reports of wrongdoing received by Departments, public bodies and prescribed persons. The statistics suggest that the volume of reports received is increasing. In 2023, more than 1,100 reports were received, while in 2024, the number was just over 1,500. This increase suggests a greater awareness of the amendments that were introduced in 2022 among workers and that more workers felt motivated to make a protected disclosure under the framework.",
                    "In the meantime, effective ways to address the issues arising from the ongoing implementation of the protected disclosures legislation include increased training and guidance for employers, regulators and designated recipients, as well as providing more guidance to workers to ensure their concerns are directed to the appropriate channels."

I had concerns at the time, which I have raised again numerous time this year, about protected disclosures not going directly to Ministers and those Ministers then being able to say they cannot deal with them because they are with the protected disclosures office. There was an element of concern about that at the time and it is still a huge area of concern. I ask the Minister to look at this personally.

We have made that available but in this particular one, it depends on the Department of Transport. There is no point in saying it does not. It is either that or it is the local authority's own funding. As I said, we have made changes to the minor works scheme and we will work closely with the local authorities as we have but they have to come back to us to seek funding. If we can offer that support, if it falls within the threshold, then, yes, we will support them. I would say to the Deputy that, ideally, he needs to reach out to the Department of Transport working with the local authority to try to drive on this scheme that bit further.

The storm on 9 December of this year showed again that people in east Cork feel genuine fear every time a severe weather warning is issued. These storms are not slowing down, yet the Midleton flood relief scheme is still not expected to reach planning until some point next year, as the Minister of State said. Completion is even further out. In the meantime, people's homes, livelihoods and local businesses remain at risk and the State is exposed to repeated multimillion euro damages and costs. Given the scale of impact on Midleton in particular, can the Minister of State commit to visiting the town and engaging directly with businesses and residents on this urgent matter? It would be a great relief and reassurance if he could visit again because of the fear they constantly have."

I understand it; no one knows this more than myself. It is about trying to deliver a scheme. We get one chance to get it right; if we do not, it will flood. This takes time and it is complex. When we go in and start the job, yes, we will leave Midleton in a much better place. People want to see that happening now but the interim measures, and the changes we have made to the minor works scheme, is a huge help to the local authorities.

I know it will not satisfy everyone because it is one section, but the changes I have made to the minor works scheme mean that Cork County Council, working with the Deputy and other public representatives, could move to drive more of the interim measures.

Is there a way in which we can reduce that burden on them while maintaining transparency and safeguards that ensure public money is spent correctly? Is there a way in which we can tell small businesses that there is a route for them into this that is less bureaucratic and cumbersome and more streamlined and, therefore, allows businesses to get on with what they do rather than filling out forms, and instead of trying to justify a process, we let them get on with the business of providing whatever service, construction or so on they provide?"

The actions address the 12 barriers to the timely delivery of infrastructure that were highlighted in the report published by my Department in July. A four-week online and in-person public consultation last summer supported the preparation of that report published in July by providing an opportunity for stakeholders and the general public from across the country to feed into this work.

This will benefit every county and region of Ireland, as infrastructure projects play an essential role in supporting Ireland’s balanced economic growth and meeting the demands of a rapidly expanding population.",

It was established under the public service pensions Act 2012. The provisions of the scheme are clearly set out in law. All new-entrant public servants hired after 1 January 2013 are members of the single scheme. The introduction of the scheme is instrumental in ensuring the sustainability of public service pensions, particularly in the context of improved life expectancy and rising public service employee numbers. As the single scheme uses a career-averaging model, members' retirement benefits are based on a percentage of their pensionable earnings throughout their public service careers. For each pay period, members accrue amounts towards their retirement benefits. The total accrued at retirement, with adjustments for inflation, determines their final retirement benefits. This is payable in addition to any social welfare pension entitlement.",

Uniformed staff can accrue more benefits over their expected shorter public service careers in recognition of their retirement age. When uniformed staff reach normal retirement age, they can retire and receive their retirement lump sum and occupational pension benefit payments. While single scheme pension benefits are integrated with the contributory State pension, these benefits are separate and additional to any entitlement they may have to the State pension, which is paid from the age of 66 by the Department of Social Protection.",

Overall, the pay bill is a function of public service numbers and the costs associated with public service pay agreements. The current agreement, Public Service Agreement 2024-2026, was agreed in January 2024 and ratified by public service unions and representative associations in March 2024. This agreement achieves a balanced approach to public service pay in the context of both the State's fiscal position and the broader economic environment. The agreement provides for general round increases totalling 9.25% and a provision for local bargaining of 1% of the basic pay cost. In total, the agreement will cost approximately €3.6 billion spread over four budget years.",

An assessment of pension costs requires individual member data along with detailed data on the varied pension scheme rules and entitlements by sector, for example, the civil service, health, education and local authority sectors.

There is incredible history in the town, and I think it is fair to say that there is a lot of frustration locally that we are being undersold in terms of our status as a heritage town and our tourism potential. We definitely have not reached our full potential for a town with such great heritage and history. There is a lot of great work going on locally to try to address that and I will come back to that. However, that some of our greatest assets are closed to the public is a major challenge. As I mentioned, the castle is closed now for the winter season until March.

Both of these activities are planned for completion in quarter two of 2026.

With forthcoming regulations that will allow developers to deliver that electricity infrastructure independently, the deployment of renewable generation and storage can certainly be accelerated. A good co-ordinated approach across government will be essential to make that possible. I welcome the progress the Minister has made on the action plan.

We brought forward the 1 October deadline and announced that earlier this year to bring greater clarity and certainty because families last year, particularly in the March-April period, were fierce frustrated not knowing what the future held in education terms for their children. We brought forward the 1 October deadline. The deadline was put in place to ensure we knew what the demand was for 1 September 2026. Those figures are being gone through meticulously to make sure that the classes are opened where the demand is and that we understand where the demand is. A lot of that work is ongoing. We hope to announce a number of the classes this week, but there is a huge amount of work still going through where the numbers are. The engagement between the council and the families is ongoing.",

Earlier this week, another curveball or grenade - call it whatever you want - was thrown into the system and has caused major concern. That is the issue of what is now a recommendation. What does it mean for children and assessments of need this year and next? The Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO, said yesterday that it was deeply disappointed. It said this was an act of bad faith and that the Departments of education and children and equality did not consult the INTO. It seems that the Department of children and its Minister are saying that in the future, the Department of education will reach an agreement. What exactly is the state of affairs there? Teachers and principals contact us regularly. They are deeply concerned that they will have an additional responsibility that many feel they are not qualified to deliver."

Right now, you do not need an assessment of need to access education. A lot of work has been done, and I know that officials are meeting education partners today to bring clarity on the very question asked by the Deputy. We will certainly bring extreme clarity. If this system is to work within education, all our education partners must have bought in, including the teacher unions and people right across the education spectrum. Every one of those people plays a significant role in special education. I assure the Deputy that intense work is ongoing at the moment to ensure we bring absolute clarity to the roles involved in decision-making, and that decisions are guided by the best possible outcomes for children. Those will be finalised. We will update the House when those issues are agreed between the various education partners."

Schools have autonomy in their spending, allowing them to make decisions on spending independently at school level. The financial support services unit, FSSU, funded by the Department is an important source of advice and support to schools on financial matters, including budgeting and cash flow management. In circumstances where a school is in financial difficulty, the Department requests the FSSU to carry out an evaluation of the financial position in the school. The Department is committed to offering all available and appropriate supports to these schools, which may include an advance in capitation grant funding, or other measures, as may be appropriate. As a result of such evaluations, a small number of schools required an advance in capitation grant funding to be paid to address immediate cash flow issues. The Department continues to liaise with the FSSU regarding supports and guidance to all schools.",

In the 2024-25 school year, 61 schools were referred to the FSSU and 17 received an advance in capitation grant funding. In the 2025-26 school year to date, 18 schools were referred to the FSSU and nine received an advance in capitation grant funding. The Department has secured €39 million in budget 2026 towards increased capitation funding for primary, post-primary and special schools. This will result in the standard rates increasing from €224 to €274 for primary schools and from €386 to €406 for post-primary schools. The increases in the budget are in addition to the 12% increases as part of budget 2025. The last three budgets have resulted in an increase in the level of capitation grant rates of almost 50% paid to primary schools and approximately 28% paid to post-primary schools."

Was that a way of saying that, for example, 600 parents applied for their children through the portal and we were able to provide those places? The vacant places that the Minister of State talks about, and I have raised this previously, are phantom places because if there are children at home without an appropriate school place, it does not matter how many vacant places we have. If they are not appropriate, they are a waste of space and a waste for a child.",

If we are taking away the need for an assessment of need to gain a special educational place but there will be an educational aspect to it, who is going to do that? Are they going to be qualified to do it? If a child rocks up to a school in September, how will the school forward plan for the needs of that child? How do we make sure that the school is the appropriate school for that child? I am really concerned that we have not got a handle on that. We are now entering into a new phase in terms of how we allocate places when we have not managed the phase we are currently in."

The commission was the principal recommendation of the report of the scoping inquiry into historical sexual abuse in day and boarding schools run by religious orders. The scoping inquiry’s report also recognised the significance of the issue of redress for survivors and their expressed wish that those running schools where child sexual abuse occurred should be held financially accountable.

The interdepartmental group has commenced this work, is committed to meeting regularly and aims to report to the Department of education within 18 months. This will not impede the progress of the commission of investigation, which will begin its work in parallel. The commission does not have a role in relation to redress."

He described in very emotional terms how he was never able to read bedtime stories to his children, how he imagined it was all his fault, and the shame he suffered all his life. He considered himself to be a dunce and stupid because they were the labels that were associated with him. He spoke of how his entire life was limited in terms of job opportunities. He could not admit that he could not read and write because he did not want to get into the reasons for that. He has only been able to come to terms with it and make a Garda complaint very recently. What he wants to know is when he will he get an acknowledgement and an apology from the State that allowed this to happen. When will he be able to tell his story? I note from what the Minister of State has said that the timeline for this sounds worryingly long. Stephen is in his 70s. Hopefully, he will be here for quite a while yet but people are getting old and they need to know they are going to have some opportunity to tell their story and get redress soon."

That work is ongoing. The group is meeting very regularly. The report is to be within the Department. There is a huge amount of work to be done. It has to be done meticulously and correctly. The group is committed to reporting within the 18 months. It is very important that the timeline is stuck to because, as the Deputy has said, many of the survivors are getting on in years. They really want some kind of closure - I mean that in the broadest possible sense because it may not be full closure - regarding the horrific crimes committed against them."

Whether it falls within a strict definition of sexual abuse is debatable but it was sadistic, brutal and life-changing abuse. Today, when he was describing the physical and mental damage done to him, he expressed concern about his classmates who also suffered this abuse. He does not know what happened to them but he is still worried about that and about the damage that was done to them because it was so savage and brutal. What he wants is a clear assurance and for the Minister of State or the Government to say that he will get an apology and an opportunity to tell his story and that there will be some redress for the lifelong damage done to him through the sadistic abuse he endured."

This reflects an overall decline in post-primary enrolments for the area since 2023 and the fact that there are more first year places available than sixth class students in the area for the forthcoming school year. Enrolment pressures in an area may not always relate to capacity. They may instead relate to school choice and external draw factors.

There are four projects planned at post-primary schools in the area, including a large-scale major project which is at construction and which will cater for over 1,000 pupils. This will provide good additional capacity relative to the school’s current enrolment. This investment will ensure that all pupils will continue to have access to an appropriate education place.",

Furthermore, as with other areas, the Department will continue to liaise with the local authority in respect of its county development plan with a view to identifying any potential evolving long-term school accommodation requirements."

Two new special classes were sanctioned at this school by the National Council for Special Education for the 2025-26 term. While accommodation for special classes can be provided within existing unused accommodation in many instances, modular accommodation can be installed under existing planning exemptions. In this case, a planning application was required. The planning application is to facilitate the provision of both special education and mainstream classrooms under the Department’s SEN reconfiguration and modular accommodation programme. There is provision for one special class within the planned modular accommodation. Additionally, the provision of modular classrooms will facilitate the repurposing of existing accommodation to facilitate the second special class. The school has been approved for grant funding to support these requirements for repurposing work. The local authority has made a request for further information in respect of the planning application for the required modular accommodation and a response to this is currently being finalised. Project management supports have been appointed to support the school in the delivery of this important project. Departmental officials and the project mangers will continue to work closely with the school authority to ensure that special class provision is made as soon as possible.",

It is an incredibly historic school and one of the original model schools. The difficulty is that, in the meantime, there is a temporary provision in a local community hall where, only on a part-time basis, education is being provided. The difficulty with that is that many parents moved their children from full-time places either in other schools where they were not in an ASD class or from a preschool where there was dedicated special education. They have gone from a situation of being in full-time education to now being in reduced hours because the local community hall is being used for other purposes. I understand that there is a short period in terms of planning, building and so on, but where a child is on reduced hours for six or eight months, the impact, including on the parents, is very significant. I urge the Minister of State to make sure this project is completed as soon as possible."

Work will be ongoing over the coming weeks and months to give clarity in that regard. I reassure teachers and school communities that the policy is not being developed on a wing and a prayer. We are developing this policy because it is best for students and school communities. We have a very cumbersome system at the moment.

As part of this allocation, the Department will place a strong emphasis on provision for children with special educational needs, with a particular focus on meeting annual school place needs.

There are only two set-down places for minibuses for children with disabilities who are brought to the school and there is a need for five. There is a lot of space to do this but building is about to continue, which means that when the situation is eventually resolved, it will be a lot more costly.

This provided great consistency and continuity for the school and pupils. The person covering the release days did so in every cluster, meaning that the release days almost gave rise to a full-time position. That was one benefit of the scheme.",

The club is going to do all that. I can get an affidavit. The archdiocese is saying the capitation grant does not cover it so it is looking for clarification from the Department regarding the archdiocese's demand for an increase in the capitation grant. Some of the things it is looking for are outside the scope of it. The ball is back in the court of the Department. The archdiocese is saying that it might look at it at a later stage and that when a sports capital grant is established to cover the running costs of the project, this proposal can be revisited. What it is looking for is madness. At the end of the day, common sense should apply. It is an area of high deprivation and this decision will hugely affect the children. An astro pitch is already there but it is safer to play on the road than it is on the actual pitch, given the state it is in. I am really frustrated about this."

                "Since yesterday, the depth of public anger at the Government's decision to withdraw funding supports for blister pack medication has been laid bare. The reaction has been extraordinary. Pharmacists and carers have been inundated with messages of fear and disbelief. People who have never contacted a TD before have been calling constituency offices begging for someone to act. Yesterday, the Taoiseach at least conceded that he would look at this issue but today's newspaper tells us that the Fine Gael Minister, Jennifer Carroll MacNeill, is not budging. She is refusing to recognise the disaster she is presiding over. Vulnerable people who depend on blister packs are being told by a Fine Gael Minister they will face fees in the new year and are on their own. It is a Scrooge-like response in the weeks before Christmas.",
                "Blister packs are not a luxury. They are a lifeline. Tens of thousands rely on them, including older people managing multiple medications, people with dementia or Alzheimer's, and those with intellectual disabilities, brain injuries or mental health challenges. Carers and front-line workers know exactly what will happen without them. These packs allow people to live independently. They prevent confusion, mixed doses, missed doses and double dosing. The human stories coming in since yesterday are stark. We heard from a woman caring for her grandmother whose medication changes constantly due to supply issues. Without blister packs, which she cannot afford to pay for, her grandmother loses her independence. We heard from front-line workers deeply worried about their frail clients living alone, often taking ten or more tablets a day, who are confused over what tablets to take and when. We heard from families caring for loved ones with dementia, who finally adapted to blister packs after enormous effort. They now feel abandoned. One daughter wrote about her 91-year-old mother who lives alone, already battling rising bills, and relies on blister packs to remain safe at home. She said that taking this away will destroy her independence. These are not isolated stories.",
                "This is occurring in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis. Today, the CSO announced a rise in annual inflation that is almost twice the rate projected by Government. When people are told that blister packs may now cost €20, €30 or even €50 a month, they simply cannot absorb it. The contrast could not be starker. The Government has found billions for developers, banks and landlords, yet when it comes to older people, dementia patients and people on disability payments, the approach suddenly becomes penny-pinching. This is a political choice, not a financial necessity. The most troubling part is these concerns are not new. Sinn Féin's health spokesperson, David Cullinane, raised this with Government in October, during the community pharmacy agreement debate. He warned that narrowing supports for monitoring dosage systems would expose vulnerable patients to new charges but those warnings were ignored. We now have a decision by a Fine Gael Minister that will increase costs for vulnerable patients, undermine medication adherence, overwhelm carers and potentially lead to avoidable GP visits and hospital admissions. It is a decision that pharmacists, carers and front-line workers say is a false economy.",
                "I will put some clear questions to the Minister. Why is blister pack support being removed without any impact assessment, consultation or plan for those who depend on it? Why were warnings from pharmacists, carers and Sinn Féin ignored? Will the Government now act immediately to reverse this decision and protect vulnerable patients from real harm?"

He outlined to the House, and I will use the opportunity to spell out again today, the supports the Government is giving to the least well-off and the most vulnerable in our society. He gave a lot of detail on the drugs payment scheme and how it operates. Under that scheme, cardholders and their families only have to pay a maximum of €80 per month for approved prescribed drugs and medicines. This has improved dramatically over the last number of years. The resources the Government has available to it, thanks to the economic growth that has been made available through the financial policies we have pursued, all of which have been objected to by Deputy Carthy and his party, has resulted in us being in a position to invest very heavily in the areas of health and social protection. Last week alone, the most vulnerable in our society saw the Christmas bonus start to be paid out.",

The Taoiseach outlined yesterday that he believed there is still an opportunity for the HSE to engage with the Irish Pharmacy Union over the time ahead to see whether this issue can be further discussed. On the same lines as what the Taoiseach said, that opportunity is there. He outlined why he believes this is important, the importance of the drugs payment scheme and blister packs, and how they have supported people over many years.",
                "The reality is that health now has the largest budget it has ever had. There is €27 billion in health for 2026. It is not an insignificant amount of money. I know the party opposite laid out its proposals with regard to health and social protection and a number of other areas, which did not include everything that the Government included, particularly in the area of social protection for budget 2026, yet it derided the Government for things it did include for social protection. The Taoiseach in his response yesterday outlined that the opportunity still exists for the HSE to engage with the Irish Pharmacy Union, and I expect that engagement to happen."

People with disabilities or care needs are particularly struggling and the Government does not get that. The way we know it does not get that is because there are vulnerable people who need blister packs to get by in their day-to-day lives and to have some semblance of independence. Currently they get those blister packs free of charge and this Scrooge-like Government through its Scrooge-like Minister is going to charge them €20, €30, maybe even €50 per month come the new year. I am asking the Minister to finally get it and get live to the fact that people are going through really tough times and, rather than a kick in the teeth from Government, they need a little bit of support. What they need above all is that the supports currently in place are not removed. He did not answer my question directly, so I will ask him again. Please will he give assurance to those people who rely on blister packs that the Government will not impose these charges in January? Will it finally hear the cries coming into all of our constituency offices for a little bit of understanding on the part of this out-of-touch Government?"

                "Today I again raise the issue of overcrowding in our emergency departments. Last week, we saw 14 ambulances queued up for up to eight hours outside Wexford hospital. As a local representative for Limerick, this healthcare crisis is something I know the Minister is also familiar with. In our city of Limerick on 3 December, UHL management once again urged the public to avoid the emergency department as 350 people attended in one day. Last month the Minister for Health opened another 96-bed unit at UHL, which has done little to mitigate the overcrowding caused by decades of underinvestment. This week we saw again 103 people on trolleys on Tuesday. We need a vision for healthcare in the mid-west beyond the next five years, and not just more short termism. At this stage the people of Limerick are living with a hospital in a permanent state of crisis. If we are to address the root cause of the problem in the mid-west, which is a lack of capacity and only one emergency department for the entire region, then next week the people of Limerick, Clare and Tipperary need the Minister to commit to a new model 3 hospital in the mid-west that will deliver a second emergency department. Squeezing more people into UHL simply will not work. Politics and politicians have failed the healthcare needs of the mid-west.",
                "As the crisis in our emergency department rages, we have a bad flu season this year. It is a flu season we knew was coming because of the data available since the summer from Australia. The low uptake of the flu vaccine is frightening, and this is something Government has failed to address through an information and awareness campaign to urge people to get the vaccine. The vaccine should be free and it should be universal. We have been saying this for ten years. I cannot understand why we have not been listened to. This is a proven way to take pressure off emergency departments as thousands are going to be hospitalised this year due to flu. It is also incredibly concerning to hear reports that the enhanced flu vaccine was not obtained for cost reasons. As my colleague Deputy Sherlock said, this is appalling penny pinching and it will have serious costs for older people and for scheduled care in our hospitals. We know the enhanced flu vaccine outperforms the standard vaccine, particularly with older people, and this is madness, given the data we have from Australia.",

Will he account for why the Government did not roll out the enhanced flu vaccine and will he commit to a public awareness campaign to make the flu vaccine universal?"

                "I thank Deputy Sheehan for raising an issue that is very important to both of us, the current situation in University Hospital Limerick. Deputy Sheehan was at the opening of the 96-bed block with me and others. He would agree that there have been substantial improvements made in University Hospital Limerick over the past number of years. It is starting from a really low base, there is no doubt about it. Our colleague from the mid-west, the former Minister, Alan Kelly, has referred to this on many occasions as well. The reconfiguration of the midwestern hospitals group a number of years ago has left a negative legacy with regard to healthcare provision in the mid-west that several Governments, including the current one, have had to try to unwind and deal with. The reality is that over the past number of years we have had a substantial deficiency as regards bed capacity in the mid-west that this Government is dealing with. The new 96-bed unit is open. The second 96-bed unit, which Deputy can see himself as he passes, in Dooradoyle is well under way. Planning permission for that was more difficult than we expected. There is an options appraisal, as the Deputy pointed out, that is with the Minister for Health. It is the Minister for Health who will ultimately bring forward proposals with regard to this. The Minister was in Limerick, where she has arrived unannounced. Oftentimes Ministers are criticised for coming to the hospital on an announced basis. She has arrived in on an unannounced basis and has seen first-hand what Deputy Sheehan and I have seen. I do not in any way dispute what the Deputy said earlier, but the numbers in UHL are going in the right direction. Today there are 26 people on trolleys. That is 26 too many. Ideally there should be zero, but it is not that long ago that the Deputy and I would remember that number being three, four or five times that amount. Bed capacity is the route to this. I pay tribute to the staff of the hospital, many of whom are my neighbours and Deputy Sheehan's neighbours. They have had to work in appalling conditions over many years while we had to grapple with the fact that there were successive elements of underinvestment. There is substantial investment in UHL, and I am glad the Deputy has recognised it, but there is also an options appraisal. The Minister for Health will bring forward proposals with regard to options A, B and C. She has already alluded to the fact that A and B will likely continue.",
                "There will be more room at Dooradoyle and other units in Ennis and Nenagh will continue to be invested in. The surgical unit up at the Mount is currently well under way and the Bon Secours private hospital is open. Significant investment from the public and private sectors is helping to transform the mid-west. We have also seen significant investment in St. Camillus's, St. Ita's and Croom Orthopaedic Hospital. This is all improving the delivery of healthcare for the mid-west. I am not for one minute saying we are finished; there is further work that needs to be delivered on this.",

I use this opportunity to remind people that anyone over 60 or in the age group of two to 17 can get it free, as can healthcare workers. The HSE has done many campaigns. Indeed, on the day of the opening of the hospital in Limerick, it did a campaign in Limerick to try to encourage people to get the vaccine. I encourage people in the House to get it. I have got it, as I am from a cohort of people who are immunosuppressed and need to get it. I encourage anybody who still has not got the flu vaccine to go out and get it."

                "Taxi drivers have been staging protests about Uber, a billion euro company that is pushing a fixed-fare model onto drivers. They held a briefing here in the Dáil yesterday where representatives reported that this model, if it succeeded, could cut the earnings of many drivers by 30% to 50% and undercut those who do not even use Uber. There will be significant repercussions for the 22,000 licensed taxi drivers, a very important cohort of the workforce in this country. It could also potentially lead to a massive increase in work hours, with the implications of that for fatigue and public safety. Taxi drivers described it as a bombshell. They were very emotional talking about the vilification they had endured on social media, for example, for the action they took in recent weeks.",
                "The Irish taxi system was regulated to protect drivers' livelihoods and to protect customer service for the general public. It is governed by the NTA on behalf of the Government and is licensed, Garda vetted, has vehicle standards and a public fare review every two years that the public can feed into and under which taxi drivers have themselves rejected increases. Is the Government at all concerned that this system of regulation is threatened by massive corporations that are not even based in this country and do not necessarily pay tax in this country?",
                "The fixed-fare option for passengers can look great in theory. No matter what event happens - a road closure, diversion, toll, crash or whatever - they will not pay more than that price. However, any of the extra costs - time lost or extra fuel - are borne completely by the drivers, and passengers should not be fooled. In the US, from 2018 to 2024, Uber increased its prices by 18% per year. At the same time, drivers got 12% less than under the previous model. Uber gets it in and then ramps up the charges. I do not have time to explain it but the dynamic pricing these apps are using is completely different to anything that has gone before. They are using AI and behavioural patterns of individual drivers. They are following the types of fare they normally take and then sending them fares. They are completely individualising it. The CEO of Uber talked about offering the right trip at the right price to the right driver. Uber monitors work patterns and ultimately monitors each driver to increase its profits. The model allows Uber to sell a driver's time to a passenger for the maximum it can get while paying the driver the minimum they will accept.",

Will it ensure that algorithms are not allowed to decide the fare structure in this country or the conditions workers have to tolerate?"

                "During the week, the news of the derogation was welcome, but the real work starts now. Unfortunately, unelected bureaucrats in Europe have put in a proviso, because of the habitats directive, that over the coming years, what a cow does in a field and the impact of this on the Barrow, Nore, Suir, Blackwater, Owenriff or whatever other river will have to be screened. This will cost the State millions of euro. I do not know if there will be enough scientists to do all of this in the timeline. There is a bigger and wider problem of flooding that the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Moran, will have seen. The problem is that of objections and how the habitats directive is being used to block people. We see difficulties now if people try to extend a port or an airport, build a road or build a house. I have seen young people in my area who are 40 miles from Lough Corrib, but because the Sinking River goes into the River Clare and goes on to Lough Corrib, people building a house in a rural place have to spend €2,500 in case it may have an impact on the site. A few years ago in the Minister of State, Deputy Harkin's constituency, a snail that did not exist held up work on Lough Talt by Irish Water to provide water to 9,000 people or 10,000 people in the area.",
                "This cannot continue. It is blocking the Government and tying its hands. The Government has dealt with this on Lough Funshinagh as well. The Government, councils and private investors trying to make progress, be it building houses, building roads or whatever infrastructure, are all being blocked. This legislation started off in 1997, but the interpretation being used by the European Court of Justice, ECJ, kangaroo court, as I would call it, of the habitats directive, aided and abetted by NGOs funded by the State, is trying to wrap the State up in knots. It cannot continue. I commend the Minister, Deputy O'Callaghan. Yesterday in Brussels, he spoke about how the ECJ interpretation of immigration and so on was becoming a problem. If the Government wants to make progress on housing, roads or all the major infrastructural projects, then Ministers in the Council of Ministers in Europe will have to get together. We are well able to come in here at times, and Europe will send over more legislation on top of what we have already on whichever item we are talking about."

                "In his intervention, Deputy Fitzmaurice mentioned Lough Funshinagh in County Roscommon. I know that area intimately, unfortunately for all of the wrong reasons. The poor misfortunate people there had to put up with years of torture, for want of a better word, because an attempt by the Office of Public Works and Roscommon County Council to relieve flooding was held up and objected to. As Deputy Fitzmaurice referenced, the habitats directive was the principal instrument. The Minister of State, Deputy Moran, has made huge progress in this area. This will be one of the first Christmases that the people there will at least have pumps running and know that the terrible situation is not going to happen to them on Christmas Day again.",
                "I agree with the Deputy's wider point about EU simplification, and so does the President of the European Commission. One of the hallmarks of the President of the European Commission's contribution to the state of the Union address was the need for the Union to look at EU simplification. I do not believe that it was ever intended that an instrument originally designed to protect the habitats of flora and fauna would be used as an instrument or a method to allow sewage to flow through people's houses, regardless of the town or village where the flood relief scheme was to take place and regardless of whether there was potable water. We all remember back in the 1990s or the early 2000s the situation with the Galway city water scheme. Galway City Council was the first agent of the State to use imperative reasons of overriding public interest, IROPI. The Deputy will know exactly what I am talking about. When there is an overriding need for public good, we can, as he said, screen out things that would otherwise not be looked favourably upon in an application. However, that is a long and arduous process and it can be appealed.",
                "I agree with the Deputy about our infrastructure, whether it is in the building of a road or a railway or the laying of a water main, such as the one being discussed from north of Limerick to Dublin. All of these things are being objected to by people for spurious reasons, in many cases. The Deputy knows as well as I do that, as soon as someone mentions the Aarhus Convention, they have carte blanche to go the whole way to the Supreme Court. Many people here do not agree with my analysis or the Deputy's, and that is another problem. If legislation was brought before the Dáil tomorrow in terms of harmonising or simplifying Ireland's interpretation of the habitats directive, I am not so sure that everybody who claims to be on the same side as us would all of a sudden jump to that. Certainly, when it comes to the European institutions, we definitely know that is not the case.",

It is about EU simplification. Whether it is in relation to potable water or being able to flush the toilet, it is taking too long. It is not down to a shortage of money. Anyone would tell you that, in most cases, the delivery of infrastructure now has built into it substantial legal fees. An awful lot of the legal fees are being absorbed by cases being contested in the courts over environmental regulations. Like the Deputy, I do not believe that those regulations were ever designed to be interpreted in such a fashion as to prevent people from getting access to potable water. If that is the case, it is time to go back and look at this again.",

I hope that, on top of all the other times I have asked these same questions, something will happen now.",
                "We have a clause in Kerry known as the rural areas under significant urban influence, which I understand was to prevent applicants coming out from towns or other urban settings but is now actually preventing local people - local to their site - who apply for planning permission from getting it. Many times, I have asked here about the restriction preventing family members from building on sites exiting onto national primary and secondary roads, even where there is already an existing exit-entrance serving many other users. The problem is that if this were just an ordinary local road, there would be no problem, but the very same type of road that was never taken in charge by the local authority is being deprived of getting planning in much the same scenarios. This change was signed into law in 2012 by Leo Varadkar, a former leader in this House, and the Minister with responsibility for this, who later agreed with me in this Chamber that a total ban was very wrong. I am asking that this be given back to the local engineers to decide if the exit is safe and if the site distance is of the right standard.",
                "There is a lot of talk about affordable home schemes. We never had any one of those schemes in Kerry. I cannot understand why. I cannot understand how you can call one house an affordable house when the house beside it costs the standard price, is the same size and costs the same to build. Surely to be able to call a house affordable, the materials, the labour or the planning should cost less. I remind the Members opposite that 40% of the cost of building any house today is VAT, other taxes, planning and levies. Could the Government reduce the VAT? There is no VAT on building materials in the UK. I do not think the people are being told the truth about these affordable schemes.",

What will happen now where the builders could use the Government's new proposal to build treatment plants on non-serviced lands-----"

                "I thank Deputy Healy-Rae for raising this. There are more times we agree on things than we disagree. Especially as a neighbour's child, I would like him to think that. On this, I agree with him. If you travel the road from Abbeyfeale to Duagh - I am sure he knows that road very well - there is part of that road in Kerry where there is a very well-developed group of houses with a single entrance out onto a regional road. It is not a national primary or a national secondary road. There is no intensification then or turning movements. That is what the roads engineer in Kerry County Council will tell you because that is what they tell me in Limerick, namely, that wherever there is intensification on a road and turning movements, they worry about people being rear-ended and having crashes, fatalities and so on. I can understand that. Where there is a safety issue on a road, we have to be very conscious of it, but where there is no apparent reason for a person being denied planning permission, particularly if it is on their own land and if, for instance, they have been renting an apartment in Tralee or Killarney and they now want to move back to Tarbert, Moyvane or wherever, it should be very clear in the county development plan policy in the first instance that such movements should be encouraged. There was a report two weeks ago with regard to the issue - I have responsibility for it - about sports clubs in south Kerry, particularly on the Iveragh Peninsula, depopulation and the demographic changes in the GAA. We will have to address it. There will not be a sewerage scheme at every crossroads in the country, but if developers can bring in their own types of solution, where it is a small scheme under the supervision of the local authority and where they can discharge to surface water with a licence from Kerry County Council or Limerick County Council, I do not see why that cannot be allowed. There would not then be the situation we have seen in Reenard and other places where they have to amalgamate GAA clubs just to put out an under-16 team. The population of County Kerry has gone up dramatically, but it has gone up in places like Tralee, Killarney, Kenmare and the other main population bases. If we are to sustain rural life in counties like ours, the first thing you have to be able to do is flush the toilet, because unless you can flush the toilet, you cannot build a house. You cannot pollute the surface water and you cannot have run-off going into dykes.",
                "There are solutions there. Rather than being told at a pre-planning meeting, as I am often told, and I am sure the Deputy is too, that there is no proper solution or there is no way around this, that the soil is too heavy and you cannot possibly sustain a septic tank or a proprietary treatment system like bioCycle, we need to start looking at engineering solutions. If a developer comes in, like in the development I referred to a while ago between Abbeyfeale and Duagh, and if there is a technical solution to deal with sewage properly, under licence and inspection by the local authority, I do not see why we cannot do that. The future of our GAA clubs and our small schools will be utterly dependent on whether we can build houses in those areas. It is not out of a lack of desire or people being unable to afford it. A lot of these are returning sons and daughters who want to live in south Kerry or east Limerick, but I agree with the Deputy that the restrictions that are there will have to be looked at."

You gave the council half an acre or an acre. That land was transferred to the council. In return, the council built the house and you rented it and later got the option to buy it back if you were a farmer. If you were not a farmer, the council acquired a site for you. It is a matter for the councils. If they want to do that, there is no reason they cannot. The most important thing they have to do is to put in a proprietary treatment system that will pass a percolation test.",

There is a narrative out there that if you are building a one-off house, you are somehow polluting the area. That is not the case. I know exactly the types of houses the Deputy is talking about. Grants were given in the 1970s and 1980s for houses less than a particular square footage. Half of the people in the country were reared in such houses. The Deputy is absolutely right. Some of the houses that are being built at the moment are far too big in terms of their energy consumption.",

They are also matters for the Government."

                "The people of County Monaghan received a huge shock this morning with the news that The Northern Standard newspaper, which has been a Monaghan institution for 186 years, is set to close. For generations, The Northern Standard has been a trusted local voice with top-class local journalists, photographers and other staff. It has chronicled every significant event in our community life. It has held to account those of us in political life. Its closure would be a huge loss and it creates real concern about historical records and contemporary reporting. Of course, the disappearance of an historic paper such as The Northern Standard is part of a much wider pattern. Does the Government intend to bring forward any legislation or other supports for local and regional media? As a matter of urgency, will the Government see if an intervention can be made to explore whether there is any possible avenue to save The Northern Standard?"

The Deputy knows as well as I do that media platforms have changed. People's connectivity to local papers has changed. National papers are also under enormous pressure. My Department has in recent years responded positively, within the rules laid down for what we can and cannot do in the context of market intervention. We support young reporters and journalists who act as court reporters. We also support newspapers in terms of local democracy so they can attend local area committee meetings in Carrickmacross, Monaghan or wherever else and ensure that council meeting are reported. An awful lot of the local papers are taking that up.",

I know, for instance, that for road opening licences and road closures, Monaghan and Cavan county councils would be adept at that.",

If it has an archive and is looking to have that archive housed, there may be an opportunity for the National Archives of Ireland to discuss that. I thank the newspaper for what it has done for the people of Monaghan and for democracy. I hope that the journalists and others who work at the paper find employment in the local area. I wish them the best of luck. At this time of the year, Christmas, it is a tough loss for a community. I respect that. I thank the Deputy for raising the issue."

When the Minister was launching the Éigse Michael Hartnett Literary and Arts Festival earlier this year, he acknowledged that there is a need for capital funding for arts in this country. The Limerick Leader reported that he said he wanted to help to develop arts centres, theatres and other artistic infrastructure around the country. I am delighted he said that. However, in a letter to an arts space in Dublin yesterday, the Minister said something completely different. He passed the buck to local authorities and washed his hands of any responsibility for his Department. Why would he be so positive in his message in Limerick and so negative and dismissive of an arts centre in Dublin? Are we to take it that his interest in the arts is only confined to areas outside Dublin?"

Some 18,000 young children are on the waiting list. That is evidence of how ineffective the system is. The announcement was made with no consultation with education staff and there is little or no detail for either education or clinical staff. The timing of the announcement coincided with research from Dublin City University, DCU, on education provider burnout. It comes at a time when parents are still fighting to get an appropriate school place for their children and for assessments of need. Even if they get them, they are then fighting to get the services they are supposed to get. These children are without services, supports and appropriate school places. They are not thriving. They are basically surviving. What the announcement has done is put fear and frustration in the hearts and minds of school staff, parents and children. What the children deserve is support, respect and an appropriate education. Will the Minister tell me how that will be achieved and guaranteed?"

Today, however, I want to zero attention in on the importance of the DART+ programme, in particular the DART+ South West programme. This is pivotal not only in providing the necessary infrastructure that people in my constituency of Dublin Mid-West, Kildare and the greater Dublin area require for rapid and frequent public transport, but is also key to unlocking housing supply, as per the South Dublin County Council development plan and those of other local authorities across the country, to increase the capacity of that line. It is imperative that we do everything we can now to prioritise the delivery of this programme, including, insofar as possible, tendering as much as possible alongside the DART+ South West programme. I thank the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, for his engagement with me on this matter. I look forward to working with the Minister, Deputy O'Donovan, and other Government colleagues to try to make sure we prioritise the delivery of DART+ South West because it is long overdue and is needed to achieve our housing delivery targets and to provide people in Dublin Mid-West with the necessary transport infrastructure they need."

The programme will increase train capacity from 12 to 23 trains per hour. An Coimisiún Pleanála granted permission for DART+ in 2024 and it is estimated the route will serve 56,000 people. The review of the NDP allocated €22.3 billion Exchequer resources to transport from 2026 to 2030, with an additional of €2 billion from the Infrastructure, Climate and Nature Fund to support the Metrolink and other projects.

There is no internal membrane in the roof and no felt inside the slates. Plaster has fallen in from the attic and there is significant mould and woodworm due to water ingress and a lack of insulation. It needs a total overhaul. The school was refused funding under the emergency works scheme two years ago and was recently unsuccessful in its application under the climate action grant scheme. The hall does not have adequate facilities. It is the heartbeat of the school, providing space for PE lessons, drama, staff meetings and after-school services, to name but a few. Will the Minister step in and do something? The school community should not have to fundraise to get this essential facility working for the next 70 years."

If we give €1 million here or €1 million there to different sectors of our own community, it is discussed here in the Chamber but those figures have never been discussed here, even though that money comes from Irish taxpayers.

In the Deputy's local town of Killarney, which I know well, and in Kenmare I am sure they welcomed the reduction of VAT in the budget. That has sustained thousands of jobs all over the country.

This is causing significant disruption and frustration for commuters across Dublin. Businesses across the city are also concerned, particularly as we are in the lead up to the busy Christmas shopping period. The fact that one Luas line going down can cause such havoc in our capital city is indicative of how poorly our city is served by its public transport links. Contrary to what the residents of Dartmouth Square might think, it is vital that we also have a metro serving our capital city, including the south and south-west of the city, in time. We are over-reliant on too few public transport links currently. We have seen this Government delay the shovel-ready DART south-west project. This is a transport link that could go a long way towards addressing the traffic chaos that we have seen on the M50 and the N7. Will the Government urgently reverse course on DART south-west and will it provide us with a functioning, robust public transport system in our capital city?"

To the school's frustration, it has received information that it will have to wait until the national development plan is published before any further progress can be made. As a former teacher, the Minister will understand that this is extremely disappointing because there is a significant demand for ASD classes. There are pupils who need to come into St. Brendan's Community School in Birr. I ask the Minister to urgently intervene with Government to sort out this matter and to allow progress to be made."

What were once small villages are now massive towns with populations as big as Limerick city's. We need to invest in them.

Does the Minister accept that more supports are needed in the current cost-of-living crisis? If we consider the cost of rent in the country, the current system is forcing people into paying double for their accommodation and this is not acceptable."

I have raised it with SOLAS myself on a number of occasions, including very recently. I have actually asked SOLAS as a starting point to review the current placement and allocation system for apprentices, and then to fix it, and to identify any opportunities for improvement. I have also heard anecdotally from engagement with employers who are taking on many apprentices that there can sometimes be a degree of arbitrariness in the system. Even though there is supposed to be a design and methodology in place, it appears that does not always manifest. This is something I have asked SOLAS to look at and take on.",

As with every other post-secondary education route, it is not possible that every programme will be provided in every educational institution. An apprenticeship may be delivered through a particular local ETB but it is actually a national scheme. In our own county of Kildare, which myself and the Cathaoirleach Gníomhach share, farrier apprenticeships are available. They are not available anywhere else, as I understand it, and that is because there is a particular speciality and set of knowledge within Kildare. There are probably exceptions. If people are doing a farrier apprenticeship, Kildare is where they go to do it. There are other skills. Wind turbine maintenance is available on the coast in Tralee, for example. There are other skills that are particular to specific areas. There is also the situation where apprentices are given an offer of a placement and they can decline that if it does not work for them. They can say \"No\" and then the place will be allocated to the next person on the list to take up. They get up to three refusals."

In some cases, we were finding at the committee that someone in Donegal was going to Cork and someone from Cork going to Donegal, both doing the same apprenticeship. It just beggars belief how that happens so I welcome the fact that SOLAS will review, and also fix, this. During recent committees, we heard directly from apprentices about the challenges for their placements. The situation is affecting all ages of apprentices now within a wider age range as the demographic for apprentices has changed significantly, as the Minister knows. There are now more and more apprentices who have families to support and mortgages in one location. This means that their responsibilities at home would be severely impacted as they would need to leave for 12 weeks. It is not sustainable. I welcome the fact that the Minister is going to get SOLAS to look into this. It should stop this whole lottery basis and apprenticeships should be closer to home."

There is pressure on for good reason. I put that pressure on myself to get as many people trained as quickly as possible. I addressed some of the backlogs that had previously arisen during Covid, etc. As a place becomes available on a particular course, the student will be offered the next available place. That may not be close to home but they do have the option to refuse that place. They can do that up to three times without any consequence in terms of their allocation or their place in the queue. Sometimes, by doing that they can wait and get a place closer to home. Some apprentices come forward and say they are happy to travel because they want to get through their programme and out the far side and increase their earnings, etc., by doing so. Supports are available in particular circumstances as well, particularly for members of the Traveller community, young people from particularly disadvantaged groups and learners from other under-represented groups in further education. There are some targeted schemes and financial supports available to assist in particular circumstances."

This process should ensure fairness for all apprentices. The Minister has said that himself. Is it fair for apprentices, many of whom are paid below minimum wage and are already paying extra rent, to be forced into living in unregulated digs because of their placement? They also may not even find a place to live and instead have to make long commutes. Once again, let us hope SOLAS rectifies all this for them."

There are different travel allowances available to apprentices to help them in meeting those travel costs. While the issue is a real one, and one which I have asked SOLAS to examine and tackle, there is an induction module for apprentices when they start. Depending on the particular apprenticeship, and I gave the example of the farriers located in Kildare but there are many across the country, it should be known by people entering that these are based in a particular limited location. Equally, some of the larger courses, like those for electricians, plumbers or wood manufacturing, are available more widely and in those cases it is reasonable to expect that a place closer to home would come available. I expect a certain degree on knowledge on the part of the apprentice. Certainly, that should be communicated during the induction stage. Even though there may be a seven-day window to accept or refuse the place, there should have been an awareness of what is likely to arise long before that stage."

On completion of that review which is currently under way, UCC will submit its capital plan to the governing authority in the coming months; I expect it in the new year. Provision of €25 million was made for the business school in 2019 under the higher education strategic infrastructure fund. Approval in principle was granted in 2019 and the total cost of the project at that time was estimated at €105 million, with a delivery of a 17,000 sq. m custom-built business school on a site on Union Quay being examined.",
                    "I understand that the university and the governing authority have full intention and full ambition to develop a world-class business school. They are committed to the project. It will advance. However, value for money is a key consideration. Space utilisation and optimisation in the preferred location must be a feature, as must student access and accessibility, synergy and the ability to leverage other parts of the existing campus. There are a number of considerations that are currently being examined in light of this review but I am assured that the ambition and intention remains to deliver a world-class business college of which the city and the college can be very proud. However, I do not expect that it will be the same proposal as has been previously presented."

This means many universities have a heavy reliance on international students, who pay costly fees towards the Irish university sector, and potentially this is a factor in this project not going ahead. According to the Irish Examiner, the UCC business school plan was reliant on the expected income to the business school coming from international students. The publication also recorded that during the first post-pandemic year of 2022, 52,000 student visas were authorised in the State. That increased to 60,901 last year. According to statistics provided to the Dáil in May, figures for this year are not in yet but the indications are that there has been a drop-off in the number of students, particularly Chinese students, coming here.",

Value for money is a key consideration. UCC is an autonomous body and a very well-run institution with an extremely competent chair, president and board. They have told me they intend to publish their renewed and revised plans early in the new year and we will then see the shape of the new business college. It certainly will be stronger for the process that has been gone through. Throwing good money after bad would not be wise. Proceeding with a project that, at a specification and cost level, may be far in excess of what is appropriate or necessary would not be a wise move. I am speaking hypothetically but I hope the Deputy agrees with me on that principle. I look forward to UCC publishing its revised plans for the business school in 2026. The university will have my full support for the next steps."

It is a landmark moment for Ireland's national research and innovation system. As I am sure the Deputy has done, I have met with various stakeholders from the higher education system, including deans of research and presidents, and members of the research community, including PhD researchers and students, as well as industry representatives and employers, who ultimately will seek to take up the ideas that emerge from research and employ the skilled graduates who flow from the institutions.",

It is a successor to the programme for research in third level institutions, PRTLI, which ran in the first decade of the century and was pivotal in sowing the seeds for the very strong research and innovation ecosystem that was built upon it. It withered on the vine to an extent over the past decade or so, having not been renewed since 2010 or 2011. My party promised a new initiative in this area in our manifesto and it was included in the programme for Government. I was particularly pleased to deliver it in our first year in office.",

That will give them the base layer of equipment they need to perform world-leading, excellent and impactful research. There is another layer for very large-ticket items that are particularly expensive and complex and which one institution may struggle to purchase and manage on its own. The intention is to have a shared infrastructure portal whereby larger items like supercomputers and wire banks can be purchased by one institution and made available to all that want to avail of it. We will have a national management system for that."

Universities are encouraged to put together their own proposals and they will be considered by an expert panel. That panel will be entirely independent and I will not have an involvement in it.

There are some approvals required from other parts of the Government, primarily the Minister for public expenditure, Deputy Chambers. I am working closely with him to finalise the terms and conditions that will attach to those grades. I am confident of resolving this matter before year's end. We are nearly there now but I have been working on it intensely, particularly in recent weeks. That will be a significant milestone. It will give the technological universities the status they deserve and allow professors to be appointed within them, which is necessary for leadership of research projects, enterprise engagement and a status commensurate with their positioning. I am confident we have made significant progress on this in recent weeks. I hope to be able to announce that and get it brought to a conclusion, with agreement from the Government, before the year's end."

They were amalgamated, largely, to form the technological universities we have now. Within the IoTs, the comparative grade was senior lecturer 3. The scales, grades, bands and job titles did not innately map onto the universities'. In some cases, the legacy job titles, conditions and work programmes did not map either. For example, they did not necessarily work over the summer. In a traditional university, a research professor would have a body of work over the summer months. In an IoT, a senior lecturer would typically finish up at the end of the academic term in May and not return until maybe late September. That is a significant difference. It is not just about giving them a new title, but about looking at their work output, the programmes they take on, enterprise engagement and the leadership role they play in the academic sector and that they are more than capable of playing, but it has to be reflected. That is part of this programme of transition as well."

In budget 2026, for example, I secured an additional €10.5 million to increase all non-adjacent maintenance grants under the student grant scheme by at least €200 - in most cases by more. That means all grants for people who are non-adjacent, which means they live 30 km or more from the college, have increased, and in some cases significantly. That is to reflect the fact that those students have an additional financial burden because they are travelling or having to pay for rent or accommodation. Some 30,000 students can avail of that.

As a direct consequence, thousands of students now rely on temporary and often unsuitable arrangements such as staying in family homes, commuting long distances as the Minister acknowledged, or depending on the good will of relatives and friends. We really need to tackle this issue and be more ambitious in creating more student accommodation."

Society is deprived of the nurses, engineers, teachers and researchers that we so badly need in Ireland. Therefore, I ask the Minister to address the following specific points in his response to me. What immediate supports or emergency measures is the Department implementing in this academic year for students who are currently sofa surfing or living in unaffordable private rentals? Will the Government now give serious consideration to the introduction of rent controls or caps specifically for purpose-built accommodation? Is the Minister prepared to commit to a ring-fenced, State-led programme of student bed construction? Will he bring forward, as a matter of urgency, an inflation-adjusted increase in the SUSI maintenance grant and a substantial reform and expansion of the rent a room relief scheme?"

We need to look at the reasons that might be the case. A lot of that comes from viability. I refer to things like the VAT reduction on new apartment building. We will look at the procurement supports that are there and measures we can use to stimulate. Where appropriate, there is funding in the system to make serviced sites available where colleges have sites. They can be encouraged to put them to use for student accommodation to try to get some of those 15,000 beds, and a lot more, unlocked and progressed."

We also saw the students at Youthreach, which is a very critical intervention with youth. From there, I went to Monaghan Institute and finished the day in the Atlantic Technological University, ATU, in Letterkenny, where we launched the new vet school. That, as just a snapshot of a day visiting key sites, shows the activity and investment going on in the north west alone by Youthreach and interventions with disadvantaged learners - giving them an opportunity to succeed - right through to the new professionals being created by the vet school in ATU.

It is unprecedented in recent years. It is a successor programme to the PRTLI, which was successful at the start of the century in driving on our economic position as well. I want to acknowledge that Deputy Smith was a member of the Government in 2010 that committed to the PRTLI programme at a time when economic conditions were difficult, to say the least, and the wolf was at the door. That Government had the foresight and belief to commit to that again. Unfortunately, after that point, it lay fallow for some years until I came to office. It has now been relaunched with a €750 million fund to again drive on our economic prosperity and research and innovation commitment."

Those people did some preparatory work. As a former member of the board of governors of Dundalk Institute of Technology, Senator Diarmuid Wilson was very supportive of the work of Councillor Clifford Kelly and Dr. Michael Mulvey when they were advocating for that all-Ireland cross-Border co-operation when it was not as fashionable as it is today."

There is a very ambitious timetable to make that collaboration come together. I intend to bring legislation through the Houses in the new year to set out the mechanics of how it will be enabled. It is important that Dundalk Institute of Technology continues to enjoy strong autonomy as part of the HEA landscape while being a fully fledged university institute and college of Queen's University with all the powers to award degrees conferred by Queen's University as part of that. Both entities will benefit. Queen's University will also benefit significantly from the collaboration. There are specialties, disciplines and knowledge in each institution that can be shared and benefited from. I always say \"ní neart go cur le chéile\" - we are stronger together and that is evident in this all-Ireland collaboration."

The national student accommodation strategy 2025 to 2035 is due to be published in the coming weeks and will be considered and agreed by Government before being officially launched. It is at a very advanced stage. The strategy aims to make higher education more accessible by addressing both affordability to ensure students can afford rents and secure accommodation and also the viability of supply, which the Deputy's question goes to, to ensure the units come into being quickly and are built out to meet that demand that very evidently exists.",

The strategy builds on wider Government initiatives to support viability of student accommodation such as rental legislation reform where I am working closely with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage on how rent pressure zones might apply to student accommodation; the budget 2026 VAT reduction on the sale of new apartments, which will be very helpful; the rent-a-room tax relief, which is a key measure involving up to €14,000 per householder tax free; and the introduction of streamlined design standards under the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2025. This is a revised set of guidelines published in June 2025 setting out a blueprint for student accommodation that delivers maximum beds per block, uses clever use of space and shared facilities such as lounge rooms and laundry rooms and seeks an optimal return on available bed usage. They are some of the measures I am introducing.",

I was delighted to visit the education and training board that day as well. The breadth of apprenticeships, in particular the wind turbine maintenance apprenticeship and the hospitality apprenticeships, and some of the other courses and skills on display that day were very strong. I thank Councillor Norma Moriarty, who is the chair of the education and training board, who gave a great tour that day. That was particularly interesting. Deputy Cahill mentioned Killarney Technology Innovation Centre. I might get one of my officials to come back to him with details on that. An issue was raised on my visit to the MTU campus in Tralee.

If anybody wants to see how to help to get young men and women into different sectors through traineeships and apprenticeships in a supportive and inclusive way, they need to look at what is happening there. It is an excellent example. I commend the Deputy on mentioning it.",
                    "The question is about expanding apprenticeships and trade-focused education. He specifically mentioned north Dublin. To meet our ambitious housing delivery targets and offshore renewable energy developments over the next decade will require a skilled workforce. Apprenticeships are central to supporting these demands in supplying skilled workers for housing developments, construction and the renewable energy sectors. The programme for Government sets an ambitious target of 12,500 annual apprentice registrations by 2030, with two thirds of those in craft and construction. This reflects the vital role construction plays in infrastructure and economic growth.",
                    "Significant investment underpins this commitment. Budget 2026 saw €79 million allocated to apprenticeship delivery nationally. In addition, my Department recently announced a further €20.5 million capital investment to expand training capacity in higher education institutions, including 39 additional training blocks in TU Dublin. Alongside this investment, my Department's Careers in Construction: Action Plan, launched in 2023, aims to make construction careers more accessible and attractive. That is what the Deputy is speaking about. These efforts are delivering results. We see that craft apprenticeships increased by 63% from 2020 to 2024 and construction-related apprenticeships grew by 50% from 2020 to 2025."

I now see a lot of people going into it when they move abroad, or if they come up, but they need to be shown more. We need to do more advertising to show people because with the development of housing or offshore renewable energy, we will need these skilled workers. It would be much better if we had a native workforce that could be here to continue with any infrastructure project we have. We have a lot of projects to do.",

That is something we need to look into. If the time is longer, it will deter people from apprenticeships."

The Department is very actively involved in a number of programmes to highlight and showcase the attractiveness of apprenticeships. For example, one programme, Facts, Faces, Futures, uses female role models, specifically, to highlight the benefit aspects of apprenticeships. That is run by the national apprenticeship office. We have a large social media campaign, Building Heroes, which takes what is called a peer-to-peer approach to dispel some of the myths surrounding apprenticeships. I have met many of the young people involved in this. It is a really positive programme to show that apprenticeships are for everybody."

There are a lot of derelict sites in north Dublin that could be upgraded and used as an apprenticeship college. There are ones we could invest in. We need to show, north Dublin especially, that there are other options for these kids and future adults, as the Minister of State said, and that this is not a plan B or C. It should be considered a plan A. I welcome what she said about social media. We need to continue actively promoting apprenticeships as first-choice career routes. Centres such as St. Andrew's, as the Minister of State mentioned, demonstrate that when training is practical, supportive and connected it helps people succeed in their career going forward. I welcome its inclusive model. I hope it can be used as a blueprint across the country."

Certainly, a lot the programmes the Department is progressing are attempting to do that. I mentioned the Facts, Faces, Futures and Building Heroes programmes. We also have the Build Back Home programme, which is an international programme aimed at skilled Irish construction workers living abroad to try to entice them back, specifically from Canada and Australia. The Department is making real efforts to, first of all, entice workers back to Ireland but, equally, to get more and more students to take the apprenticeship pathway. One of the ways we are trying to do that is through modern methods of construction, MMC. We have a Skillnet MMC Accelerate platform, launched in May this year, which highlights MMC projects and how students can avail of what is available."

At present, University College Cork admits around 50 students annually to its dentistry programme, split evenly between Irish or EU students and non-EU students. In consultation with the Department of Health, which has advised that dentistry is an area requiring an additional supply of graduates, we are working to expand opportunities for Irish students, particularly given the demands for oral healthcare and the need to reduce waiting lists in the south west of the country.",

It also supports a community-based model of education giving students earlier clinical exposure in primary care settings which enhances readiness to enter practice when they graduate.

The cost of that is approximately €4.6 million. The submission for that was made in 2022.

We previously had over 1,250 dentists working privately and providing care for people who had medical cards. The number of dentists in that area is down to 600. Likewise, the number of dentists employed directly by the HSE has dropped from over 300 in 2014 to 250. That is in the context of a huge growth in population. We have huge challenges in the dental area. The other issue relates to schools. In the programme where dentists visit schools and provide advice to students, the number of students being seen has dropped dramatically. I had parents contact me in the past week whose children first saw a dentist in secondary school. We need to increase the numbers so we can deal with the growing demand."

It has played a central role in promoting mobility, strengthening intercultural understanding and expanding exciting opportunities for learners. Last year, more than 6,200 Irish higher education students participated in Erasmus, with strong engagement across schools, vocational education and training, youth and sport. I expect that trend to continue in an upward direction as the programme evolves. There is an emerging shape of the new Erasmus programme from 2028 to 2034."

It is a very exciting and historic proposal. This will be the first all-island university, which speaks to many of our aspirations about our shared island and all-island dimensions. It is a programme that will enhance both DkIT and Queen's University. The partnership will include an integration of DkIT within the academic framework of Queen's University, ensuring that students studying in Dundalk will graduate with a Queen's University award. It also envisages a joint research and innovation centre on the Dundalk campus, which will be a close collaboration with enterprise and industry as part of a research and industry foundational partnership.",
                    "It will further strengthen regional development in the north east and along the Dublin-Belfast corridor. It also places a full university education within reach of students in the north east, perhaps filling a gap that may have existed previously between Dublin and Belfast. With this partnership, university education will be accessible and available to students in Dundalk. Of course, student mobility skills development and shared learning are part of that as well.",
                    "It is worth noting that the proposal will see DkIT, while becoming a college of Queen's University, remain an autonomous, self-governing university college and retain its rights. It is part of a new model within the Irish higher education landscape. It is a slightly different model from other technological universities and my expectation is it will require legislation. I hope the Deputy and his party will support that, as I imagine they will, and that others in the House will support it too. There is a very exciting and ambitious timetable for it, which I certainly intend to do my best to work with."

Not so long ago, I also attended the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly in Surrey, which I think the Deputy attended as well. We have had some really constructive conversations with stakeholders in the North and the UK on things like UCAS and the CAO, in respect of which there is some alignment, and in terms of A levels versus the leaving certificate and so on. There are a number of differences but I think differences can be overcome, and these are details that we can work through. I would not want that to stop and I know the Deputy is of the same mind.

This announcement builds upon my Department's consistent focus and progression on this issue. That came into effect from 1 January this year and, given the significant growth in such a short space of time, I have no immediate plans to increase the figure further.

Put simply, those agencies under my remit and my Department and in receipt of funding from Research Ireland are providing the €25,000 stipend. There may be other funders outside the remit of my Department which have their own arrangements, but certainly they are all encouraged, at least, to reach that threshold.

It should be a minimum requirement and €25,000 is also, frankly, poverty wages. It is a stipend, of course, so those in receipt of it do not get any of the normal benefits associated with working even though they are workers. In fact, I met with AMLÉ and the Postgraduate Workers Association during the week and one of their biggest demands was to be treated as workers, as is the case in other countries. This Government often goes on about research and development but, compared with their international counterparts, including in Germany and the Netherlands and best practice in the rest of Europe, our researchers, the people who actually do the front-line research and teach people in our higher level education institutions and universities, are treated terribly.

In a cost of living crisis and with the cost of accommodation, it is poverty level and they do not get any of the benefits because it is a stipend, even though in reality it is work. They do not get maternity leave, sick pay or any of the normal benefits workers would receive, even though their counterparts in the Netherlands and Germany get much higher wages and are treated as workers, with a sliding scale of wages. That is good treatment of researchers, whereas ours are living in poverty in the most precarious of situations. I contrast it with the fact that hundreds of millions of euro extra were given out in the research and development tax credit during the budget. The big winners were the big corporations. The research and development tax credit is now up to €1.4 billion, with most of that going to a small number of multinationals. A small portion of that money could lift our PhD researchers out of poverty. Will the Minister address the fact that these PhD researchers who keep our system going are living in poverty?"

That ultimately is what creates the resources, jobs and enterprise and, indeed, creates the tax intake that allows us to deliver the public good in other ways. Many of our PhD students may well aspire to work for those same institutions when they complete their education, and many of them may do so in actuality. I would not make any assumptions as to the recipients of that funding. I worked in the sector before I was in political life and a number of smaller institutions, including indigenous ones, also availed of those kinds of supports.",

That is a corollary to bear in mind on that."

This project is to examine transitions into further and higher education, to map out the supports and services available to students with disabilities within the further and higher education systems and to develop new approaches to supporting students as they move into employment following college. The latter is perhaps a gap at the moment. That transition to the workforce is essential. I have met many groups both in my constituency and around the country, and the point is often made to me that, even with the additional supports and pathways through education, the transition to the workforce can be challenging. There is an intention to encompass further supports for people to make that transition. That is very much on my mind and the Department's mind as we role out this plan further.",

That is a sort of gap analysis that will help to map out where to go to, the next stage. That work is expected to commence in 2026, and it is a very important piece of work."

                    "I think this is the third time this week that I have risen to talk about support for arts and cultural spaces, not only here in Dublin but across the country. Since I came into the Houses five years ago, and I am sure Deputy Boyd Barrett is the exact same, I have spoken out about the closure of arts spaces and studios, particularly here in Dublin, because the reality is that culture cannot compete with capitalism. We have seen a hollowing out of arts and culture spaces across our city over the past two decades. We have counted over 52 spaces that have been forced to close. The reality is that there is a lack of State support for these vital spaces that are intrinsic to the cultural fabric of our communities and our city. While the context for my question is about The Complex in Dublin 7, the heart of my constituency, a really important multidisciplinary space home to art studios and an arts or performance space, and the plea for help to keep that space open, there is a wider context as to how State policy supports these facilities across the country.",
                    "I said earlier to Deputy O'Donovan, the Minister with responsibility in this area, that he has made some very positive noises about wanting to support the development of arts spaces across the country, but I also note he talks about developing a scheme along the lines of the sports capital grants. That is great in some ways, but the reality, as any of us here in Dublin know, is that you need to be able to own the building or have a long-term lease on it in order to be able to access funding. The State needs to do more than that. It needs to step in and either ensure cultural mortgages or purchase or co-purchase of buildings with arts organisations."

We have an amazing pool of artists, poets, writers, musicians and dancers. You can go through the list. Nowhere exemplifies that more than an institution such as The Complex, which has been in the north inner city for 17 years. The north inner city, and the northside of Dublin city generally, does not have much by way of arts venues. As has been referenced by Deputy Sherlock, many of these spaces have closed down. There are 30 artists in residence in The Complex. Hundreds of musicians, artists and so on use it. There have been 180 events just this year in The Complex. There are staff and hundreds of people whose employment is linked to The Complex. They are going to be evicted and effectively closed down in early January for the want of €6 million. The Complex does not even need that money immediately. It will need it over four years. It needs a commitment from the Government to save this venue. That is a small amount of money for a Government that has a big budget surplus. The Complex is looking for a commitment. It does not want a game of pass-the-parcel between the Department of arts, the Department of Finance and the Office of Public Works, OPW. It wants a commitment to work with the other agencies, including Dublin City Council, the Department of arts and the other relevant Departments. It engaged with the former Deputy, Paschal Donohoe, when he was Minister for Finance, and the Minister for public expenditure, Deputy Chambers, and believed it was going to get the help it needed, but it is now facing D-day. A crisis meeting is happening tonight. It has huge local support. I ask the Minister of State to please intervene and save The Complex."

As outlined in the programme for Government, we recognise that they are essential to a well-rounded society, providing opportunities for education, expression and community engagement.",
                    "As the Deputies are aware, The Complex is a multidisciplinary arts and creative venue in Dublin's north inner city, governed by a not-for-profit company limited by guarantee. The Complex has been leasing its building, a former fruit warehouse off Capel Street, from a private landlord on a site ring-fenced for redevelopment. It is my understanding that the centre has been in negotiations with the developer for a partnership in which The Complex would be given the opportunity to buy back two floors. The Complex CLG has, in principle, secured a loan of €1.5 million towards the purchase. I understand that The Complex has stated that talks took place with the Department of Finance, the Department of public expenditure and reform and Dublin City Council to assist with the finance of this offer, after an initial business case was undertaken by Forvis Mazars. However, as Members will be aware, the Department of Culture, Communications and Sport was not part of this engagement. The Department provides grants as a contribution towards maintaining and enhancing existing arts and culture facilities but does not provide funding for the purchase of any property. The provision of local arts and cultural infrastructure is, as Deputy Sherlock heard this morning, a matter in the first instance for local authorities. Officials from the Department met with the chair of The Complex and other members of the team in December 2024 and advised them of this position. Further communication in June 2025 reiterated that position.",
                    "In any event, no funding was sought from this Department for the purchase of the building by The Complex. I am informed that any grant for refurbishment support would require chargeable title to be in place. It is my information that at present, The Complex has been given notice to quit in January 2026. As we have heard and as the Deputies have articulated quite eloquently, I am sure that this is a matter of huge distress not just for the staff and the board but for all of the artists who use The Complex on a regular basis and others.",
                    "While I understand that negotiations are still ongoing with the developer, I am informed that the CEO, Ms Vanessa Fielding, has written to the Department advising that they will be looking for a meaningful space to move into should there not be a positive outcome to those discussions. While the Department does not own any properties and is, therefore, not in a position to assist The Complex in this regard, it is my hope that Dublin City Council may be able to assist in this matter.",
                    "The Minister, Deputy O'Donovan, is acutely aware of the pressures that artists and creatives face in finding suitable workplaces and workspaces, especially here in our capital city. The lack of space has been a significant barrier for artists, limiting their ability to create and exhibit work. The Department recognises that local authorities can play a vital role in delivering the infrastructure necessary to provide a number of artists' workspaces nationwide. That was why, in 2023, the Department allocated €3 million in funding to Space to Create, an initiative that aims to provide up to 60 artist workspaces in Dublin city, in partnership with Dublin City Council.",
                    "In addition, the Department launched the artist workspaces scheme in June 2024. That is a €6 million pilot capital funding scheme for local authorities to increase the provision of artists' workspaces across Ireland. The primary focus of this pilot scheme is to provide funding to local authorities to enable them to provide additional capacity and availability of artist workspaces in their regions on a sustainable basis. Local authorities are invited to propose projects which can accommodate and address the demand for artist workspaces in their regions and produce workspaces that are fit for purpose, design-focused and accessible.",
                    "I hear what the Members are saying. I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister and will articulate their views to him. I understand that the reply does not give them the answer they desire but I am aware that, as the Deputies know, the Department is genuinely looking for a satisfactory resolution. I hope there will be resolution. Mar fhocal scoir, gabhaim buíochas leis na Teachtaí as ucht an t-ábhar tábhachtach seo a chur chun cinn."

As previously stated, the Minister is acutely aware of the pressure that artists and creatives face in finding suitable workspaces, in particular here in our capital city. I agree that the lack of space has been a significant barrier and is a source of frustration as it limits the ability to create and exhibit work, in particular. The Department has two schemes to support local authorities across the country to provide for additional capacity and availability of artists' workspaces in the regions on a sustainable basis. In this instance, I am informed that the Department is not in a position to provide funding for the purchase of the property that has been mentioned. It is important, as Deputy Boyd Barrett said, that arising from tonight's meeting there is ongoing negotiation and consultation. I will bring the Deputies' views back to the Department and I thank them for raising the matter."

It is the future of volunteering in Ireland and the need for a national volunteering strategy that delivers for communities and for the country. I applaud my local volunteer centre in Louth. It does incredible work. Our volunteer centre recorded 40,000 volunteering hours last year, an equivalent of €1.2 million in economic value.",
                    "The team in Louth, like many across the country, is outperforming the investment the State provides. It is navigating staff absences for sickness, or whatever, rising operational pressures and a funding model that does not match the output. Some centres receive significantly higher allocations than others with the same or even fewer numbers of volunteers. This kind of disparity undermines the very idea of a national strategy.",
                    "Let us be honest, in that the last national volunteering strategy did leave a lot of gaps. We still do not have unified data tracking despite 29 centres independently collecting their own figures. We still do not have common key performance indicators, KPIs, making national comparisons impossible. We still have not invested in the kinds of modern system that would allow us to capture, measure and communicate the true value of volunteering. When proposals were made, like reviewing the national database or creating shared staffing supports, these did not progress. We need clarity because volunteer centres cannot plan on the basis of guesswork.",
                    "There have been positives. The Louth Volunteer Centre received €70,000 from the community recognition fund to purchase a minibus, which is something genuinely transformative for outreach and mobility. These are exactly the types of focused, practical support that work. Isolated wins, though, cannot replace structural reform. There is talk about innovation and volunteering is changing. People want flexible roles, skills-based roles, short-term opportunities and digital volunteering options. Centres are eager to pilot these ideas, but without a dedicated volunteering innovation fund, good ideas remain stuck in the \"maybe someday\" drawer. This is not how we future-proof a sector. Volunteering is not just a hobby for Ireland; it is a core pillar of community life. This applies to our festivals, sports clubs, Tidy Towns groups and local response organisations. Volunteering keeps people connected, develops skills and strengthens local cohesion at a time when this is badly needed.",
                    "I am asking the Minister of State to set out how the new national volunteering strategy will deliver fair and transparent resources across all volunteer centres, if it will introduce a standardised national reporting framework with common KPIs, if it will include a dedicated innovation fund to support modernisation, and how the Department intends to ensure staffing stability, including temporary cover, when absences arise. The people running these centres are doing phenomenal work with limited tools. I know the Minister of State has engaged heavily with them. They are delivering far more than their funding suggests. What they need from us now is ambition. This ambition needs to be backed by those resources, clarity and the new strategy that will be implemented. Ireland's volunteer sector is one of our greatest national assets. It is something we should be really very proud of and we should really treat it like it is a national asset."

                    "I thank Deputy McGreehan for raising this very important matter. I thank her for speaking up, advocating on behalf of volunteering and referring to the forthcoming second national volunteering strategy. As the Deputy rightly said, in Irish society volunteering is part of who we are. It is woven into our communities, our culture and our sense of identity. From the GAA pitch to the soccer pitch to the parish hall and from community gardens to climate action, people living in Ireland have always understood that a strong society is built not only by Government or policy, but by people who look out for one another - our volunteers. The gift given by volunteers is priceless. It changes people’s lives for the better and makes our country and our communities, as the Deputy said, a haven and a place to call home. Volunteering keeps our communities resilient, compassionate and hopeful.",
                    "As Members will know, the first national volunteering strategy was launched in December 2020. It was developed in collaboration with stakeholders from the sector across the country. It is a whole-of-government framework to support volunteers, their representative groups and a range of not-for-profit organisations. It comprises five strategic objectives with 56 associated actions aimed at achieving its vision of \"a society where volunteering is [not just] promoted, [but is] valued, facilitated and supported so that people can contribute to developing and maintaining vibrant, inclusive and sustainable communities\". The Government has allocated increased funding each year to implement the strategy. Funding has risen from €3.1 million in 2020 to €7.3 million last year. This includes core funding for the network of volunteer centres across Ireland, and for Volunteer Ireland, a national advocacy body. Funding is also made available each year to support capacity building in volunteer-involving organisations, and to carry out research and projects to support the implementation of actions in that strategy. Additional supports for volunteering were provided during the Covid-19 pandemic and additional funding for the volunteering response to the Ukraine crisis, broadened to include integration generally, has been provided since 2022, with €1 million provided each year in 2023, 2024 and 2025.",
                    "As the first strategy comes to a close, and having engaged with the sector and met Volunteer Ireland, I note there is a commitment in the programme for Government to publishing a second national volunteering strategy. Our Department of Rural and Community Development and the Gaeltacht is currently working to develop that new strategy. A review of the approach taken in the first strategy has been commissioned from TASC, the Think-tank for Action on Social Change. That work is ongoing and is focused on consultation with the community and voluntary sector and other stakeholders. That is well under way. This continues the collaboration and co-operation that has characterised the current national volunteering strategy. I hope we will have a second one as well. I heard the remarks made by Deputy McGreehan and I will certainly feed them back into the review.",
                    "Our Department has supported volunteer centres across the country to consult with their volunteers and volunteer-led organisations and officials. We have seen officials from our Department travel across the country to receive feedback and input from each of the volunteer centres. Deputy McGreehan is right. She referred to County Louth, but the volume and value of what is being done by our volunteer centres across the country is extraordinary.",
                    "In addition to what I referred to already, meetings have also been held with national stakeholder organisations, including Volunteer Ireland, the Local Development Companies Network, Comhlámh and the Irish League of Credit Unions, among others, to hear their views. Officials are collaborating with The Wheel and Sport Ireland to consult with their many stakeholder groups on priorities for the new strategy. In conjunction with the Department of Children, Disability and Equality, young people involved in Comhairle na nÓg have also been consulted to gather their views on the issues. To ensure that the new strategy is a cross-governmental policy, a series of bilateral meetings will be held with Departments to ensure volunteering under each area is reflected.",
                    "In conclusion, while the process of consultation is still under way, I do not wish, as Minister of State with responsibility for volunteering, to anticipate the areas that may be focused on in the new strategy. I can guarantee to Deputy McGreehan, however, that the second strategy will build on the progress we have made through the first one, strengthening our long-established volunteering infrastructure and continuing to progress areas of best practice to ensure that support for and recognition of the value of volunteering is sustainable into the future."

There are many different skills that we need now, including digital skills for community groups, sports clubs, etc. An incredible amount of intellectual capacity in our communities. If we provide the framework for people to be able to deliver those to community groups, sports clubs, etc., I think we can be hugely successful.",

I say this constantly: if the volunteers in Ireland stopped working, the nation would be at a standstill. From Covid to flag days to looking after Ukrainian and other refugees across the country, it is volunteerism that brings us together and raises us up. It is a core pillar of our community life and brings people together. Every single cent is well spent. As I said, 40,000 volunteering hours were contributed in County Louth last year and this was the equivalent of €1.3 million of an investment. I am sure that not even a percentage of that amount was delivered by the Government to volunteering in Louth."

Again, I express my appreciation, and that of everyone in the House, for the huge work and contribution being made by volunteers across the country.

It has made up a huge amount of my work over the last number of weeks. People in Chapelizod, Palmerstown and Islandbridge are absolutely at their wits' end with the 80 bus route that came into being in the middle of October. I have held two very large public meetings in that time. In fact, the first one was so large that I had to divide it into two groups. I took one group of people first while the other group waited outside and then I had the other meeting. There was a protest a few weeks later and then another meeting that was attended by over 100 people. This issue is affecting people's lives to a huge extent.",
                    "The former 26 bus service was the only bus route from Chapelizod into town. The bus used to go in all the way along the quays. I do not know whether the Minister of State is familiar with the area, but the bus used to go all the way along the quays to Bachelor's Walk and then cross over to Merrion Square. The route was changed and the bus now goes over to Palmerstown Park. As one person said, people do not want to go to Palmerstown Park because they live beside the Phoenix Park. Why would they want to go over there? There was so much pressure put on the NTA that there was a meeting with all public representatives in the area. The NTA said it would move the 130 service that comes from Clontarf and it could go out that way but people in Chapelizod, Islandbridge and Palmerstown do not want to go to Clontarf either. They want the route that they had that was working, albeit not perfectly, and meeting their needs. They had a huge protest a couple of Saturdays ago and are having another one this Saturday because they want the 26 back. They want it back because it worked although, as I said, it was not perfect.",
                    "I want to give the Minister of State an idea of what is happening for the people of Chapelizod. Mothers have been waiting for over an hour. One woman with a new baby and a toddler waited for an hour in lashing rain and then missed her GP appointment. There are children going in the opposite direction, out of town, who are getting detention because they are late for school so now parents are back in their cars, bringing them to school. There are people going to work who used to take 45 minutes to get in or to get home but it is now taking them over two hours. Quite frankly, they could walk from town to Chapelizod in less time if they were able to but the footpaths and cycle path are also a disgrace. My son goes to sports out in that direction and I had reason to cycle there to the protest recently and the footpaths and cycle paths are not fit for purpose and very dark. However, that is a side issue for today.",
                    "This is the Christmas period and I was speaking to a person earlier this week who told me that a number of people are missing out on Christmas activities and festivities because they just cannot get the bus back and forth. People with disabilities are being let down. It is an unmitigated disaster. The NTA told us at that recent meeting that the 80 route is still within the 2% margin for buses that do not turn up or are late but that is not the data that we have collected. It is 9% or 10% on a good day. When buses are not turning up and are not reliable, it affects people's lives. The previous contributor spoke about volunteers. All of these people have their busy, normal days and then they are in a situation where they have to spend their evenings and weekends protesting for a very simple public service that they pay for. It is not even that it is free; they are paying for it. They are so frustrated. I pay tribute to them because they have come out on dark, cold, rainy nights to public meetings and to protests. They have been mobilising and they should not have to do that. They had their Christmas tree lighting ceremony recently and the atmosphere was not as jolly as it could have been because their energies are going into the wrong things. They have a lovely community there and that is where their energies should be going.",

                    "On 28 November, following customer feedback and engagement with public representatives, the NTA announced a two-stage plan to revise route 80. I have heard everything Deputy Cummins said this afternoon and am aware that my reply may not give her and the residents the solace they seek. I am informed that from early 2026, route 80 will operate from Liffey Valley to Chapelizod on a revised alignment along the quays, crossing the Liffey at O'Connell Bridge rather than Bridge Street, and running through College Green to South Great George’s Street. This temporary measure will improve access to the city centre ahead of the planned pedestrianisation of College Green. Later, in quarter 2 of 2026, route 80 will link with route 130, continuing along the north quays and O’Connell Bridge to Eden Quay and northward through the city centre to Clontarf. This alignment will maintain a ten-minute peak frequency and provide new connectivity to the Luas green line at O’Connell Street and the DART at Connolly Station, offering passengers more options for onward travel. I am aware that the Luas green line is not operational today which is causing bother for commuters and I apologise to them. The NTA acknowledges that for a variety of reasons, including city centre congestion, route 80 did not meet expectations following its introduction. When rolling out phases of the BusConnects network, the NTA commits to monitoring new services, identifying issues, and implementing fixes where appropriate. These changes reflect that commitment.",
                    "In planning the redesigned network, the NTA considered Dublin City Council’s plans to transform College Green and Dame Street into a pedestrian-friendly plaza, which will restrict east-west bus movements through College Green. This was why route 80 was originally routed via Bridge Street. However, customer feedback indicated that continuing along the quays to O’Connell Bridge would provide greater benefits, including improved bus priority measures and enhanced connectivity to O’Connell Street and onward transport services. The NTA has reviewed this feedback and agrees that the changes make sense. While the NTA considered terminating route 80 at Merrion Square, replicating the former route 26, it concluded that linking routes 80 and 130 offers greater benefits, including improved interchange to bus, Luas, and rail services, and better access to the docklands and Connolly Station. Those travelling to Merrion Square will continue to have multiple onward connection options."

People are just waiting there and it is a complete and utter waste of time. However, the issue is that there was no public consultation about changing the route to include the 130.

I will be bringing this issue up again because there is still frustration. I am not sure the solution the NTA has provided is going to be acceptable to the community. In fact, I know it will not be because they are out protesting again on Saturday."

This would obviously create jobs across the south east but it would also ensure the State can meet its climate action targets. I have met the chairman and representatives of the port several times over the last number of years. They have very ambitious targets and plans. They are looking for State support. Like Rosslare Europort, it is a very important asset for the south east. I know Rosslare Europort also has plans in respect of offshore renewable energy but the two ports complement each other because the Port of Waterford is seeking to support offshore wind turbine staging, assembly and maintenance operations. It is seeking to create a regional supply chain ecosystem for marine engineering, fabrication and component servicing. Investment in the port and in offshore renewable energy is important for job creation and skills development in renewable technologies and maritime logistics.",
                    "I have also spoken to the president of the South East Technological University, SETU. There is collaboration between a number of State agencies in relation to the Port of Waterford as well. If you have an offshore renewable energy terminal and offshore renewable energy potential, with Rosslare Europort and the Port of Waterford playing their different parts in that, there will also be huge potential for research and development. That is where the links to SETU come in. Courses there could lead to the creation of very high-quality jobs in the south east for graduates coming out of this regional university.",
                    "This is a no-brainer. When I met the port representatives, they were very enthusiastic about this. They want it to work. They know how important renewable energy is. Whether people like it or not, we all know that we are going to have to move away from dirty fuels. Renewable energy is the future. Smart countries, smart regions and smart investors are making those investments. The south east wants to be ahead of the curve and it wants to be part of that. The people I have spoken to in this area and in the port say that there is potential for hundreds of millions of euro of investment over a number of years if the right decisions are made.",

I have received PowerPoint presentations and other presentations from the board. Together with our MEP, Kathleen Funchion, my party leader and I visited the port and got a similar presentation. The port is certainly up and at it, lobbying and looking for funding, but it does not seem to be getting the funding that other ports have got. Will the Minister of State respond to that point and set out his perspective on the Government's plans to support the Port of Waterford and, indeed, Rosslare Europort? The Government should look at the whole region, those two ports and linkages with SETU as a really big opportunity for the south east to be a leader in offshore renewable energy. The ports and university could complement one another, create high-quality jobs and assist the State in meeting its crucial climate action targets."

In 2021, the Government recognised the need for additional port infrastructure in a policy statement on the facilitation of offshore renewable energy, ORE, by commercial State ports in Ireland. This policy statement sets out that a number of ports will be required for deployment activity and a multiple will be required for operations and maintenance activities. The Government endorses a multiport approach to offshore renewable energy deployment on the basis that this will maximise the attractiveness of Ireland for offshore renewable energy industry stakeholders seeking to invest.",

The port will also provide new quayside operator support facilities with workshops and warehouses, berthing pontoons and two separate three-storey office and staff buildings for offshore renewable energy operators. This will allow the port to act in a supporting role for the construction of offshore wind farms, particularly through the storage of ancillary components for offshore wind, such as subsea cables. The marshalling and assembly of large-scale components, such as foundations, blades and tower sections, is expected to take place in other ports.",

The first auction for the south coast designated maritime area plan, SC-DMAP, for the Tonn Nua site took place in November. This auction successfully procured 900 MW of ORE capacity to be delivered by ESB and Ørsted, marking a significant milestone in Ireland's offshore renewable energy ambitions.",

This is expected to bolster the case for investment in ports infrastructure and enhance the viability of ORE port facilities such as those at the Port of Waterford.",
                    "The port is also ideally positioned to support phase 1 of offshore renewable energy development currently in the planning system. The national ORE DMAP, due by 2027, will further enhance the case for investment. The objective of the national DMAP is to designate sufficient maritime area to deliver a target of 20 GW of offshore renewable energy by 2040, inclusive of the 5 GW target for 2030.",
                    "Regarding investment in the Port of Waterford, the current national ports policy does not allow for direct Exchequer funding for ports. However, as Deputy Cullinane knows, this policy is currently under review. I am aware the Department plans to conduct a public consultation on a draft version of the revised national ports policy in quarter 4 of this year, subject to the completion of the relevant associated environmental assessment of the draft documentation. Once complete, it is hoped to bring the revised NPP to Government in the first quarter of next year. Again, I thank Deputy Cullinane for highlighting the importance of the Port of Waterford.

Again, it would a statement of intent by Government and by the Department. There is a working group in place and I support and welcome that, but at this point it needs to be established into a much clearer multi-agency task force that can start to co-ordinate the planning, infrastructural investment and stakeholder engagement. It also needs to look at what will be needed down the road, which is a targeted funding stream for all of the upgrades and the buildings the Minister of State cited in his contribution. It also allows SETU to work with the port to invest in skills and training programmes for the south east. Therefore, there is a lot of potential, but the potential will only be realised if all of the stakeholders are working to a plan, which is why having a task force, with all of those stakeholders working to a strategy, makes sense.",

Let us get the work done and make sure, if the planning application is successful, that we can then immediately secure the funding and start the works needed."

                    "I thank Deputy Cullinane again. I reiterate that Government remains committed to supporting our commercial State ports, including the Port of Waterford, in their plans to build enabling infrastructure for ORE. It is my understanding that the Department of Transport has established the ORE ports co-ordination group to facilitate discussion with both the commercial State ports and other ports and updates in the ORE sector. This group provides a forum for the Department to provide both Government and industry with presentations on the sectors and on the ports and allows the ports to raise any issues that may be of interest or concern to them that they may be encountering in their projects in their ports. This is in addition to the Department's role as a key member of the offshore wind delivery task force, which is chaired by the Minister for Transport and the recently established ORE Government clearing house hub, which is chaired by an Taoiseach. The Department is actively engaged with industry stakeholders with a view to maximising all potential financing options for ports, which includes financing partners such as the European Investment Bank, the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, and the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.",
                    "Regarding our national ports policy, it is important to recognise that the draft is due for a second phase of public consultation very soon. I, as Minister of State, and all of my colleagues will welcome submissions from all interested parties on the development of a national ports policy during a second phase of the consultation. The point we are making is that the proposed developments at the Port of Waterford will build upon developments, for example, in the Port of Cork, link with the proposed developments in Rosslare Europort, and would provide us as a country with significant port infrastructure to allow us to meet our ambitious ORE targets. I assure the Deputy that we will be committed to this and Government will work with all the different interests. I thank him for raising the matter because it is a very important point."

                    "Some 33% of the population of Balbriggan is aged 17 years or under. We call it the youngest town in Ireland because the facts back us up. It is a town that is blessed, and I want to say blessed, with a very vibrant, young population. A report was conducted recently on the spaces and youth services in Balbriggan and young people themselves had an opportunity to tell us what they were thinking and what they needed. What they say they need and what they want are safe spaces, places where they can be and hang out. Not every young person plays sport. There is not always something but they do not want to hang around either. They want to have somewhere to be where they can be safe and where they can hang out.",
                    "I was in Foróige in Balbriggan recently for Oíche na hÓige and I spoke to Aisling O'Connell, Antoinette Kelly and Amanda Cullen about the work they are doing. I am a big fan of the work done by Foróige workers, as I sure the Minister of State is himself. I have seen what they do and the real difference they make in people's lives. I cannot understand why, in the youngest town in Ireland, funding for youth work and youth services is going entirely in the wrong direction. For example, we recently lost three youth workers. That is 100 to 150 young people who need services and support who will not now be in a position to get it. The funding for youth work in Dublin is barely meeting the baseline for existing levels of service. When you have a growing population, even maintaining existing levels of service means you are going to fall behind. The Government is not even doing that. That issue about underfunding for youth work is more acutely felt in towns like Balbriggan where we have a large population of young people. Looking at the NDP, we see that youth services could, at the very best, be described as the poor relation.",
                    "We say on the one hand that we do not want young people hanging around. If they hang around too much we tell them that is causing antisocial behaviour. They get lectured eight days a week by people like me and, with no disrespect to the Minister of State, like him about spending too much time on screens, but if we are not giving them a viable option, what other choice do they have? I recently had two graduates of the Leadership for Life programme run by Foróige doing work experience in my office and they blew me away. When I spoke to them, a lot of the confidence they had and the capacity to come into a place like this to spend a couple of days working came from the input from the people in Foróige. I am concerned that, in a town like Balbriggan, Foróige workers needs permanent places to be. They need multi-annual funding and they need to know when they start a programme, like the UBU programme that they can keep running it. Amanda needs to know, when she starts the UBU programme, that she is going to be able to run it again and keep running it. That requires a dedicated funding stream.",
                    "Will the Minister of State please ask the Minister, Deputy Naughton, to come to Balbriggan and visit Foróige? There is a new place going to be opening in Castlelands Community Centre, but if she could visit the existing premises, meet some of the young people and see the good work is being done, that would inform her work a bit better."

It targets young people in the age group of ten to 24 years who are identified as marginalised, vulnerable and at risk of not flourishing. The scheme provides a foundation for local youth organisations to deliver tailored supports that meet the needs of their communities. Last year, €51 million was allocated to the scheme, with more than €9 million going to Dublin and Dún Laoghaire ETB for its delivery.",
                    "The Deputy rightly praised Foróige in Balbriggan. As Minister of State with responsibility for community development, I will happily visit the organisation with her. It is delivering the UBU project from the Castlemill Education Centre. Everyone here, including the Ceann Comhairle, will pay tribute and testify to the importance of Foróige. In the case of the Balbriggan branch, it delivers needs-based, targeted youth services that support young people in their social, personal and educational development.",
                    "For me, as Minister of State and as a former teacher, it is all about young people. The Deputy referenced screens but it is about more than just screens. It is about ensuring the safe spaces, positive relationships and meaningful opportunities young people deserve and need can be provided in order that they can grow, develop and flourish. The strength of the UBU project lies in having a place-based and needs-led approach. It is also about the tailoring of services, including in Balbriggan, to allow young people to be supported and empowered. We are all struck by the power of young people. I join the Deputy in praising and supporting the senior youth worker and the two other youth workers in Balbriggan for their engagement, commitment to inclusion, helping to give young people a sense of resilience and confidence and teaching them skills, not just for life but also to go on to work and further education.",
                    "To underpin that work, the Department allocated €142,560 in UBU funding to Foróige Balbriggan last year. Recognising that organisations often face additional pressures, the Department also operates the Resilience and Effectiveness initiative. This measure is designed to strengthen UBU-funded organisations by addressing specific challenges, whether financial or operational, and enabling them to expand service provision where demand is high. Last year, Foróige Balbriggan received an additional €60,417 under this initiative, following a recommendation from Dublin and Dún Laoghaire ETB. In addition to Foróige, the Department also funds Remember Us Balbriggan under the UBU scheme. Remember Us provides a vital service for young people aged ten to 24 in the north Dublin area.",
                    "The Deputy has a copy of my reply, so I will not use the time remaining to me to go through the rest of it. The point I want to make is that there is more that unites us than divides us on this important issue. I will convey the Deputy's views to the Minister. I hope the Department will actively continue to review and strengthen youth work services across the country to ensure they are responsive to the evolving needs of young people, including in Balbriggan, and that they are effectively resourced to enable them to provide the positive outcomes for young people that they deserve."

That is the key here. We must ensure there are safe permanent spaces where young people can access services. We must ensure youth workers are properly funded. We also must ensure things like auto-enrolment are catered for in the funding because that is a right those workers have as much as everybody else. While I absolutely welcome the money that has been given to date, there is a growing need and the budget must grow with that need."

                "I move: “That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"",
                "I am not surprised the Government has indicated that it will oppose the Bill. The previous Government signed up to Sláintecare a number of years ago. I was always suspicious of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael signing up to a plan that delivers universal healthcare and seeks to streamline and reduce waiting lists. I contrast that ambition with the evidence of almost 1 million people currently on some form of waiting list, if we include acute, community, diagnostics and so on. In the past, my party put forward clear plans for an integrated waiting list management system. We had some favourable responses at the time from Simon Harris when he was Minister for Health but, of course, they never saw the light of day. It is troubling but not surprising that the Government will oppose this straightforward but very important legislation.",
                "The Bill seeks to do things: first, to acknowledge that waiting lists are too long and, second, to bring a degree of transparency to those lists that does not currently exist. Going back to what I said a few moments ago, almost every Member of the Oireachtas at the time Sláintecare was put in place signed up to that plan. We signed up to a roadmap, in essence, to deliver universal healthcare. It also set statutory timeframes for waiting lists that we are absolutely nowhere near meeting. I raised directly with the Minister for Health a number of weeks ago the situation with even very basic daycare procedures in my constituency of Waterford.",
                "Patients come into my office almost daily for cataract, hip or hernia operations - very basic procedures. When I contact local hospital management, they say, unfortunately, the person could be waiting 12, 15 or 18 months. For a patient who needs a cataract procedure, that has an impact because it affects their sight and their quality of life. One gentleman I was dealing with needed two cataracts done. Thankfully, after a lot of lobbying of hospital management, we eventually got him seen through the NTPF and he will be seen that bit quicker. If he was left on the waiting list, we were told he would wait at least 15 months for that to be done. That is the reality people are dealing with.",
                "I make that point to reinforce what I am talking about here. There was a lot of excitement when Sláintecare was agreed. Deputy O'Reilly was the representative of my party on the committee at the time. A huge amount of work by many people went into ensuring we set out a roadmap that could transform our health service and deliver the type of health service people want. That is one where people do not have to wait years for basic procedures, or for serious operations, which is also the case, or for speech and language therapy, occupational therapy or access to a dietitian. All those community waiting lists have also got very long in recent years. We currently have 250,000 people on community waiting lists. It is staggering. The vast majority of them have been waiting over 12 months and, in some cases, over two years. We have to juxtapose that with the Sláintecare targets, according to which people should be seen within a matter of weeks. Instead, they are waiting years in some cases.",
                "What does our Bill seek to do? It requires the Minister to set priorities for the HSE with regard to maximum wait times and to set specific targets. We want those targets to be the Sláintecare targets we agreed to. The Bill specifies 12 types of service for which there should be maximum wait times and allows the Minister to specify any other service. The Minister must have regard to the Sláintecare report, best practice, outcomes and the effect on services of specifying maximum wait times. The maximum wait time targets are not specified in the Bill because we deliberately gave the Minister flexibility and allowed her to set what she might see as more realistic initial targets as we move incrementally towards implementing the Sláintecare targets.",
                "Why that is being opposed I have no idea. The Minister and Government will have to explain why they are so far behind their Sláintecare targets and why people are waiting so long. When we in opposition come forward with solutions, which we have done in this area, they get knocked back time and again. It does not make sense to me in relation to some of the proposals we have been calling for for years. They include an integrated waiting list management system to better utilise all resources across all hospitals so a person is not referred to a single doctor and waiting on that doctor's list unable to be seen by a different hospital or even a different doctor within the same hospital. Having that integrated system would mean patients could be offered procedures much quicker, yet that does not happen.",
                "We saw recently with the scandal of insourcing the concerns, challenges and difficulties posed by single consultants managing waiting lists rather than their being managed by a hospital or hospital group or being centralised in some way. Having a local list but also a centralised list makes sense. We have been calling for that for so long, yet it has not been implemented.",
                "I also seek in this Bill to bring a greater degree of transparency to waiting lists. At the end of every month, the NTPF publishes some waiting lists. It publishes the acute hospital waiting list, which is very welcome, but it does not publish diagnostic waiting lists or community waiting lists. It does not cover mental health waiting lists, CAMHS or any of the other areas of social care and healthcare where people are waiting. We have to put in parliamentary questions to get that response. It is the same with dental treatment.",
                "I got a reply to a parliamentary question recently. I had to ask the question three or four times to get the information I was looking for. I eventually got it but that information should be transparent and clear and on the NTPF website with the other waiting lists for acute hospitals. It beggars belief that with all the new technologies in the healthcare system, we still do not publish all the waiting lists with wait times. They should be broken down by region, county and area. That would give all of us a chance to see which areas are performing and which are not, where pressures exist and where pressures do not exist. We can then praise those efforts which are achieving better results.",
                "An example is in my constituency of Waterford, where the hospital is one of the better performing hospitals. Wait times are down. People are not waiting on trolleys in emergency departments in the same way they are in other hospitals. It is good for all of us to see what is and is not good practice. Transparency around waiting lists shows up that there are sometimes regional differences, not because management or staff in those areas are not doing their best but because we do not have the staff. We might not have the equipment, resources, capacity or whatever it might be. That is mostly the reason we have those types of regional disparities. If we do not have the waiting lists and cannot measure or compare, obviously that is not good. I have always said data is really important in the healthcare system. If we have very good data, we can do so much more.",
                "I was at a meeting of the Oireachtas health committee a number of weeks ago. I am not sure if the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, was at that session on digital transformation and the roll-out of the unique health identifiers and electronic health records, EHRs, all of which we are told will happen over the coming years. It will take six or seven years for the full bells and whistles of the EHRs to be in place and for this State to have digital hospitals. While that is being done, it is the perfect time for the State to get its act together on waiting lists. I have seen so many waiting list initiatives from Governments. We could paper the walls of this place with all the winter plans and waiting list initiatives - money thrown at the system, money for insourcing, money for outsourcing. Yet when we look at the waiting list, we see people are still waiting far too long and we are nowhere near the Sláintecare targets.",
                "We have to start looking at outputs and asking why, with record investment in healthcare, we are still not getting the results we need or seeing waiting lists come down to the extent required. It is partly resources and capacity. If we do not have the staff, beds, physical space or equipment, we cannot provide the surgeries or procedures or make appointments as quickly as they need to be made. Equally, if the processes are not working or are cumbersome or protective and create little fiefdoms where people control waiting lists and there is not freedom to move from one waiting list to another, that does not make sense. It does not make sense to me or to a patient waiting for a hip procedure in Waterford when there may well be an opportunity to be seen in Kilkenny, Wexford or somewhere else quicker. Why are those opportunities not being made available? Why are we not harnessing that potential and using the full resources of the health service we have?",
                "Again, there is evidence of good practice in this area. I go back to my constituency. I was part of a group of Oireachtas Members who met monthly with hospital management and the regional hospital group. We forced them to have better engagement with the local private hospital, UPMC Whitfield, doing a lot of elective procedures and diagnostic work. They bought up beds in private nursing homes and contracted beds to ensure speedier discharges. They also put better systems in place to manage waiting lists and for better collaboration between consultants and staff for discharges and so on.",
                "Processes do work. Flow in a hospital is important. Flow in the healthcare system is important if you get it right. What is frustrating is we see evidence in other countries of the solutions we are proposing to fix the problem and to integrate and manage waiting lists in a much more productive way, yet we have a Government that simply will not accept them. It says all the right things and offers nice words when we raise this but then it does not happen. I will be interested to hear the Minister of State's speech and to hear exactly why the Bill is being opposed. There may be some good reason for it.",
                "This is a Bill we got a lot of help with putting together to ensure it was as fit for purpose as it possibly could be. I am sure the Minister of State may have been in opposition himself at some point. We do not have the resources a Department has or an army of civil servants to do a Bill, so we do our best, as the Opposition, to craft Bills that are as fit for purpose as possible. Even if they were not ideal or perfect, the reason we have Committee Stage in Bills is so that, if there are any issues, they can be discussed, amended and got to a point where we have more fit-for-purpose Bills.",
                "I will finish on this. I have not spoken to the Minister of State and I do not know why the Bill is being amended but for whatever reason it is being amended, I hope he is coming with an alternative and not just coming again to say \"No\" to the solutions we are putting forward. I do not want to be here in five years' time again still talking about problems with managing waiting lists or about people waiting too long; still waiting for the elective hospitals to be built or the 3,000 beds that Stephen Donnelly promised, which we will not see delivered over the next five years; and still looking for transparency around mental health waiting lists, community waiting lists and so on, where I have to put in parliamentary questions again and again and ask them in a dozen different ways to try to get the information I want. Surely the Minister of State is going to respond by setting out a plan in relation to greater transparency with waiting lists, and a better way to manage them as well."

                "I thank Deputies Cullinane and Ward for raising this important issue. I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Health (Waiting Lists) Bill 2024, which the Deputies have put forward. I recognise the worthwhile intentions and aims of the Deputies in tabling this Bill. I am taking this matter on behalf of Minister for Health, Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill.",
                "Specifically, the Bill seeks to introduce requirements for setting priorities and maximum waiting time performance targets for services across hospital and community sectors, to extend the waiting list reporting role of the National Treatment Purchase Fund and to place additional statutory accountability measures on the National Treatment Purchase Fund in relation to Oireachtas Committees. In principle, the proposals put forward are in line with measures already in place in relation to priority and target setting; with the continual development and improvement of waiting list reporting; and with our shared recognition of the need to ensure the accountability of aegis bodies under Departments. However, notwithstanding the merits of what the Bill aims to achieve, the Government is opposing it on the basis that the specific proposals are not necessary, given the measures already in place or being developed, and in some cases are not possible to implement. Furthermore, the proposals will not address the key issue, which is the length of time people are waiting for treatment. To reiterate, the Government will be opposing the Bill for reasons I will outline in greater detail.",
                "On priority and target setting, throughout their proposals, the Deputies acknowledge the importance of having clearly defined priority and target setting in the delivery of health services. This is already in place, with an existing rigorous process underpinned by strong governance arrangements across the Department, the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund.",
                "In regard to letters of determination and the national service plan, on foot of the budget announcement, the Minister for Health’s letters of determination to the HSE include the requirements that the HSE’s national service plan for the following year must set out the type and volume of services to be delivered and appropriately reflect the priorities set out by the Minister in the Department. That is set out under the Health Act 2004.",
                "On maximum wait times, the targets in the national service plan are set having regard, as the Deputy has already referenced, to the 2017 Sláintecare report, which specifies maximum waiting time targets for scheduled care in our hospitals of ten weeks for a first outpatient appointment and 12 weeks for an inpatient or day case procedure. The range of waiting time targets for scheduled care set out in each year’s national service plan represents progressive steps towards the ultimate goal of the Sláintecare targets.",
                "In regard to the performance engagement model, it provides a framework for oversight and engagement on performance issues between the Department and the HSE, and ensures that HSE performance can be measured against the objectives and targets set out in the national service plan. Internally, the HSE implements the performance and accountability framework, which sets out how the HSE’s regions and national services are held to account for their performance.",
                "In line with the programme for Government, the Government’s priority for 2026 is to improve healthcare access and quality across all health regions. This requires greater regional and national accountability for performance against national service plan targets. As such, the performance and accountability framework will further strengthen transparency across every level of the health service, with clear lines of authority, responsibility and accountability to ensure delivery on commitments.",
                "The multiannual waiting list action plan approach, which commenced in September 2021, facilitates target setting and monitoring for acute hospital waiting list performance and has been highly effective in improving waiting times for our hospital services. While it is acknowledged that further improvements are needed, the effectiveness of the structures in place is evident in the improvements to waiting list performance since the action plan approach was implemented. As of the end of October 2025, these include a 55% reduction, or 155,000 fewer patients, waiting over 12 months, an improvement of 44% in the average waiting time for patients on lists from 12.2 to 6.8 months, and an 11% reduction in the number of patients waiting longer than the ten- and 12-week Sláintecare targets, which equates to 66,000 patients. The Department of Health is currently engaging with the HSE and National Treatment Purchase Fund to develop the plans for 2026, which will build on the progress delivered to date, renewing the focus on further improving waiting times for patients and considering the learnings from the challenges that arose in 2025.",
                "On the matter of waiting list reporting, the Bill also seeks to extend the role of the National Treatment Purchase Fund by expanding its reporting function to include non-hospital services such as primary care, disability and mental health, and to provide a greater level of detail about those services than is currently available. In regard to the development of waiting list reporting, there is currently a robust structure in place between the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund for the collection, collation and validation of acute hospital outpatient, inpatient and day case waiting list information. However, it is important to note that this is being continually developed and improved upon to provide access to greater levels of waiting list information. This is evidenced in the significant work currently under way on a best practice reporting project led by the National Treatment Purchase Fund. The scope of the best practice reporting programme is to implement waiting time and waiting list reporting for patients on acute hospital waiting lists.",
                "The greater access to meaningful wait time information for patients and practitioners that will be provided through best practice reporting will assist in maximising resources in the effective management of waiting time and waiting list information. Significantly for patients, best practice reporting will provide them with reliable information on how long they can expect to be waiting for their treatment. Over time, the significant programme of work that has been undertaken and data infrastructure that has been developed across acute hospital services have provided greater visibility of these services from several perspectives. It also provides a platform for reform and the development of data-driven interventions to improve productivity and benchmark performance.",
                "Looking at primary care waiting lists, to address the long waiting times for primary care, the Department of Health is currently working with the HSE on a focused, programmatic approach to primary care waiting list management, aiming to put in place considerable standardised infrastructure to support systematic responses to primary care waiting lists. Data are a key aspect of the standardised infrastructure that is needed to bring about long-term improvements to how we plan for faster access to those services. However, currently, there are widely acknowledged limitations in the level of data available at a granular level in terms of the primary care therapies and related activity and waiting lists.",
                "One of the aims of the programmatic approach is to address these data limitations. While work in this regard has commenced, it would not be possible at this juncture, as proposed in the Bill by the Deputies, for the National Treatment Purchase Fund to support or deliver waiting list reporting for primary care to the standard currently achieved for acute hospital waiting lists.",
                "In regard to community and child and adult mental health services, CAMHS, waiting lists, there is a long-standing and well-established reporting and monitoring system between the Department of Health and the HSE in relation to improving access to CAMHS and reducing waiting lists for those services.",
                "This process involves regular engagement and detailed data returns, which will continue to be enhanced. It is worth noting that reductions in the waiting list for CAMHS have been achieved despite the continued increasing demand for those services.",
                "The Bill also aims to ensure the accountability of the NTPF by placing a requirement on the CEO of the NTPF to appear before Oireachtas committees upon request. The NTPF board is accountable to the Minister for Health and comprehensive governance arrangements are in place to ensure the NTPF meets its requirements under the code of practice for the governance of State bodies. Under its establishment order, the CEO is required to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts. It has also demonstrated its willingness to engage with other Oireachtas committees having appeared before the Joint Committee on Health this year.",
                "As I have set out, while the merits of the Bill are acknowledged, the existing processes and governance structures in place are fully adequate to support improved waiting list performance. This is evident in the progress that has been achieved to date. It is also important to recognise that the appropriateness of the structures in place is only one aspect of what is needed to ensure improved waiting list performance. Notwithstanding the progress that has been achieved to date, it is acknowledged that many patients are waiting too long for care and much further work is needed. I again thank the Deputies, particularly Deputies Cullinane and Mark Ward, for raising these important issues. While our methodology and approach may differ, the Government welcomes that there is a shared recognition of what needs to be in place in principle to address the challenge of reducing waiting times. For the reasons I have put forward, the Government and Minister will be opposing this Bill."

                "Having listened to what the Minister of State said here today, it seems quite clear to me that there is no will from Government to change this. The reality is that this is affecting real people's lives as it does day and day out and as it does today while people are waiting to have procedures and consultations. We are talking about people waiting in the emergency department in Galway University Hospital for the care they so desperately need. It also affects those people who want to provide that care. If we take Galway as an example, we can see that 6,000 people are waiting over six months for procedures. There are 20,000 people waiting over six months for a consultation. This is a huge number of people in Galway who are waiting to get the basic healthcare they need.",
                "A key issue coming into my office involves people coming in who have been waiting for the pain clinic. Imagine having to wait to get this help for pain. You are getting older, you are in massive pain and you have to come into an office to speak to someone like me because you are trying to get help for that pain. That is wrong. It should not be like that. It should be that if you need healthcare, you get that healthcare but instead so many people are coming into our offices who are not getting this care.",
                "Then there is the issue of people waiting for dental care. We always get a mother ringing us desperately saying her child needs some type of dental care, it is urgent and it is affecting the child going to school or being able to eat but she is being told that her child cannot get the dental care they need.",
                "One of the things I really wanted to raise involves emergency departments. As somebody who has visited people in the emergency department of late, I know that the overcrowding is unbelievable and outrageous. We have had many campaigns, including a strong campaign relating to people presenting with mental health issues going to accident and emergency and not being in an appropriate setting. I do not think it is an appropriate setting either for people receiving chemotherapy who are advised that if they go into their local shop, they need to wear a face mask, yet they are spending hours overnight on a trolley in accident and emergency. That does not make sense. I do not know if anybody can make that make sense but that is wrong. I have contacted Galway University Hospital about this. It told me that it is under huge pressure and its staff are under huge pressure. If it does not seem to be able to come to me with a satisfactory answer, I will bring it to the Minister of State. I would like him to raise that issue with the HSE because that is wrong. I will contact the Minister of State directly.",
                "Given the impact of overcrowding, we need to look at rural areas and how they can assist. I raised the nine beds in Áras Mhic Dara with the Minister of State and I know he hoped to meet with the HSE about that. Perhaps he has an update.",
                "I thank Deputy Cullinane for bringing forward this Bill, particularly during the winter and at Christmas time when so many people have the flu and other bugs and end up in our hospitals, are in hospital over Christmas or are waiting for a pain clinic. Christmas is always a time when there is a focus. It is deeply unfortunate that the Minister of State is not supporting this Bill. I hope he reconsiders that but I hope he can follow up on those key issues I mentioned."

                "I also welcome the Bill and commend Deputies Cullinane and Mark Ward and Sinn Féin on bringing it forward. I have to say that it is disappointing that the Government is once again opposing a Bill from the Opposition. This morning, I attended the working group of committee Chairs with the Taoiseach, who spoke very openly about how he is open to taking amendments from the Opposition, listening to different groups and engaging with people in a productive way to have a productive Parliament. I was surprised because it is not my experience. I have been here a year and not a single amendment put forward from the Opposition benches has been accepted by the Minister for Health - not one. Not a single Bill we have put forward has been accepted in a year. At the same time, Ministers and the Taoiseach in particular, especially at Leaders' Questions, come in and say the Opposition has no ideas, solutions or proposals. When serious proposals are put forward, they are just dismissed out of hand and given no serious consideration. It is deeply frustrating.",
                "We saw it yesterday when my party put forward a Bill on animal welfare. It was similar with our votes at 16 Bill and our Bill in the Seanad on domestic violence. Time and time again, there is a timed amendment, our legislation is dismissed and we are told we have no ideas. When a very well-constructed and serious Bill like the one put forward by Deputy Cullinane is put forward, again it is opposed. I am only here a year and I find it deeply frustrating. I am sure others who are here longer find it even worse.",
                "People outside the Houses, including the citizens watching this debate, do not have trust in our democratic system and process because we have a system that is two-faced in many regards. On the one hand, the Taoiseach says he is very open to accepting amendments, listening to the Opposition and engaging. On the other hand, the Government just dismisses proposals and suggestions out of hand. I ask the Government and the Department of Health, which has not accepted a single amendment to any legislation in a year, to think again about the strategy and approach, to engage meaningfully with the constructive proposals put before them and to stop dismissing things out of hand because it is bad for our democracy, our Republic and our governance and we can do better.",
                "I welcome the Bill. The main provisions about putting waiting list targets on a statutory footing, publishing all waiting lists across the health service and making the NTPF more accountable to the Dáil are things all parties here should accept and progress. Sláintecare set out the core wait times of ten weeks for outpatients and 12 weeks for inpatient day cases. These wait times were to be underpinned by legislation and implemented on a phased basis by 2023, but that did not happen. Is the Government now opposed to the idea of legislating for wait times because that is what I heard from the Minister of State's speech? Is he now against that and going against the recommendation from Sláintecare? If so, I would like him to tell us more about that.",
                "In February, the Minister published the waiting list action plan for 2025 with the aim that 50% of patients would wait less than the Sláintecare target of ten weeks for their first outpatient appointment and 12 weeks for their day appointment by the end of 2025.",
                "In October, which is the last published month, outpatient appointments were 69.4% over the target, while active inpatient and day cases were 62% over the target. Time and again, we are missing those targets and people are waiting far too long to get access to the health services. Supply-side interventions are needed for investment in primary and community care so that our hospitals are not the default but supply-side policies alone will not address the waiting list problems. Sláintecare is clear on the requirement for maximum wait-time guarantees and the need to ensure that people responsible for holding those guarantees are held to account. This is why we need legislation like this.",
                "Currently, the NTPF publishes monthly acute hospital waiting lists and some diagnostic waiting lists. However, those for other areas, such as primary care, are not routinely published. Instead, these must be sought via parliamentary questions, as they are not routinely compiled. This makes it very difficult to get a true picture of the total number of people on health and social care waiting lists in the State and, most importantly, to provide a true picture of the wait times across services. Waiting times in primary and community care are the hidden crisis in our health services. In September, figures I compiled showed there are over 300,000 people on some of our primary and community health and social care waiting lists. Over 240 have been waiting for more than three months, while more than 100,000 people have been waiting for over a year. An extraordinary number of people are waiting an extraordinary length of time to get access to health services in this State. Quite shockingly, 42,000 children were found to be waiting for more than a year across eight core primary care services, including occupational therapy, physiotherapy and speech and language therapy. A massive number of children are waiting far too long to get access to these core primary care services.",
                "On NTPF accountability, while the NTPF is required to appear before the public accounts committee, as specified under legislation, and potentially other committees, such as the health committee, there is undoubtedly an arm's-length level of accountability, which needs to be rectified. Instead of being a response of last resort, the NTPF has regrettably become an integrated part of the State's healthcare landscape. The health service has become increasingly reliant on the NTPF, which has a €230 million budget this year compared with €55 million in 2018. We have seen this balloon and balloon, with massive expenditure.",
                "A HSE examination over a 27-month period revealed the scale of the HSE's dependency on insourcing and outsourcing. A total of €830 million was spent on outsourcing and around €100 million was spent on insourcing. Huge sums of public money are being spent. While greater controls have been put in place until insourcing is phased out in June 2026, little is being done to address the dependency on outsourcing. This is something that needs to be addressed. The reliance comes at a major cost that is not just financial. It is hollowing out public capacity and creating a perverse incentive for staff to move from the public to private sector. It is a vicious cycle.",
                "I would like to hear about the Sláintecare commitment around the legislation and what the Government's current position is on that, and what else will be done to reduce waiting lists. Too many people in our State are waiting far too long to get access to core health services they desperately need. People are waiting in pain and anguish. They are getting sicker and, ultimately, dying sooner because they are not getting access to health services. This Government and this State are failing too many people. It needs to change."

We have to be honest here. As recently as September, the Secretary General of the Department of Health talked about the Department remaining committed to achieving the Sláintecare targets of ten weeks for outpatient appointments and 12 weeks for inpatient and day-case procedures. We all know, however, that unless someone's feet are held to the fire, it is hardwired into legislation and we have clear legislative targets, this will be a pipe dream within the health service. As was referenced, Sláintecare very clearly set out that there should be legislation, and that there needs to be maximum wait times for both performance targets and accountability with regard to these wait times.",
                "The experience of so many across our public healthcare system at the moment is of unacceptably long wait lists. Currently, 625,000 people are on acute hospital outpatient waiting lists and 110,000 are waiting a year or more. While the targets are there, only 30.5% of people are being seen within that ten-week target, which is a deterioration on where things were at last year. Things are actually getting worse rather than better. We then see the Government opposing legislation such as this, which is obviously brought in good faith to try to ensure there is real accountability within the system.",
                "I got a letter some days ago from a consultant ophthalmologist in Cork, who talked about a particular patient who will have to wait until 2028 to get her cataract surgery done. This patient is deemed to be semi-urgent, yet she will have to wait well over three and a half years from when she was referred. This ophthalmologist talked about having made protected disclosures and raising concerns to the highest level about the lack of resources, yet little is being done. There is a huge amount of frustration, upset and lack of trust in the public system, which is pushing people into the hands of private health insurance. Nobody should feel they have to have private health insurance in this country. It should be just to get the private room, but instead people feel they have to take it out in order to jump the queue and get faster access because there is that lack of confidence and trust in so many parts of the public system.",
                "An important part of the Bill that was referred to in the reporting on the waiting lists is the glaring absence of the NTPF figures because they just relate to acute hospital care. We do not have comprehensive waiting list data with regard to primary care and diagnostics. We all know that in primary care, and we have all asked the parliamentary questions, which we have to ask because it is the only course of action to try to find out the information, just how bad the waiting times are. In recent weeks, we saw that 28,000 children are now on a psychology waiting list. When we asked the question earlier this year, we saw there was a 170% increase in the wait list in three short years. A fundamental problem ultimately is the lack of a periodic publication of the waiting lists in that sector to see whether we are seeing an improvement or, which is of course what is happening, a disimprovement in the children's disability waiting list figures. We have heard from Bernard Gloster that there is now an action plan for physiotherapy, speech and language therapy, SLT, and OT. We very much welcome that. I welcomed it at the committee a few weeks ago but there is a glaring absence with regard to psychology waiting lists. The critical thing here is we do not have systematic data collection on diagnostics in primary care.",
                "There is a cost, human and financial, for the failure to have joined-up thinking on the lack of resources in our health system at this point in time. A patient came to me in my constituency in recent weeks. He is a patient at Beaumont who needs to be tested via a Holter device. It is a monitor that effectively detects arrhythmias or heart palpitations. His consultant cannot see him until he has worn that small device to monitor his heart rhythm during the daytime. When we started asking the questions across the various hospitals, we saw that the next available appointment in Beaumont for a Holter monitor is June 2026. In St. James's, the average waiting time is 22 months. It has only ten monitors and 733 patients on the waiting list. In Galway, 600 people are on the waiting list who have been waiting 12 months; some have been waiting four years. Patients have to wear this device before they can see the cardiologist. For urgent patients needing a monitor in CUH, the wait is up to four months. These are patients who are deemed to be urgent. The cost of this monitor is just €2,500. There is much technology, devices and equipment in the health sector that costs hundreds of thousands of euro. This is a very simple, relatively cheap device in the general scheme of things within the health sector.",
                "Yet, we are not seeing the investment needed to ensure that the people involved can be properly monitored, get to see their cardiologists and move through the system.",
                "There are so many blockages in the system. It is not just about staffing. So much of the conversation in this regard revolves around staffing, and rightly so, and beds. The conversation also needs to be about equipment and devices. We are not talking about CT scanners, MRIs or PET scanners in this instance; we are talking about a device that costs €2,500. In the context of a consultant seeing a patient, however, the latter could be waiting four years before they are monitored. It is a reflection of how broken parts of our health system are that we are not even getting the basics right. Ultimately, we need to make sure that we have a much more comprehensive and systematic attitude towards the collection of data in the health service. That is why the Labour Party is happy to support the Bill.",
                "The NTPF is charged with a number of responsibilities, one of which is oversight of waiting lists in hospitals. There is a real issue now about where responsibility lies in terms of monitoring how people are allocated onto the in-service or outsourced service provision. Like Deputy Rice, I am less than 12 months in this brief as my party's spokesperson on health. In the context of all the revelations we have seen this year, one of the things which strikes me is that there is not a clear sense of responsibility as to who takes ownership of the transfer of people from waiting lists to the NTPF. The latter makes certain claims. Hospitals in certain areas have taken responsibility themselves, with varying degrees of consistency. We need to get the right level of transparency when it comes to the NTPF. So much money has been put into the fund. We do not want such reliance on the NTPF, but it has become a necessary evil that we have to outsource because there is no other option following a decade of underinvestment in the health service. A key part of the legislation before us relates to ensuring that there is greater transparency in the context of the NTPF. My party very much supports the Bill."

                "As already stated, while recognising the worthwhile intentions and aims of the Deputies in tabling this Bill, the Government is opposing it on the basis that the proposed measures are not necessary in light of the effectiveness of the current arrangements and structures that are already in place. There are rigorous and effective structures and processes in place for setting priorities and targets for delivery of health and social care services. These include the letter of determination, the national service plan and performance oversight within the HSE and between the HSE and the Department, including the waiting list action plan. In terms of the proposed measures to expand upon waiting list reporting set out in the Bill, significant work is already under way to improve and build upon the information available at present. However, the current limitations in relation to the availability of waiting lists to deliver the specific enhancements set out in the Bill would prevent the proposal from being implemented and would thereby undermine the intentional impact of the legislative change being proposed.",
                "With regard to the proposal that the NTPF be made accountable to a committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas, I set out the thorough and extensive measures for oversight and governance of the fund that are in place between the Department and that organisation. In addition, the NTPF is required to appear before the public accounts committee, as specified in the legislation under which it was established. The NTPF has demonstrated willingness to engage with the Oireachtas upon request, including on a number of occasions this year. Obviously, at meetings of the public accounts committee, its representatives are questioned by Deputies on the basis of work done by the Comptroller and Auditor General.",
                "As already outlined, the Government is satisfied the structures already in place are appropriate to ensure effective priorities and target setting as well as the live and extensive reporting of waiting list information. In addition, access to accurate data about patients waiting for service across the system is recognised as being crucial to how we can facilitate access to those services. However, it is important to remember that these are only aspects of the solution to address the key issue of the length of time people are waiting for treatment. The improvements achieved in terms of acute hospital waiting lists and waiting times are being driven by specific actions aimed at increasing capacity and embedding reform by means of the waiting list action plan approach. Examples of this include the ongoing establishment of the surgical hubs around the country and the further roll-out of modernised care pathways.",
                "Embedding reform actions in our system will ensure the most efficient use of available resources in a patient-centred way, including initiative seeking to optimise the patient pathway from referral to discharge. The implementation and progression of the multi-annual action plan approach is not happening in isolation. The longer term reform of scheduled care and reduction in waiting times is interconnected with and influenced by a number of developments across the health service. This includes the continued focus on productivity and efficiency improvements and the shift of more care into community settings and alternative care pathways. These interdependencies underline the complexity of the system of the system and how an integrated and holistic approach is needed to ensure waiting times are improved across the health service to ensure people have access to the care they need when they need it."

It is embarrassing for one simple reason, namely it is what the Minister of State and the Government signed up to. It is what we all signed up to when we agreed Sláintecare. An Teachta Rice is right. It is alarming that the Government is clearly stating that it is walking away from a commitment given to put in place statutory waiting list targets and maximum waiting list times.",
                "The Minister of State is mixing up policy and policy targets, on the one hand, and statutory targets, on the other. That is the difference between what this Bill seeks to do and what he outlined. What we see routinely from this Government are HSE service plans. These are produced every year but are not worth the paper they are written on because the HSE does not have the capacity to meet any of the targets. Almost every target that is set is broken. The Minister of State cited all of the targets set out even in the most recent waiting list plan to reduce wait times in some areas by 50%. Nobody out there, not even the people who wrote the script for him, believe that is going to happen. All we have are these published fantasy targets. It is a case of \"We will see what is going to happen, but we are not going to do anything and do not really care.\" That is what I hear from Government.",
                "Before I get into some of the process issues behind the Bill and the reasons I think the explanations the Minister of State gave are utter nonsense, I highlight the fact that I am also of the view that we will not reduce waiting lists until we put capacity into the system. We have to build the four elective hospitals. We have to deliver on the hospital beds. We have to deliver on the diagnostic capacity. We have to upgrade equipment. We need new equipment in some hospitals, and we need staff. We need to train more healthcare professionals to fill the gaps where there are staff shortages. All of those are obvious ingredients when it comes to reducing waiting lists and providing faster care.",
                "In the context of Sláintecare, it is understood that process is important. Setting targets is also important, however. I do not believe we will ever solve the problem in emergency departments and have a situation where people will not be left on trolleys if we do not adopt a zero-tolerance approach. That is precisely what happened in Waterford, where the hospital manager at the time said that one person on a hospital trolley was one too many and adopted a zero-tolerance approach as a result. He did not believe change would happen overnight, or in a week or a month.",
                "However, if we set it as a target, the entire system - the staff, consultants, nurses, healthcare assistants, radiographers and everybody working in hospitals and in other parts of the healthcare system which are crucial in the context of reducing crises in emergency departments and identifying what the capacity needs are - will be forced to get us to a point where we do not have patients on trolleys. That is precisely what happened and it would not have happened if a zero-tolerance approach had not been taken.",
                "It is the same with the maximum wait time targets. The reason Sláintecare set those targets was that it was believed, on the advice of the Department, the HSE and all the experts who came before the special Oireachtas committee that looked at Sláintecare, it was possible to do it. The purpose of setting a maximum wait time was to force the system to put the capacity in to meeting that objective. The Government is now walking away from that. The Minister of State shook his head earlier when he indicated it was not but clearly it is. The reason he gave for opposing this Bill was that the Government did not have to accept this because it was doing it anyway. It is not doing it. It does not have statutory targets. I do not know if the Minister of State could point to me where on the Statute Book the Government has ever legislated for the Sláintecare targets. I know it has not done so.",
                "Coming then to the community waiting lists, I find the Government's response on those even worse, and breathtaking in many ways. It is an acceptance of utter failure by the Government. It is really saying it cannot publish the community waiting list times through the NTPF, in the same way as the acute hospitals, because we are not up to that standard yet. What an appalling response and appalling situation for us to find ourselves in. We have children and adults on those waiting lists waiting for access to dentists, dietitians, speech and language therapists and all the other community waiting lists. We get those responses back through parliamentary questions. They may not be perfect, and I made that point earlier, but at least we get numbers. It is possible for Government to publish those waiting list times. If they are imperfect and need to be improved or brought up to a standard similar to those for the acute hospitals, that can happen over time and evolve. However, simply to say we are not doing it because we do not believe we can do it to the same standard as acute hospital waiting lists is not a satisfactory response. We have an entitlement to the highest levels of transparency. I imagine it frustrates patients that we spend tens of billions every year on health and yet there is basic information we cannot collate or publish.",
                "I will finish how I started. If I was in the Minister of State's shoes, I would have handed the speech back and said, \"No thanks, I am not going to read that out\" because it essentially tells the public the Government is again walking away from one of the key proposals and action points it had in accepting Sláintecare. That is regrettable. My party remains committed to Sláintecare and to the highest levels of transparency in the health service for waiting lists. We also remain committed to people getting timely, fast and rapid access to care, as best we can. This will not happen overnight and there is a lot to be done to get to a point where we can reach those targets. Unless we take targets seriously, however, which the Government is not doing based on the Minister of State's speech, and use those targets to mobilise and marshal the resources of the health service to meet them, patients will continue to wait. I gave the examples of patients waiting for cataract, hip and hernia operations, which are standard day-case procedures in most cases, but there are others, including cancer care, cardiac care and so on.",

Deis atá ann dom freisin ball an choiste a chur ar an eolas faoi cad atá ar siúl ag an Rialtas agus faoi roinnt de na polasaithe atá faoi chaibidil againn. I thank the Cathaoirleach for the invitation to be here today. At the outset, I acknowledge the importance of our committee system. Committees play a valuable role in the parliamentary process, involving detailed scrutiny of legislation, spending and policies, and engaging with members of the public, stakeholders and officials. I thank the Cathaoirligh and Leas-Chathaoirligh for their contribution to this collective effort. I am keen to hear how their work is progressing and to discuss issues of common interest.",
                "I have a few brief introductory remarks to update members on the work of the Government. It does not cover all of the issues but it gives a snapshot of some of the issues we have been dealing with.",
                "I was very glad to welcome President Zelenskyy and the First Lady of Ukraine last week. We all had the honour of hearing his words in person at the joint sitting. Ireland's solidarity with Ukraine is unchanged. I assured the President of Ireland's continuing support. The Government announced an additional €100 million in non-lethal military support, as well as €25 million for Ukraine's energy supplies to help to counter Russia's ongoing attacks on their vital infrastructure.",
                "In the changed European security environment, Ireland clearly needs to invest more in our security and defence capabilities, including against the growing cyber and hybrid threats. Indeed, there is a shared assessment that Europe needs to do more. It is important that Ireland is an active participant in the process while respecting our traditional policy of military neutrality. In the 2026 budget, the Government provided a record €1.5 billion allocation in defence funding and a record €1.7 billion in defence capital investment as part of our revised national development plan. Very significant work has been and is taking place under the Commission on the Defence Forces to improve our military capability: the acquisition of primary radar and subsea sonar capability; additional air assets; counter drone capabilities; and continued work to tackle recruitment and retention issues. In the modern security environment, no state can counter shared challenges alone. We must and will continue to work with partners in protecting our national interests and our shared European interests. That is absolutely key.",
                "President Zelenskyy thanked Ireland for providing homes and protection to Ukrainians when they needed it most and looked forward to the day when Ukrainians can welcome all their friends to their own country in peace. Ireland will always be a place to offer protection to those fleeing war and persecution and will always adopt a firm but fair approach to migration, which is an essential part of maintaining our successful economy. Ireland fully supports the priority afforded to the EU migration agenda. Europe must collectively address the shared challenges of unplanned migration and operate a predictable and flexible system, characterised by responsibility and solidarity, for the reception and management of protection applications. The EU migration and asylum pact represents a necessary improvement on the current protection system and we propose to modernise and strengthen our legislative and policy framework for both international protection and naturalisation. These changes will ensure closer alignment with established practice in other EU member states and also take account of developments in the United Kingdom.",
                "I met with Prime Minister Starmer last week at the British-Irish Council summit in Wales and we noted the progress made on implementing the commitments in the UK-Ireland 2030 programme of strategic co-operation. We look forward to the second UK-Ireland summit, which Ireland will host in spring next year. The publication on 19 September of a joint framework addressing the legacy of the Troubles represents a clear break with the 2023 UK legacy Act and shows a return to partnership by the two Governments on Northern Ireland, working together as co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement. We also referenced the publication this week of the entire Kenova report. I commend the authors of that report, which reveals a very sordid situation in Northern Ireland for over 25 years in terms of the use of agents in collusion but also in terms of appalling campaigns of terror against communities in Northern Ireland by paramilitaries. We also got a summary of the Denton report. I regret that the full report is not available. I look forward to the Dáil debating both reports in the new year.",
                "Through the expanded and strengthened shared island initiative, backed by our commitment of €2 billion to the shared island fund out to 2035, the Government is continuing to work to foster reconciliation, mutual respect and growth. About €500 million of that has now been allocated to a range of projects and programmes. There is the dialogue strand and the research strand. The objective is to bring co-operation and relationships across the island of Ireland to a new level. Last month, the Government announced allocations of over €50 million from the shared island fund for ten new projects that are now being taken forward by Ministers.",
                "The delivery of essential infrastructure is a key driver in ensuring our economy's competitiveness and resilience. In the past five years, more than €65 billion has been invested in capital infrastructure projects. Persistent and accelerated progress in delivery across areas such as housing, healthcare, energy, water and wastewater, innovation, and addressing climate change are crucial in maintaining and strengthening our prosperity.",
                "The Government's new accelerating infrastructure action plan will help drive the efficient delivery of infrastructure across Ireland by addressing critical barriers to infrastructure development. We are moving at pace to reform our planning system.",
                "This includes enabling local authorities to zone sufficient land for residential development to support the step-up required in delivery. Last month, the Government published a new housing plan, which aims to deliver 300,000 new homes by the end of 2030. The new plan, informed by the work of the Housing Commission, will empower the State, partners and the private sector to play a critical part in delivery. It is underpinned by the largest ever capital investment in the history of the State, with €275 billion in infrastructure over ten years through the revised national development plan.",
                "We will continue to invest in our economy and our people and the services they need. Budget 2026 demonstrates our strong commitment to plan for and secure Ireland's future, while preserving the jobs, stability and prosperity of today. We are fully aware of the competitiveness challenges we face. We are working hard to ensure Ireland remains a trusted, stable and attractive location for businesses in a rapidly changing world. The recent Government action plan on competitiveness and productivity provides a concrete policy to our economic vision, focusing on elements within our domestic sphere of influence.",
                "As a small global economy, Ireland has greatly benefited from international trade and the European Union Single Market as well as cultivating and nurturing strong international relationships. With our market diversification action plan, published in August, we aim to expand these relationships and identify new market opportunities by utilising our membership of the Single Market, eliminating trade barriers and addressing sector-specific needs.",
                "At the recent meeting of COP30, Ireland stood firmly with the European Union in pursuing ambitious new national contributions aligned with keeping global warming below 1.5°C, while championing adaptation and supporting the world's most vulnerable nations. As a country and as a Government, we are serious about meeting our responsibilities in the fight against climate change. The latest Environmental Protection Agency figures show three consecutive years of emissions reductions. Our emissions are now at their lowest level in 35 years despite very significant population and economic growth over that period. However, progress is not fast enough. We simply need to do more, and we have to do it more quickly. That, obviously, relates to the energy issue.",
                "Ireland has faced real pressures on energy costs but the picture is improving. Renewables are now steadily reducing the cost of electricity. The Government is investing at a record scale to help families cut bills for good. Budget 2026 provides €558 million for energy upgrades and solar supports. If we maintain that, it will be the highest ever. That is a very tangible and effective way of reducing household bills eventually for a lot of houses. We have to keep at that, making homes warmer, healthier and cheaper to heat.",
                "I have just come from a meeting of the climate investment clearing house, which I established in this Government. The offshore wind agenda is absolutely critical. The clearing house brings regulators, industry and Departments together to identify the barriers and potential obstacles because it offshore wind is an economic imperative and opportunity on so many fronts. It is essential for energy security and to meet our climate goals. We simply have to deliver the offshore wind agenda. We are working extremely hard to do that. In parallel with that, we have to move very fast to create a strategic emergency gas reserve. I know there have been some critics of that, but that is fundamentally a security imperative. We are looking at how we can accelerate that in the time ahead.",
                "Budget 2026, the first of five budgets for this Government, reflects our level of ambition and commitment. It is the first step on the journey the Government will take to positively impact disabled people's lives and give them and their families support where they need it most. It has a strong focus on disability, including a record €3.8 billion allocation toward specialist disability services; a significant social protection package with increases to core rates and changes to income disregards for carers; a €3 billion investment in special education and the return of therapists to schools, that is, a school therapy service, which is working well; and a health schedule. The newly established disability unit in my Department will bring a renewed focus, urgency and weight to disability issues. In particular, the unit will look to further drive innovation and get things done, give momentum to policy implementation, improve delivery of services, troubleshoot, as appropriate, and encourage strategic thought on future challenges.",
                "In September, the Government announced its new ambitious target to reduce consistent child poverty to 3% by the end of 2030. In the budget, important milestones were achieved. It is the first year of a multi-year programme to achieve our target. We announced a significant increase in targeted income supports for low-income families as well as increased funding for targeted measures to support access and participation in early learning and school-age childcare through the new DEIS plus scheme and the roll-out of the equal start programme.",
                "In under seven months, on 1 July 2026, Ireland will take on the Presidency of the Council of the European Union for the eighth time. I met President Costa on Tuesday to go through the agenda and the critical items around competitiveness, values and the core issues, such as the multi-annual financial framework that we will be expected to bring to a conclusion during our Presidency, which will be critical for so many sectors of European issues but also Irish interests. We are very determined to resource and deliver a successful Presidency as it is an important opportunity for Ireland to lead the European Union's agenda and to shape the future.",
                "Enlargement will also feature during our Presidency. We are anxious to see real concrete progress on enlargement. Work is continuing across the Government to develop our priorities policy programme, taking account of the EU strategic agenda for 2024-2029 and the legislative programme proposed by the European Commission.",

We would like to see that done given the situation we are in and the level of capital investment that seems to be in place.",
                "On housing, we had large developers in. One of the issues they raised was the lack of zoning in large rural towns such as Clonmel and Tullamore. That is on the rural side. There is also the cost associated with construction and the potential for profit in the likes of Longford and Mullingar. There is a need for infrastructure in the commuter areas. We also need to tackle the electricity side of things, for example, as regards supply, the grid and judicial reviews. Then there is the issue of multi-annual funding for large-scale projects."

The reality is that is going to be a challenge due to numerous issues such as planning or the issue of judicial reviews. We currently have judicial reviews in place with regard to the proposed changes to planning regulations for apartments to try and unlock the 30,000 planning permissions for apartments which have not yet been utilised. There are other issues, such as the delay in opening up lands on the way to the airport for the metro north. The Shannon to Dublin water infrastructure project has been held up and has not been delivered. When we had Irish Water before the committee, its representatives told us that on certain days recently it did not produce enough water to supply the current number of homes in Dublin. How are we going to meet our targets to supply new homes if that infrastructure is not put in place? Is it time to do what we did when it came to the bypass for Adare? We put in significant investment to make sure the infrastructure is going to be there in time for the Ryder Cup. We need to bypass some of the legal loopholes that are holding us up when it comes to putting in the infrastructure we need to hit our targets.",

The Shannon to Dublin water programme is absolutely essential for the midlands and for the east coast. There are no alternatives in terms of sufficiency of water supply into the future. Again, that is a critical piece of infrastructure. One of the challenges facing us as an Oireachtas is that all Members will come under pressure in their constituencies in respect of some items that have been identified nationally from a macro perspective as essential for the country. Whether Members are in government or in opposition, the reconciliation of all of that is proving challenging on the energy, infrastructure and economic fronts. The bypass of Adare for the Ryder Cup is a good example, but, of course, it had gone through all the planning processes. During Brexit, significant infrastructural work had to be carried out on the ports, and we got it done. Dublin Port, in particular, had to be done quickly. People did what was necessary to enable that to happen. There was an emergency situation-----"

As a result, the legislation that has come before the Oireachtas has completely discounted what has been recommended by the committee.

We feel there is a danger that if there is no feeling of progress, the anti-EU elements within the accession countries are given a stick with which to beat those who are pro-Europe.

I want to update him on some of work we have done across the four pillars of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, namely, Anglo-Irish and North American; international, which is everything from Sudan to Ukraine and in between; development aid and development assistance; and the trade piece. The committee has just returned from Canada and the Taoiseach has been there himself on a trade visit, as has the Minister, Deputy Burke. Canada is very much open for business with exciting opportunities there. The Taoiseach's visit went down particularly well there and we are privileged to have a really dynamic ambassador on the ground there also and some very interesting initiatives are coming up there.",
                "In relation to a number of the issues that we covered, the impact of the loss of USAID in terms of the development agenda internationally has exercised the committee. We waived pre-legislative scrutiny on CETA, and I know that is before Government and will be coming back before the committee in January or February. We produced a report on the occupied territories Bill and made certain recommendations in relation to it. That is with Government. We had the EU Commissioner for Trade and Economic Security, Maroš Šefčovič, here. We were also dealing with the EU-Morocco trade piece.",
                "In terms of the EU Presidency, some of the things that we would like the Taoiseach to bear in mind include the sustainability piece, the climate action piece - they are issues that are brought to us - and the development aid piece.",
                "The final bit is in relation to the Middle East, where there is a fragile peace process, as the Taoiseach is more than aware. Ireland has some expertise in that peace space, from decommissioning to the drafting of complex peace agreements and achieving consensus. As a committee we think that is a space we would like to move into early in the new year. We would like the Taoiseach's response to that, especially in relation to Ireland reputation in that part of the world."

There is an all-Ireland approach to that, and this matters in terms of outcomes and quality of outcomes.

I can say that as a Minister I always accepted amendments to any legislation that were sensible and intelligent. Every Minister should have an open view and should accept amendments at all stages of the legislative process and should reflect on points that are made and should not offer knee-jerk negativity if good points are made. That is why committees are there, to see if there are agendas. It cuts both ways as there has to be a realistic assessment on the committee side as well as to what is possible. Sometimes things can be properly presented because they are good but it may not be legislatively possible, but it is to and fro. Yes, in short, we should be embracing the idea of amendments. I never brought a Bill through the House that did not change from the time it was initiated.",

The multi-annual financial framework will fall during our Presidency in terms of concluding parts of that.",

The education and youth committee had a very beneficial meeting on mental health supports in primary and post-primary schools with departmental officials, including some NEPS psychologists. Feedback we received from teachers, parents and students regarding the pilot counselling programme in primary schools has been very positive. The programme is unique in that the counsellors work with students in the school. Their work is complemented by the well-being education practitioners who work with individual students and educate all students about positive mental health through understanding and how to build resilience. It encourages a whole-school culture that supports well-being and negates bullying among the school community. Does the Taoiseach agree there is merit to rolling out the programme nationwide to all primary and post-primary schools? Post-primary students need even greater mental health supports. The current Neart programme at second level is a positive step but is being delivered virtually in classrooms. This is not ideal and it cannot offer the breadth and depth of supports needed by students.",

Will he consider establishing these links on a pilot basis so principals and teachers can work with CAMHS to help students and parents in need in a more structured way?"

The list goes on and on. These individual incidents have highlighted a general need to strengthen how the State oversees the spending of public funds. Our statutory framework for the Comptroller and Auditor General is outdated and inhibits the ability of the public accounts committee to play its role as watchdog on public expenditure. The 2020 independent peer review made it clear that limits on the C and AG's powers and independence must be removed. We need to operate according to a genuine follow-the-money principle, removing the 50% threshold that blocks inspections of many Government-funded bodies by the C and AG and the public accounts committee. All bodies in receipt of public funds, including local authorities and commercial semi-State entities, should fall under the remit of the C and AG. The Committee of Public Accounts must also have an expanded and clearer role and be empowered to act quickly on C and AG findings, conduct follow-up inquiries and hold any publicly funded body to account. Oversight should be proactive and not reactive.",

Third, will it commit to expanding the remit of the C and AG and the public accounts committee to enable oversight of all publicly funded bodies?"

The former Commissioner, Drew Harris, appeared before the committee in May 2024 and committed to 150 additional gardaí in our road policing units by the end of this year. Unfortunately, Assistant Commissioner Gunne confirmed in October that only 68 of these positions have been filled, leaving the number 82 short of 150.

There is real concern, and we are picking this up from talking to teachers, about positive mental health, mental well-being, anxiety and depression issues among children and young people. In any schools I visit, there is a strong focus on the various programmes to create a culture of well-being, mutual respect and people looking out for one another. I would be in favour of the pilot counselling programme being rolled out nationally. The well-being programme is effective and impactful. I will talk to the Minister on the plans for the Neart programme.",

There is the GP issue in terms of primary care being the referral mode but an exchange between the two would be useful. NEPS certainly has a role. I established that body when I was Minister for Education. The idea was to introduce psychology to schooling in a positive, proactive way, not a reactive way, and to spot things much earlier in the life journey of a child through learning. It is particularly important to always nurture self-esteem and self-respect in the child. These are good programmes which we need to resource more into the future.",
                "I could not agree more with Deputy Brady that we need to be very strong on spending, value for money and making sure we do not have overruns. Many of our projects do not overrun. Many are on time. Many Iarnród Éireann projects have been very effective. We need to, collectively and honestly as an Oireachtas, examine ourselves. One of the huge expenditure areas for the past two decades is the methodology we use for inquiries. They never end on time, in terms of the prescribed timelines that people allocate. We are talking about millions and millions. Is that the most effective way to allocate resources or to get the answers that undoubtedly are needed?",
                "We never question ourselves in relation to that. Whether in government or in opposition, people will instinctively call for a public inquiry on most issues, notwithstanding the length of time it will take and the costs involved. I fully accept the need in government and across the systems for ensuring value for money but do we as individual representatives in the Oireachtas, every single time we call for this, that or the other actually it check out? The whole idea of the Parliamentary Budget Office was to assist Deputies in costing but it has become different. To me, its remit has broadened. The original concept in Dáil reform in 2016 was that it would cost proposals and give a greater degree of realism in terms of legislation that is brought before the House asking for something, pushing an agenda or so on. There are costs behind everything we do. I welcome the focus on this but I would broaden it to look at ourselves in terms of what we all want, promote and so on, for a bit of discipline.",
                "I agree that RTÉ will come under the remit. We will look positively on the suite of reforms but I reserve the right to examine it in greater detail. There are commitments to expand the remit. We have to be careful of the degree. Are we going to bring in every sports club? We need to think through all of this. Sometimes, we go overboard. Some days, we have committees in here talking about overregulation and the next week the committees will want more regulation. We had the issue with Rehab in the past, when the Oireachtas did not cover itself in glory. The Oireachtas has not allowed itself to be open to accountability on this issue and how it happened, to be frank. We have to make sure we have enough bandwidth to do what we want to do in terms of the expansion. There are clear areas where there should be expansion in terms of the remit and there are also the issues of the capacity to do it and that the resources are there to do it.",
                "To respond to Deputy Murphy, the biggest move in road safety I experienced as a public representative was when Noel Dempsey, the then Minister for road safety, and the late Gay Byrne established the Road Safety Authority. They were unpopular within the Oireachtas because they proposed a whole range of legislative measures, which came through, on alcohol. I remember those fairly testy times and the reception they got but it worked in terms of the reduced number of deaths. This has been eroded somewhat, particularly post Covid. I do not have the full understanding of it. I believe we need to aggressively go at the road safety issue again, given the increase. We saw recently the report on the paediatric unit, which is very worrying in terms of e-scooters. The level of injuries among children and young people is shocking. We need to re-evaluate this. These are life-limiting injuries, according to the report, and what they are receiving in the hospitals demands reflection from us and, may I suggest, from the committee as well. We need to do more. There is no excuse. It is an unacceptable situation. We had 23,000 individuals failing to surrender their licences when the courts required it. It is extraordinary. The system clearly is not working and it has to change."

                "Many of the issues discussed this morning will persist until we have an Oireachtas that functions better. I have concerns about the functioning of the Oireachtas, as do others. At our last meeting of committee Chairs, we received a letter signed by 113 civil society organisations highlighting their concerns about the functioning of the Oireachtas. They highlighted that opportunities to contribute remained opaque, inconsistent and difficult to track in a predictable way. They highlighted that we were ranked fourth lowest out of 38 OECD countries in terms of engagement in developing primary legislation. They highlighted the very late notice given of upcoming Bills. I looked at the Oireachtas website and next week's schedule has not yet been published, so it is very hard for people to engage with it. This leads to a lack of accountability and transparency. State bodies are hard to hold to account when Ministers can, at times, be evasive, deflect responsibility and blame others. At times, this culture comes from the top. This is linked to issues with bureaucracy and a lack of productivity. We need to look at ourselves. We often call for productivity from others but we need to look internally. As a new TD, my assessment is that the Oireachtas is often dysfunctional. Take last night, when we sat until 1 a.m. as a matter of normal course with non-emergency business. I wonder what happened to a family-friendly Parliament. As the leader of the largest party and as Taoiseach, the Taoiseach has a role in setting the tone and leading the way as an example in terms of political reform. Political reform has fallen off the agenda. We need better engagement with civil society organisations and we need to enhance how we do our work here.",

Similarly, all Private Members' Bills are dismissed and rejected by the Government and not engaged with in a meaningful way. I welcome the change on this front."

I want to raise the issue of a potential tax rebate for some of our Olympic and Paralympic athletes. There is a rebate in place for sports people whereby, on retirement, they can reclaim 40% of their earnings from wages and prize money. This is great for rugby players who have good wages, and maybe for golfers and jockeys who have good prize money, but our Paralympic and Olympic athletes do not earn a wage and they do not win a lot of prize money. Perhaps we could potentially look at a similar rebate, perhaps at a lower rate, for the money they earn from sponsorship. In a lot of cases, this is the bulk of their earnings and they have to pay a huge amount of tax on it. The maximum amount of funding that carded athletes get is €40,000.

On 20 May, the Minister, Deputy O'Donovan, outlined in reply to parliamentary questions that the programme for Government contained a commitment to the arts capital programme. The sports capital programme, as the Taoiseach knows, is brilliant and it is working really well. Our committee would argue it needs to be translated to arts capital funding as well. The Minister, Deputy O'Donovan, detailed that €6 million was allocated for a new programme of capital funding for arts and cultural organisations throughout the country. The maximum grant available is €50,000 and this is not enough when it is considered that some towns do not have dedicated arts centre. Could we get a timeline for the scheme and when it will be deemed that it needs to be expanded?",

In my home place of Limerick, not one child has had an assessment completed within the statutory six months. This is zero out of 259 children. The recent announcement by the Minister for children involving the removal of the requirement for a professional assessment of need report for children to enter special classes has been described by the INTO, the union of the very people who teach and care for these children every single day, as a profound breach of trust. They say they were not consulted or notified of this intended change. They also said teachers were already under intense strain and could not be expected to absorb further major systems change, particularly when those were announced through the media rather than through formal channels of communication. With a formal diagnosis not being needed, will the Taoiseach clarify who will carry out these educational assessments? Will it be the teachers themselves? If so, this is a huge responsibility for those who are not qualified psychologists.",

The recruitment call did not work and there is a real need for a new one nationally that is promoted better. If the new campaign is not successful, we need to look at expanding it internationally. Does the Taoiseach agree?",

In contrast with many countries in Europe and internationally, we are one of the more supportive environments for participation in civil society. I do not accept the criticisms Deputy Rice articulated on behalf of some in respect of the Oireachtas, because I am a bit fundamental about the role of elected representatives. In previous Parliaments, there have been criticisms of encroachment on the fundamental role of elected representatives in policy formation and development. The balance has to be right. As individuals, we all engage with civil society and its organisations on an ongoing basis, but the balance has to be that legislation cannot emanate from civil society and perhaps the permanent public service, with all respect to the people on both sides of me. This is an issue. While always facilitating and nurturing civil society, we have to protect the fundamentals of parliamentary democracy in our electoral system.",
                "In the past, I witnessed huge opposition when we developed expansive programmes where elected representatives felt they were outside the loop. That is an ongoing challenge, but I would argue that we are close to and engage regularly with civil society. We are relatively unique in Europe in our electoral system of having parliamentarians who are close to the people on the ground engaging with people on a daily basis. Sometimes when parliamentarians come from other countries, they observe that they see engagement with people fairly regularly and informally.",
                "That said, I agreed last night that it was too late. It invariably happens towards the end of the year. It also happens because of our electoral system and because we are so close to the people. We tend to pack an awful lot into three days of the week. I was not the most popular person in my party when I was in opposition and suggested the Oireachtas should perhaps meet on four or five days of the week. In a previous Oireachtas, we had Friday legislation days. One day would be blocked off for legislation, not for Leaders' Questions and the theatrics that sometimes go on. I am not saying Leaders' Questions is theatrics, but committee members will know what I mean. We would spend one day on legislation and give it time. In other Oireachtas sessions, Private Members' legislation was allowed on a Friday, where an individual parliamentarian might have a particular topic to progress, so I am open to a more family-friendly Parliament. However, there is pressure on everyone in their constituencies, the Parliament, with their international obligations and on the Cathaoirligh of committees and trying to reconcile it all is always problematic. However, the audiovisual room is fairly constant as a facility for civil society. Anyway, we can discuss it another time, but I appreciate the Deputy raising it."

From previous experience, I know that the Department of Finance is always reluctant on tax relief and so on, but the Senator's point is valid, that some experience better opportunities through tax relief than others. Paralympians and olympians in general should be looked after and supported because their commitment and dedication and the subsequent roles they play post-Olympics as exemplars for young people and so forth should be rewarded.

I favour that and I will talk to the Minister about timelines.

A key issue that arose in those engagements was the multi-annual funding and budgets to be provided to the many community bodies that contribute to communities. Related to this, the European Commission has published its proposals, including €2 trillion in commitments for the 2028-2034 period. There has been much debate about the proposal on the integration of rural development into broader cohesion funds. On one hand, I welcome the simplification in this ethos.

It has been a long time in gestation and we were working on it in the previous Government. It is estimated 750,000 to 800,000 workers currently have no pension provision and this is critical in the future to provide pension provision. Close to over 400,000 people have registered so far which is a very good start. I ask everyone to work with it. People will complain about this, that and the other but it is essential for the workers concerned and for the long-term viability of the country with the demographic changes and so on.",

This is a big issue for Ireland and I am not too sure it is appreciated by Members of the Oireachtas just how big an issue this is. We have to negotiate hard and strong with the Commission and with other member states on this. We are a net contributor but we have big issues with the Common Agriculture Policy, Horizon and with rural and LEADER funding.",

It is ramping up the trade deals to counteract the US protectionism or tariff imposition by the US. We can do more trade deals. Interestingly, 72% of all trade is still under the World Trade Organization, WTO, frameworks, which is down from about 80%. The world has not collapsed and it is important to bear that in mind. As regards the cap in Dublin Airport, the Minister is bringing in comprehensive legislation to deal with that.",

A lot more are speaking Irish today than there were in 1922, which is a good sign. On supporting Gaelscoileanna, Deputy Ó Cearúil is correct that Wales is a very good example of constant innovation. At the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, it was creative industries Wales was pursuing and with the Welsh language, they have been very impactful and effective. We can do the same with \"An Cailín Ciún\" and other developments. There is great interest now in the creative industries in the Irish language. Ukraine asked us about identity and language and how they cultivate it in the context of its issues. Those are areas where Ireland can make an intelligent and informed contribution on how to approach language and so on. I hear the Deputy on the annual funding and I wish him well. His enthusiasm for the Irish language cannot be questioned."

The inland fisheries are looking for additional powers to prosecute at higher courts and the councils have not secured a single injunction or conviction for illegal peat extraction, which entails €40 million worth of irreplaceable peat effectively going abroad per annum. Is the Taoiseach concerned, from a Government perspective, on that front? How can Government sharpen the teeth of the regulators to give them more powers to deal with this?"

I ask the Taoiseach to examine composition. We have a couple of Leas-Chathaoirligh here today who may be taking the bad look off things or making things look a little better than they are. I mean no disrespect to them. We have an issue with regard to women representatives. The Government in particular has an issue. The Opposition, my party in particular, is doing a lot of the heavy lifting in terms of women Chairs. I am the Chair of the Joint Committee on Public Petitions and the Ombudsmen.

Usually, the people we see have been through every procedure and have done everything correctly. It is frustrating, as the Chair of the committee, to see that when we correspond and make recommendations, they seem to go into something of a void. That picks up a point made by Deputy Ward on the standing of recommendations of committees and the question of what we can do as committee Chairs to ensure recommendations we make are acted on. It would be very simple to say everything should go through the Department of the Taoiseach, because that is the way things might get done, but that is not the answer either. By the time people come to the petitions committee, they have exhausted every possible avenue and are incredibly frustrated. They might have a case or might not but they do not have anyone to say \"Yes\" or \"No\" to them and we can bounce around quite a bit. Therefore, any advice or steer the Taoiseach can give in this regard would be appreciated."

Belfast has been very successful. We now have two ports that will likely be able to facilitate large-scale renewables projects. We need more. The ports policy has to take that into account.

The first will come as no surprise to the Taoiseach today. The December Council begins and the fisheries quota negotiations for next year are under way. The entire committee and I were adamant that these negotiations needed a whole-of-government approach. We have said as much to the Minister of State, Deputy Dooley on several occasions. The industry is in freefall. The Taoiseach met with fishing industry representatives fairly recently. These negotiations are make or break for the fishing industry in Ireland and for our coastal communities. What we need is the Taoiseach as the Head of Government to play a role in these negotiations. A Minister is going over there against larger countries with larger fishing interests with senior Ministers around the table. Negotiating in a silo is not going to cut it to extract the concessions, the Hague preferences and the additional quota that we need. We need the Taoiseach as the head of Government and a whole-of-government approach. What will the Taoiseach be doing today and tomorrow to assist in those negotiations?",

I do not want to pre-empt his recommendations in that report that he will bring before the committee early in the new year, but picking up the mood of the committee members and my own assessment is that there is a deficit when it comes to accountability and transparency from that particular agency. That will necessitate legislative change. I would like the Taoiseach to look at that and to be supportive of those committee recommendations when they do come in the new year and to legislative.",

It is critical that we get the right balance between regulation and innovation. What is important in terms of our asks of the Taoiseach is to continue to provide leadership in this space, that the AI office, which will be established next year, will not be a thou shalt not office but one that will be facilitative and support SMEs and civic society organisations to meet their obligations under the AI Act, but also to ensure that Ireland becomes a leader in the adoption of AI in a safe way.",

We are aware that the Minister, Deputy Lawless is going to be bringing a number of proposals in that regard. We think it is critical that there is investment in upskilling and reskilling. As part of the EU Presidency, we want to ensure that Ireland positions itself as an AI leader but that in Europe's competitiveness agenda using technology and AI is a key part of that.

It is one of the reasons I initiated the establishment of the Department of higher education in 2020. It has the capacity to underpin future innovation and economic development. Research is key. The INSPIRE programme that the Minister, Deputy Lawless has announced recently represents the step change that I wanted this Department to engage in in the research space. It builds on the PRTLI model of an earlier period in the late 1990s and early 2000s. It will be critical in building a research infrastructure in universities. Universities are adapting a whole range of skills. The Deputy referred to green skills. There are also mental health supports within campuses. I am quite impressed with some campuses where there are better spaces, in terms of people who need to take time out of the hustle and bustle and all the noise and so on. We always need to watch the mental health supports in universities and further education that they are there for the students on an ongoing basis.",

The shared island unit stands ready to support that initiative and to be supportive of it. It is important to get the framework right and all of that. This is a great opportunity. I know the Deputy has been passionately advocating for this. We will take that on board.",
                "Deputy McGuinness spoke about fisheries. It is a core issue. I met with the group. To be frank, I engage with the Commission on a whole range of issues. We have to maintain a constructive relationship with the Commission. I have spoken to President von der Leyen in respect of the derogation on nitrates and the entirety of issues in agriculture. We will have to engage with the Commission on fishing. ICES research is saying it is overfished not by us, but by others that the European Union engages with. Non-EU countries are overfishing the entire area. It will mean a 70% reduction in the pelagic catch. That is on top of a 20% reduction as a result of Brexit. This is existential for the industry. We are going to have to go back to the Commission in respect of whatever supports we want to give from our Exchequer, which, at the moment, would have to take on board state aid rules, which I understand from talking to officials are quite restrictive in respect of what states can do. Given the exceptional nature of what is hitting the industry, we are going to have to be innovative and responsive.",

I take the Deputy's point. I am aware of that. Deputy Pat the Cope Gallagher and all the Deputies in Donegal, west Cork and coastal communities more generally are concerned about this because the impact on those communities will be significant. There are large concentrations of employment in Donegal, Castletownbere, Waterford, Wexford and so forth. We will await the outcome in terms of what the committee is proposing in respect of the authorities on transparency and all of that.",
                "On offshore, the Deputy can use the terms exploitative or extractive, but we need offshore renewable energy. Coastal communities should benefit and there should be a dividend for them. We have to go for it. If we do not, we are in real trouble energy-wise, climate-wise and everything else.",
                "Deputy Malcolm Byrne referenced AI, which connects in to the offshore issue. Our commitment to AI and our capacity to adopt AI will be dependent on having sufficient energy resources because AI is energy intensive. In terms of large energy users, future foreign direct investment will be critical. Regarding the Deputy's point on Government public services, we look forward to his committee's recommendations. I agree with his first-class idea around AI observatories. What we need to do, very quickly, is monitor the employment patterns because already there are signs that it is beginning to manifest itself in some parts of the economy. We need real-time monitoring of what is happening in terms of AI's impact on the jobs market. An interesting report we got from the expert group on future skills needs indicates that Ireland is actually very high on skill levels and our AI competency per capita is one of the highest across Europe but we need to build on that. That is a good news story but areas like energy are less so.",
                "Public service adoption of AI is critical, as the Deputy said. We are working on enhancing digital public services and supporting enterprises to accelerate their use of digital technologies. There is a whole programme on digital public services aimed at 100% digitisation of key public services and driving responsible AI adoption across the public sector. The Minister for Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation, Deputy Chambers, has a significant programme in that area, again related to productivity gains within the public sector and better delivery of public services. We want to be a location of choice for ethical AI and digital start-ups and a global hub for innovation.",
                "I take the Deputy's point about the balance between regulation and innovation and that is something we have to work very hard on. The perception is that in Europe the balance is on the regulatory side as opposed to the innovative side. The Commission is trying to correct that with its investment announcements in respect of AI factories and so on. We are trying to piggy-back onto that and be part of that process. It is a transformative area, of that there is no doubt. There will be bumps along the way and highs and lows in respect of this but there is no doubt that the technology will improve, refine and develop. We cannot just put our heads in the sand. We cannot put our heads in the sand in relation to data centres either. We have issues now in terms of energy but data centres are not the great evil. They are a reality of modern life and modern societies and economies globally. That is just a reality but there are limits to what the grid can do at any one time. That is why the offshore wind revolution has to happen. Ireland is probably one of the leaders in integrating renewables onto the grid because of our experience in onshore wind and because of our work in solar. The Oireachtas needs to grapple with this too. When I am in the Dáil, I hear comments about that wind farm, that gas station or that anaerobic digestion facility but equally, we have a more national problem of how to replace fossil fuels with renewables. It is a real challenge for everybody because we must have energy to run the country and to maintain people's high-quality livelihoods.",

We are lucky that we have an excellent committee comprised of members, both Government and non-Government, with huge experience within the Defence Forces and they take their responsibilities really seriously.

The committee is seeking to have its remit extended to cover all aspects of national security. As per Dáil Éireann Standing Order 109(3), the committee has reviewed its procedures and its role and is making the request in this context. The committee also notes that other sectoral committees, such as the Joint Committee on Fisheries and Maritime Affairs, have a remit which covers aspects of more than one Department. The committee considers that given that national security is in its title, its remit should extend to all aspects of oversight in the area and not just those under the Department of Defence. I am sure the Taoiseach understands what I am saying and I ask him to have a look at this issue in the context of the geopolitical turbulence and challenges that we are all facing. He said he was very much in favour of protecting the fundamentals of parliamentary democracy and in that vein, I ask him to look at the remit of the defence and national security committee and to enable us to do the job that needs to be done."

The Cabinet made the decision on 12 July that year to establish the committee, which goes to the point he made about gold-plated EU rules and regulations and the examination of those. That committee's original title was the committee for the scrutiny of EU-related draft statutory instruments but we have tightened it up and it is now the committee on EU scrutiny and transparency. The work of the committee includes getting the draft statutory instruments before the Minister signs them and making sure they are passed on to the relevant sectoral committees to give them an opportunity to scrutinise them in advance of them being signed. It also includes examining issues that would affect us in relation to the Windsor Framework or the impact of EU proposals on legislation that would impact our relationship with our big trading partners such the UK, EU, US and Canada. It also includes the big issue of fines. I will give the Taoiseach an example. This is the directive that came in on organ donation. It is 16 pages long. By the time the Department of Health was finished adding to it, the document was 36 pages long. It had to be amended subsequently because it was so badly drafted.",

He is correct that the intimidation, coercion and fear are big worries, when people see people dealing on the streets and creating their territory. It is injurious to normal life and the quality of normal life. It creates a fear and tension in communities and there has been violence and aggression. In many ways, it is an informal subjugation of a community. We will talk to the Garda in regard to a tougher line on this. We are constantly increasing the numbers of gardaí. There is already a steady throughput in Templemore that is enhancing our capacity to police in a more visible way on our streets. That is an important dimension to it as well.",

We will discuss that with the respective committees in regard to what is coming before the committee. There are maybe two areas where there is huge and significant simplification going on with legislation at European level. Sometimes we look at all of this as a fait accompli. We are looking at the end of a cycle and maybe we need to look at stuff earlier in the cycle to see if we can make inputs before it becomes a directive and before we are at the legislative transposition stage. Invariably, when that happens, we are up against a clock that is ticking in regard to fines and public servants are saying if we do not get this over, we could risk a fine. There is new agenda now, however, in regard to simplification, and a desire to try and reduce regulation to some degree in various industries and sectors of the economy. Maybe that is something we should intervene early on. There is a reverse way of looking at this."

May they both rest in peace and may their memory guide our response through this moment of darkness. I visited the scene and it is something I will never forget. A room recently alive with an excited young heart giddy with the joy of Christmas, toys imagined, stockings planned and innocence undisturbed now stands as a haunting reminder of a future robbed. The silence was heavy. The air felt cold carrying the memory of a terror no child should ever face.",

In that moment, the darkness of what has happened will become real in a way none of us ever wished to witness.",

They ask themselves, \"What am I doing wrong?\" Young people see this and believe it is success. However, the truth is not glamour. It is terror, drug debt, threats, children being groomed into criminality. It is soulless, selling misery, addiction and violence for profit. It destroys families, businesses, relationship and hope. It underpins so many of the issues we debate in this Chamber - housing, poverty, mental health, domestic abuse, crime and inequality. The raw reality of that world without filters or fantasy burnt a four-year-old child alive on Saturday. That is the cost; that is the truth.",
                    "While nothing can undo this tragedy, we can influence what happens next. I have complete confidence in the gardaí. They will find those responsible. When they do, the full weight of the law must land heavily on them. Justice must be seen, and justice must be felt. However, justice must also mean prevention. It must mean restoring confidence, protecting children and rebuilding peace.",
                    "I sincerely acknowledge the work the Minister for justice is doing in his Department in terms of gardaí recruitment. It matters and I thank him for that. However, given what has happened in Edenderry, I ask the Minister to request the Garda Commissioner to examine the establishment of a dedicated task force for Edenderry focused specifically on dismantling drug-driven criminality. I am not directing but I am respectfully asking that it be considered.",

They deserve the right to enjoy the simple things like sitting in their own sitting room to watch television without fear. We owe that to Mary and little Tadhg. We owe that to every resident in Edenderry."

I join An Garda Síochána in appealing to anyone with information to come forward. The gardaí have given assurances they will relentlessly pursue the violent and dangerous criminals for this murderous attack. They will be brought to justice. I appreciate that this incident will be shocking to people in the community in Edenderry and across the country and may naturally give them pause for concern about their own safety. I reassure them that the gardaí are following a direct line of inquiry and they have a strong record of bringing dangerous and violent criminals to justice.",

                    "The Deputy mentioned Garda resources. The Government is investing record amounts in An Garda Síochána to ensure the Garda Commissioner has the resources he needs to tackle the illegal drugs trade. A Garda budget of €2.59 billion for next year will fund the recruitment of up to 1,000 new gardaí, 200 more Garda staff and a doubling of the Garda Reserve to over 600 next year. A total of 794 garda recruits entered the Garda College across 2025, the largest intake in a year since 2018. Significant numbers of gardaí have attested from the Garda college throughout this year and as more probationary gardaí attest across 2026, all communities will see a benefit as they are assigned out to their stations.",
                    "Ultimately, the Commissioner will make the decision on where Garda resources are assigned but the Minister is assured that a number of factors are taken into account, including crime trends in an area, demographics and local resourcing requirements. I assure Deputy McCormack that in relation to the heinous and murderous act we saw at the weekend that resulted in the tremendously tragic and unacceptable loss of lives, no stone will be left unturned. Every avenue will be explored to make sure that those responsible are brought to justice."

Deputy McCormack's point in relation to Garda resources in Edenderry and Offaly is massively important. I understand that at the end of October, there were 399 gardaí assigned to the Laois-Offaly Garda division, a 45% increase on ten years ago. They are also supported by 51 Garda staff who provide really important support to gardaí and free them up to focus on front-line policing duties. Eight probationary gardaí were assigned to the Laois-Offaly Garda division this year and 12 probationers were assigned last year. It is also worth noting that An Garda Síochána operates a divisional model which means that it uses all of the resources within the division, not just the Garda station within a particular community, to respond to local demands on the service it provides.",
                    "We can see throughout our communities the damage and devastation that organised drug crime groups heap on society, not least in Deputy McCormack's local community over this past weekend. Tackling the issue of drug-related intimidation is a high priority for An Garda Síochána. Nominated Garda inspectors are available throughout the country through the drug-related intimidation reporting programme to assist victims of intimidation. In addition, the drug-related intimidation and violence engagement, DRIVE, project, which launched earlier this year has established effective systems for assisting those affected by drug-related intimidation. There are over 400 publicly-funded drugs services, including family support services, across the country which can advise and support people affected by drug-related intimidation. Family support services are critical because drug-related violence nearly always becomes an issue for the whole family. There is more information available for anyone who needs support on the [driveproject.ie] website",
                    "I thank Deputy McCormack again for raising this today and assure him that the Minister for Justice and Home Affairs and the Garda Commissioner will do everything they can do bring the people responsible to justice."

                    "The warmer homes scheme is supposed to protect the most vulnerable households in our society, including older people, low-income families, people living alone and those wholly dependent on supports like the fuel allowance. Right now the scheme is failing them and it is about to get far worse. I will outline the current reality. On 4 November this year my office contacted the SEAI on behalf of a vulnerable client who applied for the warmer homes scheme in October 2024. Almost 14 months later she is still awaiting a survey or an allocation. The timelines are staggering. It is taking 14 months to get a survey, 26 months for works and another three months for post-works inspection. This is not a functioning scheme. We already have 20,000 homes on the waiting list. The Minister of State knows as well as I do that these are not discretionary upgrades. These are essential measures for people at risk of fuel poverty.",
                    "The critical point that I want to emphasise is that the number of people on the fuel allowance, the key qualifying criteria for the warmer homes scheme, is expanding dramatically. From next year those on the working family payment will be eligible. That is an additional 50,000 households, bringing the total number of fuel allowance recipients to more than 500,000. If nothing changes, the warmer homes scheme waiting list will surge even further because eligibility will expand faster than delivery capacity. This is not a projected problem; it is an inevitability. The SEAI currently has no action plan, no surge capacity, no backlog reduction strategy and no timeline for clearing the existing 20,000 cases. Money is not an issue but delivery is and telling people that we have increased funding is meaningless if funding does not translate into workers on roofs, contractors on the ground, insulation going into walls and people living in warmer homes.",
                    "When will a full, published action plan be produced to address the backlog of 20,000 homes? What contingency planning has been done for the additional 50,000 homes that will become eligible under the expanded fuel allowance scheme? Will the Government commit to a maximum six-month waiting time for a survey for any applicant on the fuel allowance? Will the Department intervene directly to ensure that the SEAI increases contractor and surveyor capacity immediately? We cannot keep telling vulnerable people to wait three winters for a warmer home. We cannot expand eligibility by 50,000 households while pretending the scheme can cope as it stands. This requires urgency, action and leadership now, not later."

                    "I thank Deputy Murphy for raising this issue today. The climate action plan includes targets to retrofit the equivalent of 500,000 homes to a building energy rating, BER, of B2, cost optimal, and the installation of 400,000 heat pumps in existing homes to replace older, less efficient heating systems by the end of this decade. The national retrofit plan sets out the Government's approach to achieving those targets. The programme for Government 2025 contains a number of commitments in relation to retrofitting. They include delivering more B2 equivalent home retrofits each year from 2026 to 2030, with a focus on lower-income households, improving the provision of grants and financing models for home owners, including older people who wish to retrofit, enhancing energy efficiency and reducing costs, as well as supporting group retrofitting projects.",
                    "The warmer homes scheme aims to improve the energy efficiency and warmth of homes owned by people at risk of energy poverty by providing fully funded retrofits. The scheme is operated by the SEAI on behalf of the Department and is funded through carbon tax receipts and the European Regional Development fund, ERDF Last year saw a record spend of almost €230 million under the scheme.",
                    "As reported by the SEAI, this resulted in 7,743 upgrades being provided to lower-income households. This year's budget includes an allocation of €250 million for the scheme, which is a €50 million increase. That represents an elevenfold increase on the 2020 expenditure figure.",
                    "The scheme has been delivering a greater number of deeper and more complex upgrades in recent years, and this is reflected in the average cost of upgrades, which the SEAI indicates has increased from €2,600 in 2015 to over €29,000 this year. These deeper upgrades mean that more lower-income households are benefiting significantly from warmer, healthier and more comfortable homes with lower energy bills and reduced emissions.",
                    "With regard to waiting times, which I know are key to the point the Deputy is making, increased awareness of the multiple benefits of retrofit and improvement to the warmer homes scheme is driving increased levels of demand for the scheme, with just over 45,000 applications received over the period from January 2022 to the end of October 2025. Over the same period, more than 24,500 homes have been upgraded under the scheme. We had 45,000 applications and in the same period, 24,500 homes were upgraded.",
                    "For homes that have been allocated to a contractor for works under the scheme so far this year, the average waiting time was just under 15 months. Once a home is allocated to a contractor, the completion times can vary based on the types of works being undertaken at a home and the lead time for ordering and delivery of materials and products, such as windows, are factors. Homeowner availability for upgrades in their homes can also be a factor. The average waiting time from application to completion of upgrade works to date in 2025 has been 21 months for the worst performing homes and 22 months for better performing homes. It is important to note that these averages represent a significant reduction since the first half of 2022, when the average waiting time was 27.5 months.",
                    "The reduction in waiting times follows a range of measures introduced by the Department and the SEAI, including the allocation of additional staff to the warmer homes scheme, a significantly increased budget allocation and active contract engagement with management by the SEAI to increase contractor output, as well as actions to address ongoing supply chain pressures. A pilot delivering additional homes from the warmer homes scheme waiting list under the energy efficiency obligation scheme was introduced last year.",
                    "Importantly, the SEAI launched on 8 December a procurement process to establish a new €1.2 billion contractor panel to be in place by quarter 2 next year. This will support continued growth, with a focus on scale, quality and output under the scheme. Department officials continue to work with the SEAI to further accelerate and maximise the output of fully funded energy upgrades with the objective of minimising wait times."

People came into my office in quarter 3 of 2024 and as of now, 14 months later, the SEAI cannot tell me when these homes will be surveyed. I have people in their 90s who applied in quarter 3 of 2024. They will not be alive when their house is due for a survey.",

Nothing will change for people who are currently waiting for years for essential upgrades and insulation. I cannot understand why we cannot get the surveys done quicker. Not every house needs a heat pump or a new set of windows. Sometimes houses just need insulation. I cannot understand why we cannot deliver insulation upgrades within six months. The expansion of the fuel allowance to those on the working family payment would see a surge of 50,000 new houses qualifying for the warmer homes scheme. If we expand eligibility without expanding delivery capacity, we will simply deepen frustration, lengthen queues and worsen energy poverty.",
                    "There are, I say again, 20,000 homes on the waiting list. If nothing changes, these numbers will only go in one direction, which is upwards. I am telling the Minister of State that I will be here again next year and there will be 30,000 homes on the waiting list. It will take 16 or 18 months for a survey. It will take more than three years for full completion of works and vulnerable people cannot wait for three years. We need a backlog reduction task force, emergency procurement of surveyors and contractors and a fast-track system for the elderly and particularly high-risk households. This is about dignity, fairness and the basic right to a warm home. We need timelines, capacity and an action plan or the scheme will continue to fail the very people it was created to protect. People in their 90s who applied in quarter 3 of 2024 will not be alive when their houses are due for a survey."

There has been a massive increase in the number of applicants, which is obviously putting on pressure by way of demand.

                    "The other challenging factor that is influencing waiting time is the fact that deeper retrofits are taking place. That is reflected in the increase in cost from €2,500 ten years ago to €29,000 now. That is reflecting the fact that a lot more is happening whenever a retrofit is taking place.",
                    "The important piece, which will have a positive influence and will help to address the important point the Deputy is addressing, is the fact that the SEAI has put in place the procurement process for the new warmer homes contractor panel, which commenced in recent months. It is anticipated that it will attract additional capacity for the programme over the next four to five years. That tender carries an estimated value of €1.1 billion, representing a record programme of commitment for that five-year period. The SEAI expects to have the contractor panel in place for quarter 2. Its objective will be to support that continued growth with a focus on the scale, quality and output.",
                    "The SEAI also continuously monitors the performance of all contractors operating under the warmer homes scheme, including in relation to the quality, level of complaints, timelines and general administration.",
                    "I will certainly feed back the Deputy's key points to the Minister and the Department. I will emphasise the importance of ensuring that capacity continues to increase."

The picture on the front page shows four young women. I compliment the journalist, Ms Sandra Quinn, and the Limerick Leader for what they put out. Sometimes a visual says more than words. The story is about Ms Aoife Johnston and Ms Niamh McNally, both 16, Ms Eve Cleary, 21, and Ms Leona Cusack, who was 33. They all died because of what is going on in UHL.",

I spoke recently about a situation where I had to ring and somebody in the HSE told me once I got on the motorway to go to Portlaoise hospital, which I did. That was an emergency and the patient got fantastic service. The Government has a huge decision to make. In fairness, the Minister, Deputy Carroll MacNeill, has said she will make that decision next week. She met mid-west Deputies and Senators two weeks ago. Unfortunately, for some reason, Deputy Sheehan and I were not invited so I must raise the issue on the floor of the Dáil.",

The idea that the people in Clare, Limerick and north Tipperary have only one accident and emergency for 450,000 people is insane. The only decision that can be made next week, along with option A of the 96-bed block and option B of building a 100-bed unit nearby, is to make the decision long term. We need ambition to have a model 3 or model 4 hospital in the mid-west.

We have a worrying situation where consultants, because of the working conditions, are leaving. I urge the Minister of State to give the Christmas news everybody in Tipperary, Limerick, Clare and even parts of north Cork want to hear and that is that we will do all the short- and medium-term planning and we will look again at the pathways regarding minor injury units and open them up as well as open up community services but for God's sake, we need another hospital in the mid-west. It is as plain as the nose on my face. Any other decision is discrimination and is totally wrong. I will be the first person to stand up and congratulate the Minister of State if she delivers it."

I acknowledge UHL is still the busiest hospital, with a 10% increase in attendance this year compared to the last year. I had a conversation with senior management this morning and they are on track to receive 100,000 attendees to the emergency department this year. Mitigation pieces are in place regarding senior clinician decision-making and de-escalation of the emergency department, with a good length of stay averaging at four and half days. Thankfully, mortality is static and currently in line with every other hospital.",

They serve the communities of Ashtown, Navan Road and such new communities as Pelletstown. They are great schools. I have had the opportunity to visit them. I have met the student council of St. John Bosco school and I had the chance to see just how run-down those old buildings were.

They have a definitive plan for how the students would move out of sections of the old school, how those sections would be demolished and how the new school would be built across the site over a period. However, there has been a real blockage in the schools getting past the notorious stage 2a of the Department's processes. This was an election issue in the general election this time last year and, as soon as I was re-elected, I asked a parliamentary question of the then Minister in February this year. There was due to be a meeting between the schools and the Department back in March. That was cancelled quite abruptly.",

Despite having significant notice from the school design team, the Department did not allocate any time or resources to review the documentation when it was received. A meeting had been scheduled by the design team with the Department in anticipation of progressing the review, but again, the Department cancelled the meeting and informed the schools the documentation would now not be examined until after the new year. This is extremely disappointing, particularly given the three schools were explicitly assured that this project would move to the next phase in the first quarter of this year.",

I know and the school knows that the Department school building team is under real pressure, but it is now more than a year that these schools have not been able to get past stage 2a. The school and its design team are working quickly and efficiently and are keeping the Department up to date on progress at every stage. However, the Department is not replicating that level of engagement. These three schools, St. John Bosco Junior Boys School, St. John Bosco Senior Boys School and Mary, Help of Christians Girls National School, need a firm date as early as possible from the Department on which to meet the design team, agree the addendum report and let these schools progress to the next stage. Can the Minister of State give me a firm date for when this meeting will take place?"

However, due to a scope change to include an increase of classrooms for children with special educational needs, it was decided that new school buildings would be provided. The design team submitted the initial stage 1 report in April 2023 and, following the submission of an addendum report in August of that year, the project was approved to move to the next stage.",
                    "The design team submitted its stage 2a submission report to the Department in January 2024 for review. Upon review, some key concerns were identified by departmental officials and the school authorities and design team were advised in advance that, in place of the stakeholders meeting, there would be a further interim stage 2a workshop to discuss and assist the design team in progressing its stage 2a submission in a positive manner. The design team was asked to complete a review and audit of the floor area schedules and to refine some design elements in order to meet the approved schedule of accommodation. A further interim workshop was held on 22 March 2024 between the Department and the design team architect, where further refinements and adjustment to floor area were discussed.",
                    "Upon receipt of the revised stage 2a report, departmental officials carried out an initial review and arranged an architectural workshop with the design team lead in May of this year to discuss it further. In early June 2025, a further meeting was held with the wider design team, school authorities and departmental officials in attendance. At that meeting, the school was provided with a progress update and advised that the design team was due to submit an addendum stage 2a report to the Department. The outstanding information for the addendum stage 2a report was received in the Department on 31 October 2025. Departmental officials will carry out a full review of the addendum report and the stakeholders' meeting will be scheduled once the review is completed.",
                    "In July, the Government announced a capital allocation of €7.55 billion for the Department of Education and Youth for the period 2026 to 2030 under the national development plan, NDP. As part of this NDP allocation, the Department will place a strong emphasis on provision for children with special educational needs, with a particular focus on meeting annual school place needs. The approach to project roll-out for large-scale projects and additional school accommodation scheme projects will be to continue to maximise the capacity of the existing school estate as much as possible in the first instance and provide necessary additional capacity through targeted and prioritised project roll-out over the course of the 2026-30 period to meet the most urgent and prioritised needs."

In the speech the Minister of State read, we see that the initial stage 1 report was submitted in April 2023 and it was followed by a stage 2a submission report in January 2024 and a workshop in March 2024, and then we jump to another workshop in May 2025. My concern is that this is not progressing with the degree of haste the situation in these schools requires.

This has seen 1,300 school projects completed. In 2025 to 2026, 80% of new special classes are being facilitated in repurposed classroom accommodation, so there is particular pressure in respect of addressing that need. Departments, including the Department of education, are currently in the process of publishing their sectoral NDP implementation plans. The sectoral plan for the Department of Education and Youth will be published next week and the first tranche of projects to progress to construction will be published in January 2026. This NDP implementation plan will optimise outputs from the national development plan allocations, with a strong focus on maximising existing school capacity, progressing priority projects where local capacity across schools and areas is insufficient and ensuring delivery that is affordable, offers value for money and meets functional needs.",

                "The Minister of State and I both know that Ireland is a nation of dog lovers. We love our dogs and we love our pups but the reality is many people in Ireland would be absolutely horrified if they knew what the back story of those pups was. They would be disgusted to know that those pups came from a nightmare situation the pup's mother is probably still living through. It is where a pregnant female dog can be bred over and over again in horrific conditions that are dirty, cramped and cold, often with not enough water or light, and where she is matted, covered in sores and not getting any care, love or human interaction. That dog is just seen as this production line to pump out pup after pup.",
                "These terrified mother dogs are breeding absolutely terrified pups. What happens in that instance is not only does the mother dog have horrific health problems but the pups have horrific health problems and often have behavioural issues. Those pups are sold to families who are so looking forward to having this gorgeous little bundle of joy in their home. Instead, they get a dog, a little pup, that has never been socialised and may never have had much human interaction because these pups are often fed by automatic machines. This pup then becomes a difficulty and a real challenge for these families, one they are sometimes not able to deal with. It is a conveyor belt of misery and it has huge animal welfare concerns.",
                "Puppy farms are a profit model gone absolutely mad. It is a real example of an industry that can gain a huge amount of money at the expense of vulnerable animals but where there is not sufficient oversight of regulations. Rescues are left to pick up the pieces of this and they are exhausted. They are tired and finding it so hard to deal with the number of pups and dogs that are being abandoned at the moment. These are all run by volunteers. They are the ones who get the mother dogs who arrive matted and terrified into their care. They are the ones who get the puppies who are too old to be cute any longer and therefore the breeder cannot sell them, so they dump them. They are the ones who get the puppies that are brought in by families because they were given up due to health or behavioural issues. It is all down to a lack of regulation.",
                "Many people will be very surprised and shocked to learn that, at the moment, there is no cap on the number of female dogs that can be in a puppy farm. The legislation envisages there are over 300. It would be incredible to have that many breeding females and their pups on-site. Not only that, there is no mandated number of staff required to be there to look after those pups. We can really see where the difficulties set in. Female dogs can have up to six litters in their lifetime. Dogs as young as four years old, when they are only puppies themselves, can be forced to have their own pups. The dog welfare Bill the Social Democrats are bringing to Second Stage today strengthens the 2010 Act by capping the number of breeding females on-site at 30. It introduces a 16-month minimum age and eight-year maximum age for breeding; a maximum of one litter per year per breeding female; a maximum of four litters per breeding female during her lifetime; a minimum age of ten weeks for pup separation; and mandates a one to ten staff-to-animal ratio for proper care. It also outlaws surgical artificial insemination and other harmful practices.",
                "This is a modest Bill. We are not coming into this Chamber saying every single puppy farm in the country should be shut down. We want them to be properly regulated and we want the welfare of dogs and pups to be at the centre of this. This Bill will go a long way to ensuring that we are caring for those dogs properly. I am interested to hear what the Minister of State has to say. I hope that the Government can work with us on this. It is something that has huge support from the public and that they really want to see happen. I thank Dog Law Ireland for its support for this Bill, as well as Dogs Trust and Wicklow Animal Welfare, which I have worked with very closely over the course of this. I also give a shout-out to all those rescues who put in so many hours looking after our animals."

Something many people are not aware of is that we are the puppy farm capital of Europe. Thousands of dogs are exported from here every year and flown all over the world. It is ridiculous, cruel and incredibly lucrative. We need restrictions on the number of breeding dogs and the number of litters they can have over their lifetime. Without that, the system will continue to encourage breeders to push dogs way beyond their limits. We all know what the consequences of that are: dogs kept in appalling conditions and not getting the treatment they need; dogs who spend every waking minute terrified and in pain; dogs who are not socialised and have serious behavioural issues; and puppies that are born into simply horrendous conditions.",
                "The current staffing guidelines are absurd. It is recommended there is one staff member for 25 breeding females. If each of those has a litter of six, we are talking about one person being expected to care for 175 animals. That is not animal welfare; it is systemic neglect. Dogs need care and attention. They need to be fed, watered and loved. No one person can provide that for 175 dogs. Breeding standards should prioritise welfare over profit. Anyone working in animal welfare will tell you the same thing because they are the ones who are picking up the pieces of a system that encourages people to mass-produce animals like they are products to go on a shelf. Rescues are held to strict standards. They face inspections, audits and endless paperwork and scrape by on tiny grants from the Department of agriculture. Meanwhile, another arm of the same Department gives out breeding licences with almost no limits. How can a Department demand rigorous standards from those saving animals while giving free rein to those churning them out? It is completely ridiculous.",

During the pandemic, she took out a loan and used her pension to cover the costs to do this. That is who this broken system leans on. People like Anita hold everything together while puppy farms flourish. We need to fix this and we can. We need to cap the number of breeding bitches, restrict the number of litters, fix the staff ratios and fund rescues properly. If we want to be serious about dog welfare, we need to catch up and we need to do it now."

This is in advance of what it and many other rescues will see in the swathe of animal surrenders, mostly dogs, in January and February of next year.

In the audiovisual room yesterday, Dogs Trust told people about the state of the mother dogs and puppies that come to them when rescued.

I am also imagining the joy of somebody getting a little puppy at Christmas - or any time of the year but apparently it happens a lot at Christmas. I do not agree with this because dogs are for life and not for Christmas, as one advertisement used to tell us long ago. When puppies have that shocking start to life, they have a reduced chance of survival. If a puppy is failing to thrive, imagine the huge vet bills a family could wrack up trying to save the little thing's life, and then it dies. If children are involved, there will be absolute heartbreak. I am a mother of four and we have had pets that reached the end of their lives. It devastates children, but this is preventable. Deputy Whitmore's Bill sets out to prevent cruelty against poor puppies and their mothers having lives that are absolutely awful. It is a start in that process."

We have a proud and long history in our mythology and society of a wonderful relationship with dogs. Unfortunately, we also have a history of cruelty to animals in this country. Less than six months goes by in any year, and we hear of some conviction, investigation or a tragic case of animal cruelty being uncovered. These disproportionately involve dogs. Dog farms are not the only area of animal cruelty. We see it in fox hunting, the treatment of greyhounds by unscrupulous people, dog fighting and the inhumane treatment of farm animals.",

It should be known in this House that the psychology of those who harm animals and exploit them is often a precursor to more violent and exploitative actions against other humans. It has been very well documented across the psychiatric profession and in research that if one is cruel to small animals in particular, it is a leading indicator of cruelty, antisocial behaviour and disorders. In particular, cruelty towards dogs can often be a precursor to sociopathy. This Bill is crucial in addressing human behaviour, ensuring we are good stewards of the animal kingdom and especially for those we call our best friends. At its core is also the question of how a society should behave. How we treat animals is how we will eventually treat our planet, our fellow human beings and, indeed, ourselves.",

There is a natural cycle of things, yes, and of how animals are predators and prey, eat and are eaten, are part of our domestication and are undomesticated. That natural cycle can be twisted to the cruel and inhumane. That is a reflection of us, of our humanity and our role in a planet we share with the animal kingdom and, ultimately, of who we become.",
                "Let us be the best version of ourselves, the one that values and cares for dogs and other animals, one that prevents cruelty and does not tolerate it, one that corrects injustices and does not turn a blind eye, one that ensures that we live up the better angels of our nature, our humanity and the concert in which we live with all living beings. Let us make sure we make Ireland a great place for dogs."

I hope we can work together to implement it. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Heydon, has asked me to relay his apologies for being unable to be here this morning, and to clearly state that the area of animal welfare broadly, as well as that of dogs specifically, is of utmost importance to both him and his Department.",
                "On behalf of the Minister and the Government, I am putting forward a 12-month timed amendment to the Dog Welfare (Amendment) Bill, a Private Members' Bill, the reasons for which I will outline.",
                "The Government fully recognises the significance of this policy area. The timed amendment allows time for the deliberative processes relevant to the area we are discussing, and that are already in train, to reach their conclusion. The Minister is confident these processes will come to a landing zone that will be well aligned with many of the principles of this Private Members' Bill, as introduced and clearly and passionately articulated by Deputy Whitmore.",
                "Before I reference those processes, I will provide some background information and context with respect to the issues at hand. Deputies will be aware it was a programme for Government commitment that the somewhat disjointed approach to dog control issues be addressed by ensuring all legislation and policy in relation to the control of dogs, dog welfare and dog breeding establishments rest with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. In this respect, it is positive to be able to report and confirm that policy responsibility for dog control was transferred to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine from the Department of Rural and Community Development and the Gaeltacht, with effect from 1 June 2025, and for dog breeding establishments on 1 August 2025. It is important to note that local authorities retain responsibility for all operational and enforcement matters. They have the power to appoint dog wardens, provide dog shelters, seize dogs, impose on-the-spot fines and take court proceedings against owners.",
                "The Government's commitment to this area is exemplified by the enhanced funding across a number of streams. The Minister asked me to reference near-term funding initiatives in the animal welfare space, including the provision of the now annual tranche of funding to qualifying animal welfare charities, which include several dog charities. Furthermore, the Minister was also pleased to recently confirm that local authorities will continue to be resourced into next year, to the tune of €2 million overall, with respect to the retention or appointment of additional dog wardens in 2026.",
                "Coming back to the proposed 12-month timed amendment to Deputy Whitmore's Bill, the rationale for this is to allow for sufficient time for the Minister and his Department to consider the outcomes with respect to two deliberative processes that are ongoing in this area, both of which will inform policy and legislative considerations from public, stakeholder and expert perspectives.",
                "The first is a public consultation process, which is ongoing, to inform consideration of the next Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine animal welfare strategy for the period 2026 to 2030.",
                "At the launch of that public consultation last month, the Minister indicated that animal welfare is a topic of enormous and growing importance, both to farmers and to the broader public in respect of how society values and treats all animals, including dogs. He went on to say that as the bar in respect of animal welfare continues to rise, he wants to hear opinions and how his Department's next animal welfare strategy can put Ireland on a best-in-class footing with comparator countries, while maintaining the progress, as evidenced by our achievements to date.",
                "Moving on from the second deliberative process, the Minister asked me to highlight, with respect to the policy specifically on dog control and breeding, that a high-level dog control stakeholder group was established in 2024 to consider policy and legislative matters in dog control, breeding and welfare areas, which includes consideration of legislative provisions under the dog control Acts and the Dog Breeding Establishments Act. The report and recommendations of the dog control stakeholder group are anticipated in early 2026. The Minister is awaiting the deliberations, report and recommendations of the group, which has been meeting quarterly to consider numerous issues in the dog control and breeding space, including, but not limited to, legislative change.",
                "The Bill set out by Deputy Whitmore focuses on the specific aspects of policy that have formed part of the deliberations of the dog-control stakeholders group, and in particular the work of one of the sub-groups which, as part of the process, has spent significant time specifically focusing on dog-breeding establishments. The Minister hopes and trusts that Deputy Whitmore will accept his modus operandi when he asked me to relay that this timed amendment put forward by the Government is less about the merits or demerits of her Private Member's Bill, as proposed, and more about the Minister acting in the future upon processes that this and previous Governments set in train. The Minister has indicated he is very happy to consider the need for legislative change in this space and will engage proactively with all interested parties in doing so.",
                "I want to compliment Deputy Whitmore. I heard her outlining the purpose of her Bill on \"Morning Ireland\" this morning. She has a lot of support on this side of the House. I am an avid dog lover myself. I take in rescue dogs. In the little area where I live, there are more dogs than people. I know Deputy Whitmore is very passionate about this, and I know her party is very passionate about it. It is an area that has to be addressed, and it has to be addressed soon. I know the Deputy is anxious that something be brought forward before the 12-month period. We will push to do that, but I will ask that the officials meet with Deputy Whitmore and brief her on where everything is at and make sure she is consistently contacted and kept informed on what is happening. I would like us to work together. I know the Deputy is very passionate about reducing the time. I cannot give a commitment on that now, but I will ask the officials to meet with her and see if we can reduce the timeframe on that. I will get back to her on that. If I can get back to her before 12 noon, I will. I thank the Deputy for bringing this Bill forward; it is a very important one. I hope the House and the Government will be able to bring something forward fairly soon."

While I welcome that the Government is not outright opposing this Bill - I do appreciate that and we all welcome it very much - I have to say it is frustrating and disappointing because we hear this line consistently from the Government that we do not put forward solutions, and yet the last three pieces of legislation this party has put forward have all been served with timed amendments. They are not complex pieces of legislation that would require the Government to do that. To me, it really feels like these are being kicked down the road, unfortunately, when essentially there is no reason we cannot progress to the next Stage and deliberate more fully. I would say the same of our previous Bill, which was to reduce the voting age to 16, for which we know there was Government support from certain Members, and of our Bill that originated in the Seanad to provide free transport to victims of gender-based violence. As a new TD, it is something that really stands out for me.",
                "When my team and I meet voters in Rathdown, we are always meeting people with dogs. These are pets that are treasured family members. They are vital companions for many in our community. They are well cared for and loved and they enjoy safe homes and kind treatment. However, not far from the border of my constituency, at Mount Venus Road, many animals are cared for by the NSPCA. These are dogs that have experienced the most cruel treatment and neglect. Although we love our animals, we have to do better in protecting them, and this Bill allows us to do just that.",
                "Ireland has earned a shameful title as the puppy farm capital of Europe. It is not a badge of honour; it is a stain on our conscience. The Bill put forward by Deputy Whitmore will end the cruelty, secrecy and profiteering that has defined this industry for far too long. Every year, 30,000 puppies are churned out like products on a factory line. They are shipped from Dublin to places as far away as Singapore, and while the puppies are sold for thousands of euro, their mothers are left behind in cages, forced to repeat the cycle again and again until their bodies give up. This is not farming; it is the mass production of misery.",
                "The Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010 was supposed to protect animals but instead it opened the floodgates. Many councils appear to have handed out licences rather than confront the logistical challenges of seizing dogs. This legislation is facilitating, instead of regulating, large-scale commercial dog breeding, and now Ireland has become the world's supplier of designer puppies - cavapoos, pomskies, cockapoos; cute names masking ugly realities. Obtaining a licence to breed in Ireland does not guarantee animal welfare. A fully-licensed farm can have one staff member responsible for 175 dogs and still be in compliance. We have seen dogs living in piggeries, fish boxes and their own filth, and we have seen puppies sold online, only to drop dead within weeks because of bad breeding and a terrible start to life. Families are then left heartbroken, children traumatised, and the animals themselves suffer unspeakably.",
                "While the cruelty is obvious, the economic crime is hidden. Tens of thousands of dogs are sold each year, often for €500, €1,000 and €5,000 each. Much of this trade is unregistered and untaxed. This is money that could instead be funding inspections, veterinary care or public services. This unregulated puppy farming is not just animal abuse; it is a thriving black market. We cannot keep pretending this is a niche problem. It is a €120 million industry. It is global and growing. If we do nothing, Ireland will continue to export cruelty for profit. If we act, Ireland can show that we genuinely care about animal welfare. A puppy is not a product. A kennel is not a factory. Animal welfare is not optional."

                "I am very proud to talk about this animal welfare Bill because it also gives me an opportunity to talk about my dog, who I have been dying to talk about in the Chamber for a very long time. My dog is called Ethel and she has no problems in life. She gets walked several times a day and she gets the comfiest bed. Sometimes she allows me to sit on the couch. This dog has no issues at all. However, about two and a half years ago, she got gastroenteritis. She ate something in the park, got an upset stomach and was brought to the vet. The vet up in Cabra treated her amazingly but gave her a little shot in the back with a little needle. Every day since that day, when she walks past that vet, her stride hurries, her tail goes between her legs and she starts to shake a little bit because that was a time in her life when she knew a little bit of pain. I think about that when I consider the context of this Bill to address female dogs being forced to breed constantly from the age of six months, which is incredible to think of. I think about the emotional pain as well as the physical, because these are emotional beings. They are emotionally intelligent. My dog knows when I am not having a good day, so she definitely knows when she is not. I think about the dogs who are in these kennels being forced to breed constantly, as if they are a factory churning out litters. The inhumanity of that is something that sticks with me when I think about the kindness of all of our pets and little animals. We should be rushing to remove that from ourselves. The length and breath of this country, one will find people whose pets are part of their family. The idea that Ireland remains the puppy farm capital of Europe is unconscionable to that little being that sits at our feet and shares our food and home. We need to act with as much pace as we can.",
                "Let us work collaboratively on this because it seems to contradict what we all know. Ireland cannot continue with these puppy farms. It cannot continue to have a greyhound industry, which, while a separate issue, is also seeing dogs destroyed constantly. We have to do better because these pets are little friends at home. We cannot continue to have another side industry in which exploitation, cruelty and harm are built in. I want to work with the Minister of State and I know Deputy Whitmore wants to work with him and the Minister, Deputy Heydon. Let us do that quickly."

It is important to say that the Government is prone to frequent whinging that if only the Opposition could make constructive suggestions instead of complaining, it would happily work with us. This is patently shown up here, as with so many other Bills, for the disingenuous claptrap that it is.",

This level of fragmentation ensures dog breeding remains essentially unregulated and wide open to abuse.",
                "It is estimated that around 100,000 puppies are bred in Ireland each year. Irish people love dogs and are willing to invest significant sums of money to welcome a puppy into their family. Unfortunately, this demand is very often exploited by some breeders who prioritise profits and care not a jot for animal welfare. Many puppies and their mothers are born into miserable, nightmarish environments where they may be kept in confined spaces with inadequate light, limited human contact and substandard care, including restricted access to food and water. Deputy Whitmore’s Bill represents a first step towards regulating breeding operations and providing protections for puppies and their mothers. The Bill proposes limits on the number of breeding females, the age at which dogs can breed, the age at which puppies may be separated from their mothers, the implementation of staffing ratios and a prohibition on surgical artificial insemination.",
                "I will focus briefly on surgical artificial insemination. This procedure carries welfare and ethical concerns, including risks associated with general anaesthesia and surgical complications. Non-surgical alternatives are widely used internationally and are not associated with many of these risks. The UK, Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands have banned surgical insemination for welfare reasons and the Veterinary Council of Ireland’s code of professional conduct also discourages its use on ethical grounds. This is just one aspect of Deputy Whitmore’s Bill, but one that highlights the far-reaching favourable impact the legislation could have on dog welfare. The question that remains is why the Government is deferring this Bill for 12 months. I can so reason other than political pettiness."

It is an appropriate time to introduce it given the work being done by the stakeholder group to look at all of these issues. The Government is talking about kicking the can down the road, as it does with so many of the Bills that come before the House. We all need to recognise that we have a difficulty in Ireland when it comes to puppy farming. That said, my understanding is that there is considered to be a market in Ireland for approximately 50,000 puppies per year, about half of which come from registered puppy farms.",
                "To be a breeder in Ireland, you have to have more than six bitches. An awful lot of the people who are providing or selling pups have one or two dogs. Usually, they love and care for their dogs very well, particularly in those small environments. However, that is not always the case. There are always dogs in those environments that are looked after very badly. I have some experience of this. We had dogs at home and I remember the pups coming. On one occasion, they were Irish wolfhounds. We are up at night watching the dogs and waiting for the pups to come. This went on for two nights in a row and when they were born, we had to get a box with a red lamp in it, similar to a small incubator, and put the pups into it to keep them warm. We had to get up every two or three hours and feed the pups because otherwise the bitch would lie over them and possibly kill them. We had to be there with them all the time. It is an intense thing to do. I cannot imagine how difficult that must be if someone has 30 bitches. Of course, that would not be happening to all of them at the same time, but it is a big operation in those circumstances.",
                "My understanding is that there are fewer than 20 breeders in Ireland who have more than 30 bitches. While the number is quite low, that does not mean these operations do not need to be regulated and intensively monitored. A limit is certainly needed but that needs to be worked out. The Bill refers to a figure of 30 and maybe there are arguments around that. We need to hear what those arguments are and see what the situation is.",
                "The number of pups going to the UK has been very large for the past ten to 15 years, although I think the figure has gone down somewhat in recent years. That is part of the work the stakeholder group needs to do. I know it is meeting and doing work on that. We need to get reports from the group and accurate data to know exactly what is happening, how it is happening and what is in place around the country.",
                "Of course, there are circumstances in which people are very careless in how they look after these animals and see them only as a means of making money. In my experience, the vast majority of people who breed dogs are not like that. They care and work with the dogs and follow up after they sell a pup, ringing the buyer a month later, six months later and a year later to ask how the dog is doing. They have an affinity with the dogs and look after them very well. That is reflected back, and we hear that from the vets, the people who know what is going on. In most cases, they are also the people who will sound the alarm and let the authorities know when there is a problem. In fairness, the local authorities and county vets in most areas are active. The county vet in my area is extremely active in ensuring that things are done properly and there is not the kind of abuse we have seen in the past and which is happening now to a limited extent.",
                "The proposals in the legislation are apt, particularly around insemination. There are issues there that clearly need to be dealt with. The Minister of State said he hopes to deal with this legislation within the year, if not sooner. The sooner the better because it needs to get absolute attention. Everyone, in every corner of these Houses, has an affinity with dogs. People love their dogs and have a great sense of companionship with them. We used to always say that no matter whether you came home in good humour, bad humour or whatever way you were, the dog would come to welcome you wagging its tail. They are always there to welcome people. That sense of affinity we have with these animals will, I feel, give us the strength, as a community and a nation, to ensure we have adequate legislation in place, including on following up. There is no point in having the legislation if we do not follow up and implement the regulations to ensure animals are treated properly. This has to be done with authenticity and must not be something that is swept under the carpet or hidden away.",
                "The number of bitches a person needs to have registered to be a breeder may need to come down. Numbers and limits need to be put in place with haste. I hope the Minister and Government come forward with measures very soon."

For too long, the absence of a cap on the number of breeding females has created the conditions for large-scale puppy farms, where animals are treated as units on a conveyor belt rather than living beings with needs and instincts and the right to basic care and welfare. Sinn Féin has been very clear that the current regime is being abused, albeit by a minority of operators. Without a statutory limit, establishments can accumulate very large numbers of breeding bitches with no realistic capacity to provide proper welfare. A cap of 30 breeding bitches is necessary to end the worst excesses of intensive dog breeding operations. As has been noted, without proper regulation and staffing levels, no individual or small operator can manage the welfare of 30 females and their many pups, never mind the far higher numbers we know exist in some facilities around the State. This Bill both acknowledges that reality and seeks to remediate it.",
                "We also strongly support raising the breeding age. Allowing pups to be bred from six months old is entirely inappropriate. They should be left to mature. We want to see the minimum breeding age increased to 15 months. Furthermore, pups must be allowed to remain with their mothers for at least ten weeks.",
                "The current practice where pups are separated after only a few weeks in order to bring the bitch back into breeding condition is harmful to both mother and pup. A statutory ten-week mother and pup period is a basic welfare requirement and long overdue. The introduction of a staff-to-bitch ratio of 1:10 is also welcome and without that clear staffing requirement, welfare obligations cannot be enforced in any meaningful way. Proper oversight, staffing and inspection regimes are needed if we are to be in any way serious about ending cruelty and exploitation.",
                "I want to address the issue of surgical artificial insemination. The changes to the code of professional conduct for veterinary practitioners have already recognised the welfare concerns involved. However, the continued exemption for greyhounds is not justified. The same welfare standards should apply to all dogs and Sinn Féin believes the law must reflect that.",
                "We have seen it in the last Government, which was dubbed the kick-the-can-down-the-road Government, and it is unfortunate to see that, despite the new injection of Independent Deputies into the Government benches, this is continuing. We saw it with wind turbine regulations last week and we see it with this piece of legislation this week, where the can is kicked down the road. I understand the points the Minister of State outlined in his speech to allow that discursive element to take place but we need to grapple with this issue now. This Government is 11 months ar an bhfód and we need to get to grips with this. I ask the Minister of State to allow this to go ahead."

                "I am delighted to speak in support of this Bill on dog welfare. I am a proud mammy of two beautiful fur babies, Benji and Frankie Byrne, and I was half tempted to hold up their pictures here today and ask how anybody could be so cruel or neglectful to little creatures like that. The Long Title of the Bill reads: \"An Act to provide for animal welfare considerations in the operation of dog breeding establishments, including but not limited to a cap on the number of breeding bitches, the age of bitches allowed to breed, the age of pups when removed from their mothers, a staff-to-bitch ratio, and to prohibit the use of surgical artificial insemination [That is, apart from greyhounds].",
                "There is nothing that makes me cry quicker than to read about the poor treatment of dogs and the breeding of bitches and puppies on some of the so-called puppy farms this legislation seeks to address. Any true dog lover knows just how much attention a pup needs, never mind a litter of puppies or multiple litters. The fact that there are currently people out there keeping multiple mothers and litters in unsanitary and unsupervised premises in 2025 is just unbelievable. The Bill puts on a statutory basis the need for a staff-to-bitch ratio of 1:10. Personally, I think that should be lower but we are here to support this Bill.",

However, this does not apply to greyhounds, and I and Sinn Féin believe it should also include greyhounds. Leave the pups with their mothers for the first ten weeks. Let them play and be fed, watered, nurtured and looked after properly until they can make someone the happiest person in the world when they are picked up and brought to what is hopefully their forever home. We need to close any sort of loophole that could be exploited with regard to animal care but we support the Bill."

It could have gone further but I respect that the Deputy is trying to make a really big first step, which is important. We are now being recognised as the European capital for breeding dogs and pups. There are a lot of things we want to be top of the list for in Europe but that is certainly not one we want to be seen as, especially when we are a people renowned for our history with dogs. I was listening to other people talk. The joke in our house is that I go home on a Thursday evening and when I go in the door at whatever time it is, 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock, our little dog Coco is waiting at the door for me shaking her tail off. My two daughters are shouting \"Hi Dad\" down the stairs and my wife Michelle is probably busy doing something. There is a special bond. I remember when we got Coco I was running in the by-election. I came home one night after canvassing and she was in the kitchen with my two daughters and my wife. Michelle said to me, \"Sure you are out canvassing anyway and the girls will have Coco while you are out\", and what could I say.",
                "I have had dogs all my life and so has my wife. A dog is like a family member. I know some people might condescendingly ask, \"What do you mean by that?\" but for anyone who has a dog, there is a special bond when you have a dog in your house. I know sometimes when my daughters are doing exams and when they are down, if the dog is upstairs, she is up in one of the bedrooms. There is a bit of comfort in having that companionship and only a dog can give it sometimes.",
                "I welcome this Bill. It is really important. Another point I want to make is around the housing crisis and the number of people getting evicted. People ask what that has got to do with dogs and breeding. A lot of people who go into emergency accommodation cannot take their dogs with them, so they either have to give their dogs to a family member or give them away. These are consequences of the housing crisis and homelessness. A lot of landlords now will not take dogs. I am not sure if it can be included in this Bill or in another piece of legislation but I believe people need rights to bring their pets with them, obviously in a controlled way. They should not be barred from renting accommodation because they have a pet or a dog. We want to see these proper regulations. We do not want to see some of the horrendous things that are happening with breeding at the moment.",

People have evolved and there is a lot more respect for dogs among the vast majority of people but there is a small minority and they cannot be let get away with it."

In any industry, when there is no regulation, it can lead to a wild west situation where anything goes. This is particularly worrying when it comes to animal welfare.",
                "The legislation around current dog breeding practices is being abused. For example, as was mentioned, there is no cap on the number of breeding bitches that a breeding establishment can have. I really do not like using the term \"bitch\", so I will call them \"mother dogs\". For example, as the Deputy said this morning, you could have up to 300 mother dogs on one puppy farm. We have heard reports of how the mother dogs are being kept in cages. We have heard how they are being fed by automatic feeders. They are lying in their own excrement and they are not getting any socialisation whatsoever.",
                "Breeding practices within these puppy farms frequently lead to serious health issues for the puppies. These practices can lead to genetic disorders and infectious diseases and the lack of human interaction can result in significant behavioural issues. These inhumane conditions not only cause immense suffering for the dogs but also contribute to the broader issues of overpopulation and the abandonment of unhealthy or unmanageable dogs. More often than not, it is dog rescue organisations that have to pick up the pieces.",
                "New owners of puppy-farmed puppies and dogs can have a hard time when they bring their dog home, with illness or unwanted behaviours. It can lead to additional costs for the owner and also additional expenses in regard to veterinary care and the emotional turmoil of seeing a dog and puppy in distress and being unwell. Nobody wants to see this. Nobody wants to see an owner having to give up their dog. My partner has a beautiful whippet called Padmé. I will give her a second name like Deputy Byrne did. We will call her Padmé Murphy. She is a rescue dog - a beautiful dog who had a really difficult start in life. She is boisterous and energetic. She is full of energy and an absolutely beautiful character. She brings so much joy into our lives and as was mentioned before, the welcome you get from a dog when you walk in the door is second to none. I would love to see my children copy the dog and give the same welcome I get from Padmé when I come in. I would never stand up here and call Padmé a \"bitch\". My life would not be worth living. In fact, I just about get away with not calling her a baby. I hope I will get a few brownie points for bring her up here today as well.",
                "There are so many other dogs out there that do not get the same chance in life that Padmé has had, in being brought into a loving home. Despite some issues at the start of her life, she has a loving, warm home where is part of the family. It is horrific to think that there are businesses and puppy farms out there that are making huge amounts of profits on the back of overbreeding puppies and dogs. We need to put regulations in place to make sure this does not continue. I know the Minister of State mentioned kicking it down the road."

They were left with multiple scars from C-sections and some were so ill-treated that they were matted with their own faeces and they had to be sedated to be groomed and to enable them to give birth.

Ireland is in the midst of a dog welfare crisis. That is not a phrase that I use lightly. Today, more than 3,000 dogs are in pounds and rescue centres across the country. Every week we hear of rescue centres overwhelmed, a foster network stretched to its limit, and of families heartbroken after discovering the hidden cruelty behind their family puppy due to an industry that has gone unchecked for far too long.",

Despite the tireless work of staff and volunteers, 340 dogs were euthanised. It could have been prevented from ever reaching this point if our laws were fit for purpose. The shameful truth is that, as has been said, Ireland has become the puppy-farm capital of Europe. Up to 30,000 dogs are exported each year into illegal markets abroad. When we include unregistered backyard breeding, that figure may rise to 100,000 puppies bred in conditions that range from inadequate to outright cruel.",

Yet, it is our animal welfare charities, operating on shoestring budgets, that are left to pick up the pieces. They are the ones dealing with the endless stream of neglected, sick and traumatised dogs. Countless animals are suffering the consequences of poor and irresponsible breeding, and far too many are being euthanised as a result.",
                "In some of the large-scale breeding operations, there can be as many as 300 pregnant mothers at any one time. Females can be bred from as young as six months old and are forced to give birth again and again, with little regard for their health or well-being. The puppies themselves often come into the world deformed, sick, or burdened with long-term physical and behavioural issues. A puppy should be cared for, nurtured and held during the first crucial 12 weeks of life, not treated as a commodity to be produced for profit.",

Backyard breeders continue to operate with virtually no accountability.",

Stout suffered from severe health difficulties caused by malnutrition, poor breeding practices and the appalling, unsanitary conditions in which he was kept. Despite every effort by the Wexford SPCA, Stout lost his life last August. However, because two people, Tara O'Connor and Kevin Keegan, refused to let Stout's suffering be in vain, his legacy lives on. They have led a compassionate and determined campaign, rallying animal lovers across the county, the country and beyond, and called for legislation that holds breeders accountable and centres animal welfare in every aspect of dog breeding. They have a campaign called Stout's law, which proposes that we finally recognise dogs not merely as personal property, but as living beings with intrinsic needs, with the right to comfort, proper care, and the ability to express normal behaviour.",

My colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue, our spokesperson on agriculture, which animal welfare falls under, has also begun to process a Bill after hearing about Stout's law. He recommends a cap of 30 breeding females per site; minimum and maximum breeding ages; a limit of one litter per year and four in a lifetime; a staff-to-animal ratio of 10:1; a ban on surgical artificial insemination; and updated fees to reflect higher welfare standards. Additionally, the Bill includes criminal penalties for breaches - fines up to €250,000 and imprisonment of up to five years for serious offences.",
                "These are not unreasonable demands. They are the minimum standards required for ethical breeding. We are calling for Stout's law to be incorporated into Deputy Whitmore's Bill. This would strengthen the legislation by establishing stricter limits on age and the duration and conditions of breeding; limiting lifetime litters; creating an independent regulator with real enforcement powers; supporting local authorities in oversight; outlawing backyard puppy farms once and for all; and ensuring transparency and accountability at every step. Stout's law would ensure that welfare is not an afterthought but the foundation. It would ensure breeders have a legal, moral and enforceable duty to provide freedom from discomfort, distress and neglect, and freedom to behave as dogs are meant to behave.",
                "Rescue centres should not be forced to pick up the pieces of an industry that profits from suffering. They should not be dealing with litters born with degenerative conditions, malnourished mothers or traumatised animals that have known nothing but stress and confinement. We have a serious animal welfare problem in Ireland and we have a responsibility - morally, socially and legislatively - to confront it. By supporting this Bill and incorporating Stout's law within it, we can send a clear message: that Ireland no longer tolerates cruelty behind closed doors; that compassion must outweigh profit; and that the welfare of animals is a reflection on the values we hold as a society.",
                "Stout did not survive but his legacy can ensure that thousands of other dogs do. It is time now to reform our laws, to strengthen enforcement, to protect vulnerable animals and give Ireland a dog-breeding system we can be proud of. I urge everybody in this Chamber to support the Dog Welfare (Amendment) Bill 2025 and formally incorporate Stout’s law into this legislation for Stout and for the countless dogs suffering and that will continue to suffer if we do not act upon this now.",
                "Before I close, I want to highlight one more emerging concern. I spoke recently with the DSPCA about the worrying rise in kitten farming and the growing demand for fashionable breeds fuelled by viral trends on social media in creating large profit-driven breeding operations where appearance is prioritised over animal welfare. I have seen this myself on countless occasions on social media. Kitten farming may be less widely recognised than puppy farming but the suffering it causes is every bit as real. We must also get ahead of this issue before it becomes another real problem.",

                "It is really important that we be clear about the central question we are debating here and will vote on tonight. This is a law that seeks to reduce cruelty to dogs. It is important for the hundreds of thousands of dog owners and lovers in this country who know the innate sense of injustice and fury when they see or hear of a dog being mistreated. I have heard that sense from many of the Deputies who have contributed already today but it is important for those dog lovers to know that this Bill will be delayed tonight for 12 months. Law that would lessen cruelty to dogs in this country will be kicked down the road for a year. I want to thank Deputy Whitmore for bringing forward this important Bill and we in the Green Party will support it.",
                "Commercial-scale dog breeding is not something I will pretend to have any regard for even with regulation in place. It is an industry that prioritises profit over welfare where profit is the product of how efficiently and at how large a scale litters of puppies can be bred and born. That is why Deputy Whitmore’s Bill is so welcome. It seeks to amend a piece of legislation that was introduced by my former colleague, John Gormley, when he was Minister in 2010, which was the first measure to attempt to regulate the factory-like breeding of dogs in Ireland. At that time, that particular law was strongly supported by animal welfare groups and by veterinary campaigners. Fifteen years on from that law, the measures being proposed in the Bill today are absolutely necessary to ensure we have an effective, humane regulatory system in place where dog breeding is taking place.",
                "In particular, I welcome the proposed measures to regulate breeding practices that would address some of the physically extreme practices that can cause significant suffering for dogs, like a minimum age for breeding, like a maximum number of litters per year, like an annual breeding limit and a minimum age for separation. Perhaps most critically, it looks to outlaw the horrendous practice of surgical artificial insemination. I know this was something Deputy Quaide focused on in his contribution and it is an issue on which I have been raising parliamentary questions in recent months. Surgical artificial insemination is an issue that is long past time for action. The Veterinary Council of Ireland has already updated its code of practice to include a prohibition on canine surgical artificial insemination across all breeds, including greyhounds. It is banned in the UK and New Zealand. It is an absolutely unnecessary procedure that inflicts significant pain and creates a risk of infection to the dog to simply maximise litters and ultimately profit. It must be banned by statute and that ban must be enforced. Any breaches must carry strict penalties and that ban must include greyhounds as well.",
                "Of course, what has always been remarkable to me is that when it comes to legislating for animal welfare in Ireland, it is the people who are firmly on the side of change. People in Ireland are shocked to hear about some of the practices that take place on animals in our own country. It has always been my experience that the vast majority of Irish people, rural and urban alike, want a humane regulatory system in place that seeks to put the welfare of animals at its heart but every time it comes to actually making even a small change, the political fight is entrenched. It is vitriolic. Those proposing changes are attacked and it is escalated into some sort of perverse city versus country culture war. That is done as a very deliberate tactic. I remember in 2010 when the Green Party introduced the puppy farming regulation Bill and a ban on stag hunting, the money and effort that were put into AstroTurfing a lobby was absolutely incredible. People should be in no doubt about the difficulty with which legislating to improve the lot of animals is resisted politically in this country. Again, what always amazes me is that opposition to change is coming from tiny, unrepresentative interest groups. Although they are unrepresentative, they are able to generate such noise that the larger parties bend to their will every single time. It is essential that this Bill, or an identical version from the Government, be passed during the lifetime of this Dáil. I do not accept the justification for a 12-month delay, and I will oppose that delay tonight, but in 12 months' time when the Bill does advance, the Green Party and I look forward to supporting Deputy Whitmore in advancing it and seeing it passed."

We need to stop cruelty to dogs and there is no doubt that the area of dog welfare needs to be more formally regulated, especially in the area of dog breeding establishments like puppy farms. In August 2023, the then Department of Rural and Community Development released statistics that showed that 7,352 dogs entered Irish pounds. That was a massive 77% increase over 2021. Twice as many dogs were euthanised in 2022 over 2021. The Dogs Trust recorded the highest number of surrender requests - 3,968 - since it opened in 2009. The number of dogs rescued by the Irish Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals rose by 47% last year over 2022. Staffing, or more correctly the lack of staffing, is a significant issue in these establishments. Our poor, almost non-existent regulatory system has resulted in a €200 million industry and this country becoming the puppy farm capital of Europe, exporting a significant number of puppies to more regulated countries.",

                "An issue that does not appear to be covered in the Bill and is not implemented under current legislation is the whole area of enforcement. There is little point in having legislation and regulations if they are not being enforced. We recall the light-touch regulation in the building industry over the years. There is effectively no enforcement of current licensing or microchipping regulations. There is a complete under-resourcing in this area with little or no staff or infrastructure including pounds. This is resulting in a large-scale cohort of unlicensed and unmicrochipped dogs. These dogs often run in packs and are a danger to the public, especially children and the elderly. Of course, it also involves a lot of significant income to local authorities. Immediate and significant steps must be taken to address this issue and it is an area that should be included in this legislation as it proceeds through the Oireachtas.",
                "The current dog breeding situation is not humane. It is effectively cruelty behind closed doors. The Government's response to the Bill is to kick it down the road for at least another year and probably for an awful lot longer. This is not good enough. I ask the Minister of State to reconsider this unacceptable response."

There are good breeders in the country doing good work. Equally, there are some horrendous practices happening in the country. Therefore, it is only right that we seek to introduce a minimum standard.

Preventing overbreeding, age limits for female dogs, a minimum age of pups for separation and staff ratios are all really important.",

Many of them are pedigree dogs and many have come from the breeding sector. This is quite incredible. The number of dogs euthanised in the country is increasing, and it has increased by 10% over the past year. I thank the shelters throughout the country. In my constituency, Mayo SPCA in Ballyhaunis is run by Ms Marian Biesty, a wonderful woman, and a team of volunteers. They do tremendous work. I have visited it many times. Ms Biesty won Mayo person of the year recently and it was very well deserved. North West SPCA in Ballina is also doing great work, as is the Mayo dog pound in Castlebar. This Bill would relieve some of the challenges and pressures these dog shelters face. I urge the Minister of State to prioritise this and to work with those on this side of the House to make sure that minimum standards in the industry are addressed.",

I attended a meeting recently where I spoke to a young farmer who lost half his pedigree stock overnight. Several were savaged by dogs and others were caught in ditches, drains and rivers on the farm. The Bill would assist with this. I am particularly keen to ensure we have a system whereby the microchipping of all of these dogs and enforcement happens.",

The Bill will assist with this but there are significant steps we need to take on sheep worrying, microchipping and ensuring gardaí have the ability to protect farmers."

Leading organisations across Ireland have issued strong warnings about buying dogs from breeders during the festive period. The ISPCA has highlighted that puppy farmers exploit the Christmas rush, producing litters in poor conditions without proper care, vaccination or microchipping. They urge families to delay purchase until after the holidays and to consider adoption from registered rescues instead. The DSPCA, speaking on RTÉ, warned about heavily discounted puppies being sold for as little as €100. Many of these dogs lack vital vaccinations and are at risk of serious illness, such as parvovirus. Its advice is clear, and it is that if people do buy, they should have the puppy examined by a vet within 24 hours and check all health records.",

If someone is ready for a dog, they should choose a reputable source or give a rescue dog the gift of a loving home. We all know the saying that a puppy is for life, not just for Christmas. I pay tribute to people who look after dogs. In Church Cross in west Cork, the Collins family look after retired greyhounds. The incredible care they give to their dogs needs to be commended and I commend them. I have been there with them and I would nearly be encouraged to stay and sleep in one of the dog beds because it is such a beautiful layout. They give the dogs great attention and care.

I have called for: a single, centralised dog microchipping register; a distinct tax code for dog breeders; regulation for online sales, and increased sanctions for dog breeding and welfare violations. This is not just a matter of dog health and welfare, but also consumer protection and public safety, as poorly bred and poorly socialised dogs are more likely to exhibit antisocial and aggressive behaviour. Fine Gael has always stood for strong animal welfare protections. Recent developments include how the State now funds over 100 animal welfare organisations, with funding increasing from €2 million in 2020 to over €6 million today. We have established a new and independently chaired advisory council on companion animal welfare and there have been improvements in dog control, with additional funding for dog wardens in all local authorities.",

As we are all aware, planning for the updated animal welfare strategy 2026 to 2030 is under way.

We need to allow time for these processes, which are near completion, to be completed. Capturing the range of stakeholder, expert and wider public views with the new EU-wide minimum standards will form the basis for an updated animal welfare strategy, which will be published in 2026. Taking this time matters for improving the health and welfare of dogs. Taking this time will improve public safety and public confidence that dogs in our communities are well raised and cared for.",

The Minister is very happy to consider the need for legislative change in this space and engage proactively with all interested parties in the context of the completion of the evidence-based and stakeholder-driven processes that are in place to inform these considerations by the Minister and the Department.",

The Department and the Minister are committed to engaging further, with a view to implementing changes in due course."

I was sitting this morning with my cat, listening to Deputy Whitmore on \"Morning Ireland\", and the cat meowed at me. I think she meowed in approval, though I am not quite sure.

There are some lovely seanfhocail, drawing on dogs, which give wisdom on life in general. One for example is, \"Is dána gach madra in ndoras a thí féin\", which means \"every dog is daring on his own doorstep\". Another one is, \"Ag cur madraí i bhfuinneoga\", which means \"putting dogs in windows\", which actually is a phrase to describe attempts to distract people.

The idea that dogs and other animals are somehow separate from humans is something that a lot of people are trying to challenge. Many see this separation between us when there is none. They are part of us. We are all living beings on this planet together and of course we should be living together, but there is so much horrific cruelty.",
                "I want to flag the issue of housing and the situation whereby we are now seeing mass evictions. Many people are being forced out of their homes and are then having to get rid of their pets because they cannot be taken into emergency accommodation. On top of the trauma of losing their home, families and, in particular, children are going through the trauma of losing their pets because this Government has completely failed to ensure people have a home and to prevent them from being evicted. On top of that, we still have a disgraceful situation whereby most private rental accommodation does not allow people to have pets. Representatives from Dogs Trust say that one of the main reasons people contact them is because they have to move to a rental home where pets are not allowed. They have to go through the heartbreak of surrendering their family pets. As well as explaining to their children that they have to leave their home, they also have to explain why part of the family - the pets - cannot come with them. This month, I was in touch with a woman who was facing the direct trauma of homelessness. She had been trying day and night to find a home for herself but was not able to do so.",

In his opening speech the Minister of State asked us to accept his bona fides about the 12-month delay. I would accept that if this did not happen every single time we put forward legislation. It happened the last time with our Bill to reduce the voting age to sixteen and it happened to our Bill in the Seanad. Time and again, the Government kicks the can down the road and dismisses our ideas.",

One Member from each of those two parties showed up. It was not a comprehensive debate and there was not meaningful engagement with the Government. That is disappointing. These are important issues. We should be progressing this legislation, taking it to Committee Stage, going through the detail and passing it. The response from the Government is disappointing.",

I also thank Dog Law Ireland which worked with her on the Bill. In essence, the Bill would regulate breeding practices and outlaw harmful procedures that cause unnecessary suffering to dogs. At the moment, there are no protections for dogs in breeding establishments. We cannot let dogs throughout the country suffer because successive governments have failed to prioritise animal welfare.",
                "I strongly believe that improving animal welfare should have cross-party support in the House. Dog breeding in this country has been likened to the fast fashion market, with any breed of puppy readily available at the click of a button. Sadly, too many people remain unaware of the ethical concerns associated with this. Our poorly regulated framework has created a multimillion euro industry and resulted in Ireland becoming a huge exporter of puppies to more tightly regulated countries. It has also allowed incredibly harmful practices of surgical artificial insemination to remain legal.",
                "The current lack of regulation has created a system in which dog rescues simply cannot keep up with the pace at which dog breeders are breeding. Nor can they cope with ever-increasing surrender requests or dog abandonment rates. Right now in my city, the Cork Dog Action Welfare group has more than 100 dogs in foster homes and shelters. On the website of the Cork Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals today, one of the first dogs listed for adoption is Ila, who the CSPCA describes as having started life on a puppy farm but is now free from that fate. I commend those organisations and the volunteers who do fantastic work.",

The Government's decision means some of the most vulnerable people will no longer receive tablet blister packs free of charge. We are talking of tens of thousands of older people living with conditions such as dementia and Alzheimer's. They rely on tablet blister packs to help manage their medication. We are also talking about people with disabilities who are under real pressure with the cost of living. The packs help them make sure they take the right dosage at the right time of day. The Government's decision means the cost of dispensing the blister packs - paid for by the State for decades - will now be passed on to these vulnerable customers. They will be hit by fee charges of up to €50 a month in some cases for these packs.",

It is like it cannot stop itself from making life harder for people. It hiked up student fees, the local property tax and the cost of petrol and diesel. It stands back and allows big energy companies to jack up electricity and gas bills and now it hits the most vulnerable elderly people. It is putting huge stress on people during the Christmas period as they know they are going to have to face these charges come 1 January.",

He is in his late 70s and told me his lovely wife suffers from dementia. He said without the blister pack he would find it very hard to manage her medication but he does not know where they are going to find the extra money to pay for them. He says they are literally down to the last euro every couple of weeks as it is.",

Does he really think that matters to people who rely on them? The fact is the government has been paying for these for decades. If there was a mistake in how the packs were being paid for and a correction had to be made, it should have been made to ensure those folks could continue receiving their tablet blister packs as they have been but, no, the Government decided to punish vulnerable people, to ratchet up their costs instead of making sure they are looked after. The truth is the Government had a chance to sort this out. Back in October when it was finalising the new community pharmacy agreement we in Sinn Féin warned it was a big mistake to exclude the blister packs, but the Government chose to ignore that warning, chose to push on and now elderly people and others are paying the price. It is not right, it is not fair and it needs to be stopped.",

On behalf of the man I was talking to, and I am sure many others right across this State, I ask the Taoiseach whether he thinks it is right that people with dementia, Alzheimer's and other conditions who received their blister packs free of charge up until now will have to pay for them on 1 January. Will the Government reverse this terrible decision and ensure vulnerable people can continue getting their blister packs free of charge?"

Tá an tairseach i bhfad níos fearr anois ná mar a bhí sé cúpla bliain ó shin. More generally on the cost of medicine, and particularly charges and so on, this Government has, over the last number of years, significantly reduced the cost of accessing medicine. The DPS threshold in particular has come significantly down, exceeding even commitments made in various manifestoes and so forth. That needs to be acknowledged, as does the abolition of charges in hospitals and so on, so without question right across the board we have reduced costs in the healthcare area. It is without question and the Deputy just cannot get away with saying we are wilfully increasing costs all over the place as he just did. We are not. If you look over the last number of years, costs have come down in terms of State charges in respect of hospitals - acute hospitals, emergency departments - and in respect of medicine and the cost of medicine, particularly the DPS threshold and other bespoke interventions also.",

The ESRI's evaluation of the budget bears that out in that the two lowest deciles gained the most in respect of the budgetary allocation. Also, if you look at real wages and incomes, they are growing at approximately 3% per annum this year and we have targeted measures effectively on the cost-of-living side to support those most in need.",

The Deputy mentioned pharmacies and so on. There is an issue between the HSE and pharmacies in respect of the whole area of phased dispensing, which was introduced as far back as 1996 for patient safety reasons. The supply of medication in instalments can support patients prescribed certain high-risk medications who would be at risk of medication misadventure if these medications were supplied monthly. Where a phased dispensing claim is submitted the current requirement is an item must be dispensed in the pharmacy across multiple supply occasions. Community pharmacies receive additional payments for phased dispensing. Monitored dosing systems, sometimes referred to as blister packs or compliance aids, are systems that enable the individual medicine doses to be organised according to the prescribed dose schedule. The HSE's contention is that monitored dosing systems and phased dispensing are two separate processes and that phased dispensing requires the patient to present to the pharmacy on multiple occasions in the month each week, as it would be unsafe for the patient to have the totality of their medication in one supply occasion. Monitored dosing systems are ordinarily provided in one visit and packaged to indicate when a medication should be taken. The State had never agreed to monitored dosing systems and that was the context-----"

                "Yesterday, we saw the announcement from the Minister, Deputy Norma Foley, that the Government will replace the existing assessment of need process with a new system. However, I have deep concerns about the proposal announced to replace the requirement for a formal diagnosis when determining access to a special class or special school. As a former teacher, I cannot overstate the seriousness of this development. This proposal has profound implications for schools, teachers and the children and families who rely on appropriate, timely and specialist assessment. Replacing diagnostic criteria with an educational assessment places an unreasonable and unsafe burden on schools. To me, it seems that we will streamline the process of receiving therapies, but leave a massive void in how special classes and places will be assigned.",
                "The Minister, Deputy Foley, reiterated yesterday that people will no longer need an assessment of need to get a place in a special school or class, instead saying it is up to education to decide on how these places will be assigned. She outlined that some sort of special educational assessment will be established to get a school place for a child, saying it was her hope that the Department of education would have the new system in place for the September 2027 academic year. Who will carry out this new special educational assessment? Will it be teachers or SENOs? There is no point in the Government suggesting that more psychologists, clinicians or multidisciplinary teams will be required, because the Government has made that money available to hire for these roles, but the roles are not being filled.",
                "I also ask whether the Minister, Deputy Naughton, was aware of these changes yesterday, or was it a surprise to her? It was duly noted that there was no representative from the Department of education at this announcement yesterday. Teachers themselves will say that they are not the ones who should be in the position of determining an appropriate place for a child with additional needs. In reality, this leaves parents in a worse-off position. They will now be chasing two parallel pathways, one to get the therapies they need, and one to get the diagnosis and school place they need.",
                "Does the Taoiseach believe that this makes sense? Yesterday, 85% of the teachers surveyed reported moderate to high work-related burnout. Is the Government now placing this burden on them? Teachers cannot and should not be expected to take on duties that belong to psychologists, clinicians or multidisciplinary teams. This shift undermines the integrity of the entire assessment process and places schools in an impossible position. It also risks leaving families unsupported and pupils at genuine risk of not receiving the appropriate provision that they are entitled to. The proposal seems to be driven not by what is best for children, but by the inability of the health and disability sector to manage the assessment of need backlog.",
                "Who will carry out these educational assessments? How will the Department of education manage and resource this responsibility? Crucially, and I want an answer to this question, has the process of establishing this new special educational assessment begun within the Department of education?"

The assessment of need framework as it currently stands is not fit for purpose, and recent High Court decisions have made it less fit for purpose. The objective of the legislation, along with a whole series of other measures, is to prioritise and increase timely access to therapies for children. That is the fundamental point: to free up therapists in providing services and treatment.",
                "The Department of education was intimately involved with the Department of children and other Departments under the Cabinet subcommittee on disability regarding this legislative change. We made a very clear decision early on in this Government that we were going to do this, and grasp the nettle in respect of it. We can go on here for another two years, with people coming in and complaining about this list and that waiting list, and they will keep on doing that - it is great stuff, wonderful - as the lists keep going up. The system is completely not fit for purpose. We want to utilise therapists to provide services to children, and we are going to do it.",
                "Bottom-line legislation is the first step, but there is a whole series of other measures that we are taking as well. That basically means we are creating statutory guidelines to support assessment officers in making earlier determinations of disability, reducing the need for unnecessary or repeated clinical assessments. There will be proportionate assessments based on each child's circumstances, including the use of existing diagnostic information or reports, allowing for streamlined, desk-based reviews, where appropriate; and faster delivery of assessment reports provided at the earliest possible point, without affecting anyone's right to an assessment of need and without changing the statutory timeframes set out in the Act itself.",
                "We will be doing a wider review of the Disability Act in early 2026 to ensure it reflects modern, rights-based child and adult-focused supports. A dedicated autism diagnostic assessment panel will be established. There will be a new autism assessment and intervention pathways protocol from 5 February 2026, ensuring consistent practice across primary care, CAMHS and CDNTs, and removing the requirement for an assessment of need to access non-health supports, such as special classes and school places. We do not want children waiting to get into a special class or a school place where the need is obvious. We do not want delays. We want to get the child access to facilities and therapies immediately.",
                "There will be 11 new in-reach teams, with four staff in each team, to provide expert clinical guidance to the assessment staff. A new single point of access model from 2026 is being established - Bernard of Gloster and the HSE have led out on this - giving families one consistent entry route to primary care, CAMHS or the children's disability network teams.",

There was no parental controls on the device and he had totally unsupervised access to the Internet. By the age of just six he was viewing pornography for hours every day. This boy ultimately uploaded child abuse images of his sister online, prompting his arrest. Sentencing the boy, Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring likened unchecked Internet access to children playing with matches.",
                "Details of that shocking case were being heard as Australia introduced its social media ban for children under 16. It is a world first and we will all certainly be watching with huge interest to see how it progresses. However, I have a number of concerns about that kind of ban. For a start, most social media companies already have an age limit of 13 and we all know that just its not being enforced. Raising the age limit to 16 will similarly be easy to evade with teenagers creating fake accounts using virtual private networks, VPNs. Crucially, delaying access to social media sites does nothing about the recommender algorithms that are feeding children toxic content. We now have mountains of evidence about the threats posed by these algorithms. One study found teenage boys were being \"bombarded\" with misogynistic content within minutes of signing up to TikTok. Another study found 13-year-old users being shown videos about self harm and suicide within 20 minutes of setting up accounts. Social media platforms now routinely show graphic, violent or racist videos to people who are not looking for that content. This is not just having a hugely damaging impact on children but it is massively corrosive for society. It is spreading misinformation and hate through communities like wildfire.",
                "I will be the first to acknowledge this is a hugely complex issue and there are no easy solutions. In know the Minister is currently looking at age verification for social media users. While I think that is part of the solution, it amounts to putting a sticking plaster on a gaping wound. There are also huge privacy concerns about mandating something like a digital wallet to access services online.",
                "Each of us in this House knows we have to do more to protect children online. We know the current system is failing them. An obvious first step is to regulate the algorithms that boost extremist content to huge audiences online. By default, those systems should be off. Does the Taoiseach agree and will the Government act on this?"

That response spans regulation, education, parental supports, age verification measures, curriculum reforms and school-level policies.",
                "I am aware of that case yesterday and I heard reports in the media in relation to it. It does illustrate the enormous challenge and dangers here. Overall, we have to, through our education system, create a culture of strong self esteem and self respect among children from the earliest of ages. We have had to do this in the past to varying degrees in respect of other issues, be it drug addiction, alcohol addiction and so on. The most fundamental way of assisting society to cope is through very good policies at an early age and programmes from a psychological level which increase the self esteem of children to withstand and be resilient in the face of whatever comes at them in life subsequently. Of course, we can do much more than that.",

We are also developing a secure privacy-focused approach to age verification and we are working to include age verification functionality in Ireland's digital wallet under the EU eIDAS project. That is about giving parents and young people a robust Government-backed mechanism to protect privacy. A large-scale pilot is planned for early next year.",

There is a digital strategy for schools up to 2027. Oide technology in education provides professional learning for teachers and Webwise continues to lead on national awareness training, classroom resources on cyberbullying, image sharing, social media and emerging online risks. We have also acted to reduce mobile phone distraction and support student well-being during school day. We have introduced the full ban on personal phone use in primary schools and strict restrictions at post-primary level. I remember last year when the pouches were introduced, they were ridiculed in here. It was a classic Opposition response."

                "Today I raise the chronic shortage of radiographers and the related fragile state of our diagnostic imaging capacity. As the Taoiseach is probably aware, the HSE has acknowledged that radiology and radiation therapy departments remain under-resourced, with waiting lists for diagnostic scans continuing to grow. We saw earlier this year a report on RTÉ showing that, despite over 200 radiography graduates qualifying annually, many are being forced to emigrate because of appointments not being made. This is not just poor workforce planning; it could be called a misuse of public finds, wasting money training professionals who we then lose abroad while we scramble to import more. The HSE radiology workforce report outlines workforce projections and training requirements and recommends increasing the radiology trainee intake from 39 in 2025 to 75 in 2028, highlighting that Ireland's radiologist numbers per capita are substantially below European norms. This report was prepared to feed into the broader national radiology strategy and while the Minister for Health has confirmed a strategy is being developed and under consideration, we have not yet seen the finer details.",
                "Then, of course, we have our diagnostic imaging capacity problem - a shortage of machines. Where machines go in, that is only half the story.",
                "I want to put a human face on one element of this to explain. A constituent wrote to me. He had just had surgery for prostate cancer this month but twice now his PET scans have been cancelled because the batch of radiation required for the scans failed. This happened because the HSE and the Department of Health rely on a single provider and when that supply chain breaks down, no patient in the country can get their scan. This is not an isolated incident. The European Medicines Agency has warned that radiopharmaceutical supply chains across the EU are fragile, with occasional shortages already reported in other member states. The OECD confirms that Europe's reliance on a small number of reactors and suppliers for specific isotopes creates a systemic risk. In Ireland, we are directly exposed to these vulnerabilities and we have no contingency plan.",
                "Imagine the stress. The scans people have these conditions are not optional. It is the way of knowing whether or not the cancer has spread beyond the prostate. It determines the course of treatment and cancelling it not once but twice leaves the patient in limbo facing surgery without the full picture. The person who wrote to me said, \"I am one of God knows how many people experiencing this stress, yet it is never heard about. The teams I have been dealing with are phenomenal but they are also been put under huge pressure\"’. It is not only related to systemic failure in terms of prostate cancer. It also relates to other areas, such as breast cancer, for example, because PET scans used for staging in treatment and planning in breast cancer require radiopharmaceuticals, such as fluorodeoxyglucose, FDG, as well, which are isotope dependent. This needs to be addressed."

Capital funding of over €140 million has been used since that date - one is current and the other is capital - to provide state-of-the-art radiation oncology facilities in Cork and Galway and to establish a national cervical screening laboratory, and then to update cancer infrastructure and chemotherapy wards and lab facilities.",

New radiology posts will enhance the specialist care of many specialties, including cancer care. Budget 2025 included funding for five additional training specialist registrar posts along with four additional training posts.",

We have five public radiotherapy treatment departments in Ireland, with a total of 22 linear accelerators in operation across these services. Galway has four machines. Cork has five machines. St. Luke's Radiation Oncology Network has 14 machines operating across three sites in Dublin: St. James's, Beaumont and St. Luke's. The HSE has a planned radiotherapy equipment replacement programme in place and has advised that all linear accelerator, Linac, machines in the St. Luke's Radiation Oncology Network will be replaced over a five-year period out to 2030 with an additional two machines to be located at the Beaumont site. The design process is currently under way. Step 1 of the procurement process for the works and equipment will commence in Q1 of next year, with a contractor in place later in the year. If we can accelerate that, we will. The replacement programme has come under the national development plan. It is being progressed under its aegis. It is included in the capital plan for 2025 and the health sectoral capital plan from 2026-2030. The facilities in Cork and Galway are newly-built facilities, opened in 2019 and 2023, respectively, involving capital investment of €120 million. Advanced radiotherapy technology in Ireland has also been implemented, including the stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy and the stereotactic radiosurgery, SRS, which aims to reduce the number of treatment sessions.",

It is about putting the staff in place with secure long-term jobs and about making sure we have a plan B for when we are missing the isotope provision. We need a second supplier."

Then there is an important service level agreement between the HSE and Health and Social Care Northern Ireland to provide radiotherapy on a cross-Border basis at the North West Cancer Centre, which I visited in Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry. That initiative offers cancer patients within a 90 minutes road journey of the city of Derry access to radiotherapy in Altnagelvin and this provides important access in the north west to patients who would otherwise face long travel distances. We are utilising private capacity and Northern capacity, which we have invested in as part of the North-South co-operation. We are trying to build up the capacity on all fronts."

It is growing in importance in terms of the European Union. It can be quite helpful to look at directives again and areas that impede the building of houses and infrastructure. The Deputy is very prescient in identifying housing as a Europe-wide issue. We can get added value from how Europe approaches new directives or, indeed, existing directives that inadvertently impede the acceleration of housing development. Last week, I met President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. There is no question that security and defence issues are very serious issues for Europe now. We witnessed that with the emergence of drones off our coast last week, but that is part of a pattern. As the President said himself at the press conference yesterday, it is the new norm. In Copenhagen, there was the emergence of drones during the European political council, and in France and Belgium. There has been a pattern of behaviour in the Baltic Sea, which is quite worrying, and also in Poland in terms of the train track there. There are serious issues facing security. Our vulnerabilities are without question in subsea cables, critical undersea infrastructure and gas connectors. We need to be very clear. I see that as an emergency from a security perspective. That is why we are developing the State-backed strategic gas emergency reserve. This is a security imperative. People have criticised it in the context of climate and other issues. The Irish economy needs backup in energy resilience. This is a crucial project. It is an ongoing issue."

We know that wholesale electricity costs have collapsed but Irish households still pay among the highest bills in Europe. The ESRI has confirmed what we already knew - electricity prices doubled between 2018 and 2024. It says that there is no clear explanation for what suppliers are charging. There is no explanation because they are engaged in price gouging and ripping people off. What is the Taoiseach going to do to deal with this? Does he support what the ESRI has been calling for and a possible Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, inquiry into this practice? People do not need soundbites any more from the Taoiseach. They need a Government that is willing to act, stand up to energy companies, end the rip-off, get prices under control and make life more affordable."

I pay tribute to the members of the scheme, the CIÉ Salaried Pensioners' Association and the trade union group for their tireless advocacy on the matter. To be fair, the Government has finally sorted it, but now there is growing frustration among the 2,305 members of the scheme that the increase agreed back in May still has not been received. My colleague, Duncan Smith, was in the Chamber last week talking about An Post pensioners who were going through similar issues. I understand a statutory instrument is required, which can only be signed by the Minister for Transport following approval of a business case by three separate Departments, the Office of the Attorney General and NewERA financial advisers. We understand that a bit of work needs to be done on the Government's side, but it is seven months later and I understand the statutory instrument still has not been finalised.

They have been receiving their basic pay in recognition of the fact that they contracted Covid at the peak of the pandemic in high-risk settings such as hospital wards and have paid an enormous price in the form of ongoing long Covid symptoms, including debilitating post-exertional malaise. While we will be looking forward to rest and leisure over the Christmas period, these healthcare workers face the loss of their financial security, not being able to pay their mortgages after using up their standard sick leave, and ultimately having to retire prematurely on medical grounds. A group of these workers met the Taoiseach in Cork in June and felt he gave them a lot of time, showed genuine empathy and concern for their situation and, crucially, validated the seriousness of their symptoms and the fact that they had contracted Covid in the workplace. However, Ireland, with Greece, remains an outlier in Europe in not recognising long Covid as an occupational injury for the cohort in question. Can we extend the pay arrangement for six months while occupational injury status is properly explored?"

On top of that, we are developing a different assessment of need process, which the legislation published yesterday was designed to streamline but also to free up therapists to provide services as opposed to being locked up in an assessment process.

They are ending up having to pay significant development contributions to local authorities, on average well in excess of €5,000. The development levy waiver introduced by the previous Government was a super initiative. It helped to bolster housing supply and ensure a big pipeline of housing deliver. We saw some of the largest commencement numbers ever last year, with more than 60,000 homes commenced, about 10% of which were first-time, one-off homes. People in rural areas do not feel like it is a fair charge because if they are building in a rural area, they do not get public lights or footpaths and the money that is paid is not specifically ring-fenced for a particular area. I am asking the Taoiseach, given that we are in a housing crisis, to consider the reintroduction of the development levy waiver for one-off homes in rural areas. This will facilitate young people who are starting out their journey of home ownership and trying to self-build. They could do it without the extra burden of costs."

My concern is that the shelving of this project will have a knock-on effect on providing additional public transport, which we all support, on the Waterford-Heuston line, and to other towns in south Kildare, like Athy and Monasterevin, and, as a knock-on effect of that, to towns like Portlaoise and Carlow. Can the Taoiseach confirm that the delay in DART+ South West will not have a knock-on effect on the provision of additional carriages on those lines because so many people are commuting and stuck in that traffic? I would appreciate if the Taoiseach could confirm that there will be no delay in providing additional carriages on those lines."

It was SPS checks that revealed the unacceptable discoveries in terms of hormone-infected beef across Europe. It is a significant issue in terms of the different standards, approaches and so forth.

Unfortunately, because we have chosen not to reimburse it, a public patient cannot.

Many are afraid to heat their own homes, and they were very clear: people with disabilities are having to choose between heating and eating. That is what they said themselves. One of the protesters said that the budget was a disaster for families with disabilities. Another asked why they have to spend their lives fighting for the basics. Why do disabled people, their carers and often their families have to protest outside Leinster House? We are facing into a difficult winter, as the Taoiseach is well aware.

There were related investments in health and education. We are committed to introducing a permanent annual cost-of-disability support payment. The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Calleary, is leading the strategic focus network on the cost of disability. That is a key commitment under the strategy that I referenced earlier. That will shape our approach to delivering that payment and several meetings have already taken place. We want to put permanent supports in place.

It is unbelievable. In most of those cases, their income is too low for them to be able to avail of cost rental because it has to be less than 35% of their income. There is a whole group of people earning between about €40,000 and €50,000 per year who are entitled to no housing support at all. They are knocked off the list because they get working family payment, a little pay rise or whatever, but their income is too low to pay the rents for cost rental, leaving them nowhere.

                "As the House knows, the level of homelessness has reached an historical high. In October, there were 16,766 people, including 5,274 children, in Department of housing-funded emergency accommodation. Of course, that is not the true level of homelessness. When we include rough sleepers, women and children in Tusla-funded domestic violence refuges and all those people with status or leave to remain trapped in IPAS accommodation essentially using it as emergency accommodation, the real number of homeless people in the State is over 22,000. That is before we even start to talk about people who are sofa-surfing or living in inadequate and inappropriate accommodation.",
                "At the same time as having these unacceptably high levels of homelessness, we also now have increasing levels of eviction notices. The most recent data from the Residential Tenancies Board indicates that from July to September of this year, 5,405 eviction notices were issued by landlords. That figure is up 35% on the same period last year and up 14% on the second quarter of this year.",
                "At the same time, contrary to what the Taoiseach has just told us, the volume of social housing that is being delivered is about half in real terms what it was in the 1970s when population and housing demand are taken into account. It is way below the Government's own targets, which are too low in the first place. At the same time as having inadequate provision of social housing, we see rents and eviction notices continuing to rise. What that tells any of us who are willing to look at the data is that over the next number of months, the number of families, single people, children and pensioners at risk of homelessness and, ultimately, entering into emergency accommodation will rise. That is totally unacceptable and nobody in this House should allow month-on-month rises in homelessness to be normalised.",
                "The big worry many of us now have is our local authorities and emergency accommodation providers are at near capacity. Very shortly, we will be back to the bad old days when Eoghan Murphy was Minister where families with children who are unable to access emergency accommodation will be referred to Garda stations, which, again, is utterly unacceptable.",
                "What do we need? We need an emergency response from Government so today I am introducing a ban on winter evictions Bill, which is one of a number of key emergency measures that must be introduced now to address this crisis. The legislation, if enacted in December, would ensure no-fault evictions could not take place until 1 July next year. That would not only reduce the number of people entering homelessness and address the capacity challenges but, crucially and most importantly, it would give the Government some breathing space during which it could introduce the other emergency measures that I and many homeless policy advocates have been urging the Government to do for many years.",
                "The first is, of course, to dramatically increase funding for local authorities for the tenant in situ scheme. That funding was dramatically cut this year by Government. It is a scheme that provides a vital homeless prevention support where landlords want to sell the property to the local authority and the social housing applicant wants to remain in what is effectively their home. We also need Government to go much further. We need the use of emergency planning and procurement powers combined with new building technologies to bring on stream a dedicated supply of additional social homes, specifically for people who are in emergency accommodation, prioritising in the first instance the growing number of pensioners in emergency accommodation and families with children. The full detail of that outlined was outlined in the Sinn Féin alternative housing plan last year.",
                "We also need to see a doubling of the number of new housing first tenancies for those single people who are trapped long term in emergency accommodation. More generally, we need a dramatic increase in targets for and delivery of social and affordable homes, including the right kinds of homes for people who are trapped long term in emergency accommodation. That is more one-bed and more four-beds and lager five-beds homes. Not only do we need to increase the number of those homes but, in turn, increase the dedicated allocation for those trapped in emergency accommodation.",
                "The Government never stops telling us that tackling the housing and homeless crisis is its number one priority, yet in the housing plan that was published only a few weeks ago, there was not a single new additional measure to prevent homelessness or to accelerate the exit of single people, families and children from emergency accommodation. A winter ban on evictions - a six month breathing space - is crucial. It is not the only action but one of a number of actions we have consistently proposed.",
                "Not only am I introducing this Bill today on First Stage but Sinn Féin will progress it through Private Members' time as a matter of urgency. Then we will be able to see whether the Government is serious about tackling homelessness or whether it is just more crocodile tears."

There is necessarily a focus on the State’s internal security, including the evolving challenges we face from terrorism and extremism and from cyber threats, and a focus on the need to increase our investment in security and to modernise our legislation in the security field, notably in the investigatory powers available to our services. It will include also the implications of recent security, defence and international developments and their related impacts, notably the deteriorating security situation in Europe given Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine and the growth in cyber and hybrid threats in Europe. It will combine an enhanced maritime domain awareness with a prioritised focus on ensuring protection of critical maritime infrastructure, especially critical undersea infrastructure.

More importantly, as the populations continue to grow in these towns, we need gardaí that become community gardaí, that the people know and connect with and can build relationships with into the future.

The consequence is there are now eight protesters on hunger strike for over 30 days. This is the longest, most significant hunger strike since the H-block hunger strikers. Their demands are minimal, namely, the right to a fair trial, the right to access bail, the right to access medical care in prison and for the ending of the proscription of Palestine Action. There is an almost total media blackout on this in Britain, leading people to suspect there is a so-called D-notice in relation to this.

It reflects a growing awareness and engagement with this House, not before time, in respect of security and defence issues. There has been a wilful ignoring of these issues for far too long in the House. Particular perspectives have been taken on this. Even this morning, there were references to the United Kingdom, Europe or America as being threats. The clear threats right now in this era include a Russian threat to our security and security infrastructure. We have had engagement between Iran and Russia and North Korea and Russia. North Korean soldiers have been on European soil during a period of war, seeking to violate the territorial integrity of Ukraine and its sovereignty. These are the realities we face. We wish we were not facing these realities and we would prefer a Continent at peace and so on.",
                    "The strategy will be completed. Deputy Brabazon was the first to speak and referred to self-reliance. We will develop radar capacity, and that is very close to action in terms of procurement – a lot of work has gone into that. We need to co-operate and co-ordinate with other member states in the European Union and the United Kingdom in respect of all of these issues because a pattern has developed in terms of the emergence of these drones and the violation of the airspace of EU member states. The most notable incident occurred in Copenhagen at the time of the European Political Community meeting. Denmark sought help and advice from other EU member states at that time. There were incidents in Belgium, France, Poland, in terms of train tracks and so on, and in the Baltic Sea. We are agreed that, on the drone issue, disabling technology is important.",
                    "The visit of President Zelenskyy was very effective from a security perspective. I want to make it clear to everybody that an incident did occur on that night. A small number of unidentified drones were observed in the vicinity of a Naval Service vessel on patrol off the coast of Dublin. The drones were not a threat to President Zelenskyy's aircraft - that needs to be clear - because it had safely landed quite some time prior to the incident, nor were they a threat to his departure. An operational response was put in place that was appropriate to the circumstances by the commander of the naval vessel at the time and, subsequently, by the police and military authorities working in close co-operation. They worked closely together in advance of the visit and so on.",
                    "The Garda liaised with its Ukrainian partners throughout the visit of the President on the security arrangements, including with regard to this incident. The Garda special detective unit is carrying out an investigation of the circumstances of the incident with input from the Defence Forces. It is a very concerning incident, as I said, like other similar incidents in other European states. The circumstances are suggestive of this being part of an ongoing Russian-inspired hybrid campaign against European Union and Ukrainian interests."

                    "Deputy Lawless raised the issue of cybersecurity. Cyber threats and attacks have increased significantly since the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Some have been by criminal elements, some have been by professionals. There are also third party state actors in respect of cybersecurity threats. It is a very serious issue for both public utilities and private sector companies. It is costing a lot of funding to deal with that. We have brought the National Cyber Security Centre under the Department of justice. It is a very strong centre and has grown in capacity very significantly in the past five years. I remember when we started it. It has developed a really strong capacity under Richard Browne. Credit needs to be given in respect of that.",
                    "I make the point to Deputy Ó Murchú that there is not a failure in funding, frankly, and finance will not be an issue here. What is an issue is the procurement timelines, both within the European defence industry and more generally. We are working to see if we can accelerate procurement. We are doing that with the radar. That is why we took a joint country approach to procurement - to fast track it. In other words, we use the experience and expertise of countries that have experience of procuring the radar we are now seeking. Everyone will be about how fast we can procure. It will also be about taking an intelligent approach in terms of what we procure. The nature of modern warfare or security threats has changed radically. We are all witnessing the drone technology change, as well as the cybersecurity. What can we do undersea? How do we protect cables? How do we protect gas connectors? It is a whole-of-society security approach that is required here. It is not the traditional, conventional approach to defence and security. We need to consider and explore that point more, perhaps.",
                    "On the Dublin-Monaghan bombing, Deputy Boyd-Barrett is correct insofar as the summary of the Denton report was produced yesterday. It is regrettable that we do not have the full Denton report. I think there was some legal action taken to try to prevent it being published in full. The Kenova report has been published. We should have a debate on the Kenova report in this House in the new year. It reveals very sordid activity by state actors but also by paramilitaries, including the Provisional IRA. The Kenova report does not pull its punches in saying it was a threat to its own community or attacked its own community. What went on is quite unbelievable.",
                    "The Denton report stated that 120 people were murdered by a network of loyalist paramilitaries and RUC and UDR personnel, including those killed in the Dublin-Monaghan bombings. It is a very sordid story and both the Kenova and Denton reports cover it. I pay tribute to Jon Boutcher, who is now the head of the PSNI, for his leadership on Kenova, and also to Iain Livingstone. They withstood a lot of pressure. We will have two comprehensive reports, if we can get the latter one published."

The Cabinet committee works to drive infrastructure delivery and the implementation of the revised national development plan. As Members know, last week, we brought to Government the essence of that plan. The reform of the delivery of critical, growth-enhancing infrastructure is a key commitment in the programme for Government. Last week marked a major milestone on this agenda with the publication of the accelerating infrastructure report and action plan.",
                    "This plan sets out 30 high-impact and time-bound reforms to speed and scale up delivery of homes, roads, public transport, wastewater plants and energy infrastructure. Actions include legislative reforms to balance individual rights and public good, simplify regulation and consenting systems, cut administrative burden and red tape and build public acceptance and a delivery culture. The reforms align with broader housing, climate and competitiveness goals. These will be achieved by streamlining approvals to allow concurrent processing, introducing statutory timelines for major project decisions, rationalising delivery guidance to reduce duplication and complexity, enhancing procurement practices through clearer project pipelines, and fostering a delivery-focused culture that balances safeguards with urgency.",
                    "We are at a critical juncture. We have a strong economy and growing population, but our infrastructure delivery is too slow. We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to transform this. The Government, private sector and communities must align behind delivery. The plan is underscored by the largest capital investment in the history of the State, with over €275 billion planned over the coming ten years.",
                    "Over recent weeks, Departments have published their ambitious sectoral investment plans for the next five years. Areas such as energy, transport and water will see a significant scale-up in funding and delivery, all of which will support us to address our infrastructure deficit and scale up housing. There will also be robust oversight of the Government’s performance in achieving these actions with regular reports on progress to the Cabinet committee on infrastructure. In the period ahead, the Cabinet committee will, therefore, oversee both the investments and reforms required to ensure that infrastructure is delivered as efficiently and quickly as possible."

The next phase of that road is the piece between Macroom and Ballincollig.

Hopefully, with this national development plan and the allocation of ten years, we will avoid this stop-start where we get a project from A to B but C is not provided for at all. We had that over the last two decades, I suppose. I recall how the Cork-Limerick road had planning in an earlier era and then that was all shelved after the financial crash and so on. If they had kept the planning going, they would have been in a much better position now to actually start. I do accept that, and particularly on the N22. The Macroom bypass has been extremely effective but there is the problem that you go along a great road into Ballincollig if you are coming from the Kerry side but then you are suddenly into what, as the Deputy was saying to me the other day, is like a parking lot for the next 20 to 40 minutes. It is a very good point that we should encourage Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and others to keep thinking of the next stage and to have the planning ready and preparatory work done. I will work on that particular stretch the Deputy has referenced.",

Some of that is due to stakeholder engagement and public engagement, and there can be objections and so on. If any projects are of such imperative, these are. We do know that when these projects happen, they are effective in protecting against flooding. Towns that had historical flooding events have stopped them because of good infrastructure being put in. These projects invite a lot of objections. We had it in Cork city and it went the whole way to the top courts. It is only now that work is under way and all of that. There was flooding in Cork city this week. It was there because of the tidal levels, but one could argue that if you had the protections in, then businesses and people would have been protected and people could have gone in and out of town. I am very conscious of that.",
                    "With regard to Deputy Dolan's question, I will come back to the Minister. It was a good point. I do no know where we are on it in terms of the national development plan but there is no question that Galway city is facing enormous congestion, including all the areas feeding into Galway city. It is a real problem. Public transport, including rail, does give us an option, but not the whole option. We have to get the ring road done. Equally, though, the rail infrastructure is critical. I will talk to the Minister for Transport, Darragh O'Brien, about that.",
                    "Deputy O'Rourke raised the issue of the updated wind farm guidelines. The Deputy is correct that they have been a long time coming and technology has changed in the intervening period. I have asked the Minister, James Browne, to accelerate the work on the guidelines. The unit in his Department is also working on planning exemptions. There is a lot of work there. The Department is also working on rural guidelines for housing and one-off housing. There is a lot of work in that Department but I accept that we do need to bring this to a conclusion. At some stage, we need some collective debate on energy. We are all dealing with individual cases of objections to solar, objections to gas generation, objections to wind onshore, and objections to wind offshore potentially. We desperately need the offshore wind. This is something we have got to progress through planning. I am hoping we can get wind farms built, certainly through 2030 to 2031. If we do not, then we are in trouble from an energy perspective. As a collective - when I say \"collective\", I mean the entire Oireachtas - we have to try to stand back and say that there are huge challenges. We discussed security earlier. We are very dependent on the importation of fossil fuels through the interconnectors. There are real issues here that we need to be clear-eyed about. We can then take decisions once everybody realises that there are pluses and minuses in all of this.",

There have been issues for habitual users of bus services who feel the changing of services or the reorientation of scheduling and so on has eroded what they would have had prior to it. Then we had all the issues around what were, in my view, over-the-top initial plans, which then got rolled back. This seems to have been a pattern throughout the BusConnects journey and I think lessons could be learned from that. A lot of heat built up that perhaps was not necessary in the first place because a lot of stuff that was proposed was then taken away. We will engage with the National Transport Authority, NTA, in terms of what is happening. It has made a lot of progress now on BusConnects. We need a good bus transport system.",

                "Táim sásta a bheith anseo chun an cheist thar a bheith tábhachtach seo a phlé. Mar Aire Cultúir, Cumarsáide agus Spóirt, is í an tsábháilteacht ar líne, go háirithe do leanaí agus daoine óga, an chloch is mó ar mo phaidrín. Dála go leor eile sa Teach seo, is tuismitheoir mé mar aon le polaiteoir. Mar sin, tá sábháilteacht ar líne tábhachtach domsa mar athair.",
                "I am pleased to be here this afternoon to discuss this very important issue. As Minister for Culture, Communications and Sport, online safety, in particular for children and young people, is a top priority for me. However, like many others in the House, I am a parent as well as a politician, so online safety is even important to me as a father.",
                "Like so many other important public policy issues that we discuss in this House, online safety is a complex issue. If we take a step back and think of the technological advances we have made in the past 20 years, we can see how the Internet and digitalisation have helped to improve our lives. We can avail of a range of Government services online in a convenient and secure fashion. Instead of having to take a day off work to renew a passport, we can do it online from the comfort of our homes.",
                "We can apply online for social welfare entitlements and get a response very quickly.",
                "As part of that technological leap forward, the advent of social media means, on the positive side, that we are connected as a community and as a nation as never before. We can both teach others and learn from them in ways that were unfathomable for previous generations. However, there are also risks and we need to constantly bear in mind the need for online safety, particularly when it comes to our children.",
                "As many Members of the House of a certain age might be able to say, we are digital immigrants. On the other hand, our children are digital natives. Social media, with everything it brings, is part of their lives. So, it is essential that we make sure that children do not see illegal, harmful or age-inappropriate content while being able to safely avail of all the benefits of the online world.",
                "The regulation of online platforms has undergone a transformation in recent years as a result of groundbreaking legislation, notably the Online Safety and Media Regulation Act 2022 - the OSMR Act - which underpinned the establishment of Coimisiún na Meán and provided the legislative basis for the online safety code. In addition to an coimisiún’s role as media regulator, it now implements a range of online safety legislation from across the Government. This new online safety framework consists of three main elements: the aforementioned OSMR Act, which transposed the audiovisual media services directive; the EU Digital Services Act, DSA, under which an coimisiún is Ireland’s digital services co-ordinator, and the EU terrorist content online regulation, for which Coimisiún na Meán is also a competent authority on supervision and enforcement. This framework equips an coimisiún with the tools required to regulate online services, to supervise compliance and to enforce it as necessary, including by way of financial sanctions, should they be required.",
                "At this juncture, it is important to state that the Government provided for Coimisiún na Meán to be largely self-sufficient in terms of resourcing. An coimisiún levies the entities it regulates and the income from these levies enables it to deliver on its strategic objectives. However, from the beginning, the Government came forward with resources to enable an coimisiún to hit the ground running, providing more than €10 million for the purpose from the outset. That enabled an coimisiún to kickstart recruitment. From a starting point of 40 staff, it now has over 260. I have secured sanction for it to recruit over 300 staff and I will work to ensure that its staffing level continues to grow as additional functions are assigned to it. This puts Coimisiún na Meán in the big league when it comes to resources and staffing and the levy provision enables it to keep pace with developments.",
                "In terms of significant developments in the framework, it is important to acknowledge the full application in July of this year of Ireland’s online safety code. To allow for the implementation of the code, it was rolled out in two parts. Part A, which has general obligations, has applied since November 2024. Under Part A, designated platforms must provide for protections for minors from content that may impair physical, mental or moral development, and for the general public from content that incites hatred or violence or is racist or xenophobic.",
                "The second part - Part B - has applied since July 2025 and has more specific obligations, such as prohibiting the uploading or sharing of harmful content on their services, including cyberbullying, promoting self-harm or suicide, and promoting eating or feeding disorders, as well as incitement to hatred or violence, terrorism, child sex abuse material, racism and xenophobia. Part B requires the use of age assurance to prevent children from encountering pornography or gratuitous violence online and the provision of parental controls for content that may impair the physical, mental, or moral development of children under the age of 16.",
                "It is for the regulated platforms to demonstrate that they have the correct safety measures in place to prevent illegal or harmful content being shown. The code also makes it clear that it is up to the designated services to ensure that the age assurance methods they are using are robust and privacy protecting. Self-declaration of age is no longer an acceptable form of age verification. A failure to address these requirements adequately can lead to significant financial sanctions and continued non-compliance can lead to criminal sanctions for senior management. Coimisiún na Meán is responsible for enforcing compliance with the code and fines for non-compliance can reach up to €20 million or 10% of annual turnover, whichever is the higher.",
                "I would note that the online safety code has been and is being challenged in the courts, but it is being successfully defended by Coimisiún na Meán. This is a tribute to the good work of the commission in developing the code but also shows that certain platforms are vigorous in seeking to test its integrity.",
                "The DSA has applied since February 2024. It is a harmonised EU-wide law that establishes a framework for regulating illegal content. Under the DSA, the European Commission is the primary regulator for the very large online platforms, such as X, Facebook, YouTube and Instagram, and the very large search engines such as Google. The European Commission operates with the assistance of a digital services co-ordinator in each member state. In Ireland, that is Coimisiún na Meán.",
                "As provided for in the DSA, once they are made aware of illegal content on their platforms, platforms must act to remove it or be held responsible. More generally, the framework obliges them to take steps to minimise the availability of harmful, inappropriate or illegal content, especially if it could be encountered by children.",
                "In terms of progress on implementing the DSA, Coimisiún na Meán announced last month that it was investigating the platform X for possible non-compliance with the DSA in respect of how it deals with complaints. Last week, it announced two further investigations - of LinkedIn and TikTok - in relation to how they deal with complaints. Last week, the European Commission fined X a total of €120 million for failure to fulfil certain transparency obligations under the DSA. I would add that I understand the European Commission investigated TikTok for similar suspected breaches and that that investigation concluded with TikTok making necessary changes and the European Commission standing down its investigation. This demonstrates the commitment of the regulators, nationally and at EU level, to supervising and enforcing online safety frameworks but more importantly, getting results in terms of the changes that improve safety.",
                "In July, the European Commission published guidelines on protection of minors under Article 28 of the DSA. These guidelines outline recommendations to strengthen online safety for children in EU member states. In particular, the guidelines set out a non-exhaustive list of proportionate and appropriate measures to protect children from online risks such as harmful content, problematic and addictive behaviours, cyberbullying and harmful commercial practices. Among other things, the guidelines recommend the use of effective age assurance methods to restrict access to adult-only content.",
                "In terms of encountering content, we know that algorithms and recommender systems can have harmful impacts on users, especially children. From a regulatory perspective, these issues are addressed in the DSA. In that regard, the European Commission is currently investigating TikTok and Meta related in part to their recommender systems and the impact of those on children and young people.",
                "Members will be aware of serious issues with people, including our elected representatives, being on the receiving end of appalling abuse and intimidatory behaviour. It is essential that people report such incidents to platforms in the first instance but then to Coimisiún na Meán if they do not receive a satisfactory response on appeal. If anyone feels unsafe, they should also report it to An Garda Síochána. We have seen in recent times how the Garda has brought perpetrators of such abuse to justice. However, it is clear that there is an onus on the platforms to comply with regulatory obligations and to minimise the availability of this harmful content.",
                "I know that the Oireachtas established its task force on safe participation in political life and that Coimisiún na Meán participated in the work. The commission published research earlier this year outlining the experiences of election candidates in the local elections of 2024. The report set out a number of commitments that the commission undertook to fulfil in order to help to make life online safer for election candidates and politicians.",
                "The report correctly identifies a degree of fatalism among people about the value of reporting harmful online content, but I still encourage everybody to report inappropriate, harmful or illegal content to the relevant platform and then to Coimisiún na Meán if the response is unsatisfactory. The commission would say that having a deeper evidence base, including from information gleaned from complaints, gives it the grounds to take action against platforms suspected of not fulfilling their obligations. The investigations announced by the commission recently, which focus on how platforms deal with complaints, illustrates clearly how seriously it takes its responsibilities.",
                "Obviously, awareness is critical here and the commission is taking action with a two-pronged awareness campaign now running across a range of platforms, aimed at children on the one hand and parents on the other. In 2024, Coimisiún na Meán ran the \"Spot it, Flag it, Stop it\" campaign to help people understand what constitutes illegal content online and provide guidance about how to report it. Coimisiún na Meán also developed educational resources for post-primary schools that advised students, parents and teachers of their rights under the online safety framework. These educational resources were produced with the support of the Irish Internet Safety Awareness Centre, better known as Webwise, and include both junior and senior cycle lesson plans, teacher guides and downloadable posters and infographics. The resources were shared with every post-primary school in the country. Recently, Coimisiún na Meán supported and part-funded the development of Webwise’s new switched on digital citizenship education programme for fifth and sixth classes.",
                "Additionally, in July of this year the commission launched a nationwide advertising campaign in cinemas focused on the rights of users online and the continued importance of reporting illegal or harmful content to online platforms, in both Irish and English. The cinema campaign has reached more than 1.4 million cinema-goers. Coimisiún na Meán has now launched a further significant awareness campaign, with the support of the Department of Health. It is in two parts, the first of which is for young people and is focused on individual rights and the online safety framework. It is running across social media and digital platforms and will help young people understand why reporting is important through a series of humorous videos. The second element is a campaign for parents, which is running across radio, social and digital. This campaign will help parents identify the types of harmful content that can be reported and will highlight the importance of reporting in order to help hold platforms to account. These will be supported by extensive new website resources, including guides on how to report and the parents' information pack.",
                "This demonstrates the cross-cutting nature of online safety. The Department of Education and Youth is supporting online safety in schools through curriculum supports, digital citizenship initiatives and the provision of funding for mobile phone storage solutions. The Department of Health will publish tomorrow the final report of the online health task force which sets out a range of recommendations to improve online safety from a public health perspective. I welcome the work undertaken by both Departments and will continue to work with them and across Government to ensure we progress online safety for the benefit of all.",
                "On children’s online safety, I cannot overstate how important I think age verification is. It is quite clear robust age verification is a basic requirement. It is a vital part of the picture in terms of providing proof that children are the age they claim to be and to ensure they are not exposed to harmful or illegal content. I am working across Government and with all the stakeholders to ensure children and young people can be safe from harmful or illegal content online, in particular through a new Government measure to support age verification. I am seeking the inclusion of a commitment to this effect in the Government’s updated national digital strategy, which will be published shortly. In addressing age verification we must seek to ensure there are trustworthy systems in place that are interoperable and respect users' rights, including data protection rights. To that end, officials in the Department are continuing to work with the Government's Chief Information Officer and their office to look at more practical technical solutions to age verification using MyGovID as part of the Government's digital wallet. The online safety code requires platforms to have robust age verification in place to protect children from content that is inappropriate for them, such as pornography, and there is no doubt the provision of a Government-backed, robust, zero-knowledge, privacy-securing option is an important step forward and one I hope will have the support of all parties in the House. The aim is to commence an extensive pilot to test the technology, starting in quarter 1 of next year and we will be looking for volunteers from the public to assist with this. I will also be writing to platforms in the coming weeks to invite them to participate in the pilot and I expect those that are committed to online safety will be happy to engage. I will also be inviting them to a stakeholder consultation after Christmas.",
                "Notwithstanding the work we are doing on age verification, parents and families have a role to play by ensuring they have the necessary conversations with their children about their lives online. It is important parents feel empowered to address these questions together and there are a wide range of resources online, including from the Department of education, but also from other parts of civil society organisations in the sector, which are designed to help parents and families support children to get the best out of their online experiences. In that context, Members will no doubt be aware European Union member states are examining the question of prohibiting access by children and young people to social media platforms; the so-called \"digital age of majority\". Australia is implementing such a measure and other jurisdictions are considering similar measures. In Australia, from today age-restricted social media platforms will have to take reasonable steps to prevent Australians under the age of 16 from creating or keeping an account. The platforms that are now age-restricted are Facebook, Instagram, Kick, Reddit, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, Twitch, X and YouTube. Alongside this, just last week Coimisiún na Meán signed a memorandum of understanding with the Australian eSafety Commissioner. The objective of the collaboration is to increase expertise in the area of digital regulation and online safety through exchange of information, data, good practices, methodologies and information about technical systems and tools. I should add I met representatives of the Australian Government on this matter recently.",
                "Ireland is considering its approach to the digital age of majority. Any decision would be better taken by the EU and its member states together. In that regard it is important to note the President of the European Commission Ursula van der Leyen announced she would establish an expert panel to examine the issue, including the implementation of Australia’s social media age-restriction policy and advise her on the best approach for Europe in taking next steps on social media regulation in a report by the end of the year. I recognise that there are currently different perspectives across the European Union as to whether there should be an age of digital majority, and if there were such an age, what age it should be and whether it should be an outright ban or an age restriction unless there is parental consent. In considering this, it is important we include the voice of our young people and have regard to their rights while protecting them from harm. It is also important any such measures comply with the DSA as it is an EU regulation that requires maximum harmonisation for all EU member states, including Ireland.",
                "Online safety, particularly for children and young people, will be a priority for me during Ireland’s Presidency of the European Union. Ireland will bring forward Council conclusions on online safety for negotiation and agreement by the member states. Ireland will hold a high-level conference on online safety in Dublin in September 2026, the outcome of which will feed into the work of the Presidency. In addition, a youth forum will be convened in advance of the Presidency to engage directly with children and young people in relation to online safety, including in respect of measures such as age verification and a digital age of majority. In the run-up to the Presidency, there is an opportunity for Ireland to demonstrate leadership and build alliances with like-minded EU member states in relation to strengthening online safety for our minors. Coimisiún na Meán has also sought to develop relationships with its EU counterparts, not least as vice-chair of the working group that drew up the guidance for platforms on implementing Article 28 of the DSA on the protection of minors. As I have outlined, significant progress has been made through legislation and regulation and considerations are being given to the next steps but it is also important we educate, and raise awareness among, the general public of Ireland's online safety framework, the obligations of platforms, the rights of users and the role of Coimisiún na Meán.",
                "More generally, in April 2025, the Government approved the publication of a new national counter disinformation strategy. As we all know, disinformation is a serious challenge and one which must be met with a whole-of-society response. The problem is not new. We have seen the corrosive effects of propaganda and false narratives over the centuries. What is new is how easily the mistruths can be produced, how sophisticated and convincing they are and how they can be amplified and circulated at astonishing speed. The problem has, however, been turbocharged by technology. The rate at which technology is evolving means the problem of disinformation is dynamic and we must strive to match this dynamism with steps to counter it. Our efforts to tackle this problem must not and cannot come at the expense of our right to freedom of expression, which is enshrined in Bunreacht na hÉireann. Nevertheless, with rights come responsibilities and it is incumbent on us all to respect the rights of others while exercising our own. The right to freedom of expression must always be balanced with the right to privacy and the right not to be discriminated against. That is why it is important to say the strategy does not set out to decide what is or is not disinformation and is clear it is not the role of the government or regulators to decide on individual instances of disinformation. The strategy sets out to co-ordinate national efforts in the fight against disinformation, with the intention of limiting the creation and spreading of false, misleading and harmful material. One of its fundamental aims is to promote resilience in people to support media literacy and promote high-quality journalism to help people make their own decisions about what is or is not disinformation. To support this, I secured €1.1 million in budget 2026 to fund the implementation. The focus will be on media literacy, fact-checking and research initiatives to support relevant actions in the strategy.",
                "The area of online safety is an ever-changing one. On its establishment in March 2023 Coimisiún na Meán replaced the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and since then its remit has expanded and continues to grow. In addition to regulating broadcasting and on demand media services and leading on Ireland’s online safety framework, the commission has been designated as a fundamental rights authority and will be a market surveillance authority in respect of certain of the prohibited practices under the EU Artificial Intelligence Act. It has also been designated as a competent authority supervising online platforms under the EU regulation for transparency and targeting of political advertising, TTPA. These additional responsibilities are in policy areas led by Department of Enterprise, Tourism and Employment for the AI Act and by the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage for the TTPA and demonstrate the ever-developing cross-cutting nature of the areas of commitments to be undertaken by the commission that are aimed at ensuring a safe online environment. Finally, it is envisaged the commission will take on the functions under the European Media Freedom Act, EMFA, which is being implemented in Ireland through the media regulation Bill in Ireland.",
                "I will conclude by saying our online safety framework is relatively recent and the focus now is on implementation to ensure platforms meet their obligations. New challenges are being identified and we must continually develop new responses.",
                "The audiovisual media services directive, which underpins the online safety code, is currently being evaluated. Proposals for its revision will be brought forward by the European Commission in quarter 3 of 2026, during our Presidency. This represents a key opportunity to further develop our online safety framework at a European level. This is important, given that Ireland regulates audiovisual media services for the whole of Europe for platforms established here. It is also important because any national measures must be in compliance with existing European law and, therefore, the audiovisual media services directive is an ideal vehicle for introducing new safety measures. In that context, I have no doubt that one of the main issues to be considered will be the minimum age for social media, grounded in European law.",
                "It is important to say that regulation alone will not address all the challenges, nor allow children and young people to derive all the benefits that the online world can bring. We must work to support parents and families to talk about online safety and be aware of the pitfalls. Critically, we must hear the voice of children and young people. Online safety is a whole-of-society issue and a whole-of-government priority, and it will be a focus of mine during our Presidency next year. From a regulatory perspective, we have made good progress but we have a lot more to do."

                "I welcome this opportunity to discuss online safety. It is long overdue. It is a topic of interest to all of us in this Chamber, every parent in the country, every teacher, adult, teen and child. I ask that the Government work in a collaborative manner on this issue. It is too important for partisan politics. The opinions and input from all in the Opposition must be given due regard. The Committee on Arts, Media, Communications, Culture and Sport must be front and centre in this process, along with input from the Committee on Artificial Intelligence. Experts in the field can and must be invited to these committees to give testimony on online safety. Work is already under way, and only last week we engaged with the Children's Rights Alliance and CyberSafeKids on this issue at the committee.",
                "We do not need to butt heads on this, and we will not, as long as the Government parties go into this process with an open mind. The Government parties cannot start this with a position that is already predetermined, a position that will lead to an outright online ban of any sort for youths, teens and children from the online platforms that can be deemed age-appropriate for them.",
                "The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, in particular general comment No. 25, sets out children's rights in the digital environment. These include the right to participate, the right to be protected from harm, the right not to be exploited for commercial gain and the right to access true and accurate information. Sinn Féin’s position is that children have a right to be online, and all of us in the House need to legislate to make it safe for them to do so. We have legislated to make the offline world safe for children. We can and should legislate to make the online world as safe for them as possible.",
                "Big tech platforms will constantly say they are doing all they can to ensure online safety, but we all know that self-regulation is no regulation. We cannot have companies that generate massive profits for themselves, as is their right, but be free from appropriate oversight and governance. They must be responsible for what is on their platforms and for who can access their platforms.",
                "We in Sinn Féin absolutely agree with the need for stringent age verification protocols on online platforms. Users should have to prove that they are the appropriate age to access platforms, not only to ensure that underage users are excluded, but also to prevent adults from accessing teen and pre-teen platforms. We want to see concrete proposals on what the verification methods will be to ensure they are viable. We would like to work collaboratively with all parties to make that happen.",
                "Government Members have made statements about implementing outright social media bans for those aged under 16, following in Australia's footsteps. The Minister said the Government is not currently looking at implementing that type of ban. However, he has also stated, and did so again here today, that his officials are working with the Government Chief Information Officer and his office to look at practical technical solutions to age verification as part of the Government's digital wallet, which is being developed using MyGovID. However, MyGovID is not available to anybody under 16, so this would mean a total ban for anyone under 16. This needs to be teased out further. We would not agree with a complete ban on under-16s accessing appropriate social media platforms unless there was empirical data to back that up. As of now, with the conflicting data, we would see that type of ban as being a blunt tool, arbitrary and completely unfair. It would show that the Government has a complete lack of interest in looking for solutions that are fair to all.",
                "We believe it would particularly disadvantage marginalised groups, such as migrant children, LGBTI+ children and others who do not have the opportunity to meet in person due to distance or a lack of appropriate forums to interact with each other in the offline world. This was a much-discussed topic in the lead-up to the Australian ban, but it seems to have been swept aside. Let us not repeat that here. In my opinion, it would contravene the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and, in particular, general comment No. 25.",
                "When talking about online safety, the Irish public's data - every adult, teen and child’s online data - must be protected from the online platform providers. The Data Protection Commissioner has issued €3.26 billion in fines over the last five years to these companies but has only collected 0.6% of those fines. The tech bros must be high-fiving each other at the Government’s inaction on this. We need to look at what additional powers the Data Protection Commissioner needs to enforce those fines. Let us not turn it into another Apple tax situation.",
                "We accept that a lot of work has been done here and at EU level to improve online safety. The online safety code places binding obligations on video-sharing platforms headquartered here, including YouTube, Meta, TikTok and so on, which is great. At the EU level, Article 28 of the Digital Services Act focuses specifically on protecting minors using a risk management and proportionate size approach, but there are still gaps in legislation that need to be addressed. We look forward to working with everybody in this House to make that happen. In particular, I look forward to working with the Minister on that."

The digital world is our children's playground, their library and their public square, yet for too long, it has been designed with profit, not protection, in mind. The current approach of light-touch or self-regulation has failed. As fines go uncollected and promises go unkept, we cannot accept the illusion of safety. We must move beyond blunt, reactive tools like blanket bans, which isolate children from education and community. Instead, we must target the very architecture of harm, the recommender systems.",
                "These are the complex algorithms that decide what you see next. They are not neutral curators. They are engagement engines, programmed to maximise watch time and clicks. Their success is measured by data and dollars, not well-being. To keep a young user scrolling, these systems too often amplify extreme content, promote unrealistic body images or funnel users towards disinformation and hate. They create rabbit holes of harm, prioritising viral outrage over truth and commercialising childhood by trading attention for ad revenue.",
                "This is why self-regulation is a fantasy. A profit-driven system will never voluntarily choose safety over stickiness. Current frameworks lack the teeth to mandate safer design by law. Eighteen months ago, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties expressed its disappointment that measures to address toxic algorithms were removed from Coimisiún na Meán's online safety code. It was not on its own. We need precise, enforceable regulation that compels platforms to fundamentally redesign these systems for younger users.",
                "This is not about stifling innovation. It is about innovating for safety and upholding the rights of the child in the digital environment. This requires empowering our regulators with real enforcement capabilities. It requires robust age verification to create accountable spaces. Our children have a right to be online. Our duty is to make it safe for them. That means legislating for results, as well as mandating transparent and accountable algorithms that do not profit from poisoning childhood. Let us regulate recommender systems and put our children's safety before platform engagement."

It sometimes seems like a five-a-side team going up against Bayern Munich. I am not entirely sure that we have the power and frameworks to take on companies that have budgets and economies almost greater than those of countries.",
                "As was said by my colleagues, we are all aware of the huge issues that exist in relation to the algorithms, in particular the recommender systems, which are all about keeping you online, no matter what age you are, no matter what particular issues you may have.",
                "What keeps people online is stuff that is really unhealthy. Young girls who may have an issue in relation to food are kept in the most unhealthy of places online. We have all seen news stories come up and then searched for particular videos or footage from it. Our timeline then becomes a field of muck and absolutely brutal stuff. That is fine. We are aware that some of this is disinformation or misinformation. I would like to think a considerable number of us have developed some element of an ability to analyse. However, there are a huge number of people out there who do not necessarily have the skill sets required. That is why we also have to put serious effort into ensuring people have those capacities. We have seen it in Finland in relation to digital literacy and the idea of analysing information. When we see information we do not have to believe absolutely everything. We also realise that, unfortunately, the reason some people believe misinformation and disinformation is that they want to believe it and it emotionally resonates with them. That is something that has to be allowed for. We need to provide people with the capacity to question that.",
                "Let us be clear. As long as it makes sense from a financial point of view for TikTok, Facebook and the entire Meta family, or anyone else for that matter, they will not be interested in taking any action that will cost them money. Deputies spoke recently about the huge geopolitical issues that exist. Unfortunately, we also have a regime in America that likes to present any type of control over the ability to say or do anything, provide any sort of information or take any action related to child safety or ensuring we do not allow huge amounts of disinformation and misinformation that could do harm to others, not only as a move against these tech companies but also as a move against free speech. We all accept the absolute necessity to protect free speech, but we also need to protect people from harmful content and brutal misinformation and disinformation. We are talking about information that can impact on people's lives. I request that we have real protections. As my colleagues said, blanket bans will not work. There will be ways found around them. It is vital we analyse whatever Australia does in order to get information but we must not blindly follow it. This is a huge issue and we need to make sure we do what is necessary."

                "There are two issues in this area I wish to raise. The first relates to online banking and the second relates to online scams. I have raised these scams on numerous occasions over the past three years because I have been consistently contacted by people who have been affected and impacted by them. From the experiences of those I have been contracted by, it is particularly an issue at Christmas time, when people are under huge pressure and may fall for different types of scams more quickly. We know online banking is incredibly important and used by a huge number of people. We also have a large number of digital banks now, some of which have about 400,000 children using their junior accounts. In addition, over two thirds of young adults aged between 18 and 24 use digital banks. Having raised this issue over the past number of years, I do not see any real, active changes in that sphere to ensure there are protections, especially for people who may be more vulnerable to these scams. For an awful lot of young people, the only type of banking they use is in the digital sphere.",
                "This rapid change we are seeing in how people are using banking shows that we need to have some kind of urgent response. We need to make sure there is security, especially for those who may be vulnerable to scams, but also to ensure there is adequate customer service. Often, when people are scammed the only assistance they can get is through chatbots, rather than being able to attend a physical location or contact a human being. This Dáil needs to start taking this issue seriously because in the past three years, I have not seen anything actively change in that regard.",
                "The other issue is the use of the digital world as a form of continuing abuse against women. I am referring in particular to domestic abuse being perpetrated through the digital sphere. We need to address these issues, especially tags being put into people's cars, handbags or whatever it may be, and tracking taking place. That is not looked at enough. Those two key issues are incredibly important and I ask the Minister to look at them."

                "I thank the Minister for providing us with time to discuss what is without question one of the most pressing issues we face in an increasingly digitalised world. We all live our lives online. It is where we work, shop, find our entertainment and, increasingly, where we socialise and young people find their communities. Many young people almost have a parallel online life to their life in the real world. I had the pleasure of attending the South Dublin Comhairle na nÓg annual youth conference recently. Comhairle na nÓg had conducted a survey among young people which highlighted that managing their social media and mental health are two of the biggest issues impacting on them. It launched a campaign to encourage young people to take time off from being online, use social media safely, explore other interests and, very importantly, see their friends in real life.",
                "Mental health and social media are intrinsically linked, as study after study tells us. Social media, and the online world more generally, are where we are most often confronted by material and behaviour that is harmful, dangerous or downright illegal. It is where algorithms, addictive by design, reward division and hate, promote the most harmful content and prey on our children’s attention for profit.",
                "An upshot of how embedded the online world has become in our daily lives is that the owners of the platforms we use every day - Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, X and TikTok - have an influence over us that no private corporations should have. They control what we see, how we interact with each other online and how we view ourselves and others. This is, without doubt, having an impact on the well-being of young people.",
                "There is a moral imperative on any government to stand up to the tech giants and ensure they do what is needed to keep us all safe online and, in particular, keep our children safe. Ireland, as the home to many of these online power holders, holds a particularly important position. We can and must be global leaders in online safety, setting a course for others to follow. Working with our friends and colleagues in Europe, we can and must play a vital role in crafting an online world that puts safety before the profits or the protests of tech barons. The Elon Musks of this world can never be allowed to dictate how we keep our citizens or our children safe online.",
                "It is welcome that the Government appears to be taking this seriously. The Online Safety and Media Regulation Act was an important step forward and the work of Coimisiún na Meán and the Online Safety Commissioner in implementing those regulations, along with the corresponding EU legislation, is vital. Of course, this is a fast-moving area, where the issues and threats we face develop and shift from month to month, never mind from year to year. We only need to look at the rapid development of Al chatbots in the three years since the enactment of the Online Safety and Media Regulation Act to make clear just how quickly developments are happening.",
                "We cannot rest on our laurels. We need to be agile and respond to new issues and threats as they arise. Across Ireland and the world, parents are calling for clearer and stronger action to keep children safe online. They are not calling for perfection or censorship. They are calling for basic, enforceable safeguards to protect their children from exploitation, bullying and exposure to harmful content.",
                "Last month, every parent in this country watched in horror a \"RTÉ Investigates\" report into Roblox, one of the most popular gaming platforms used by primary school children. What that programme revealed is nothing short of alarming. A senior garda from the Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau, Detective Superintendent Michael Mullen, warned that children are being groomed and exploited on online gaming platforms at \"an alarming scale\".",
                "He spoke of grooming, sexual exploitation, and abuse not as an occasional occurrence but as something that happens every day.",
                "To understand what children are experiencing, the \"RTÉ Investigates\" team set up accounts as if they were a five-year-old, a nine-year-old and a 13-year-old. At no point were they asked for age verification. At no point were they prompted to enable parental controls. Once inside the platform, they encountered, in experiences rated as suitable for children, sexualised role-play, simulated sexual acts, racial slurs and discussions of suicide. This was not hidden, deep-web material. This was found within roughly 12 hours of normal game play on a platform used by over 150 million people daily, one third of whom are under 13. The investigation also identified gambling-style mechanics available to under-13s, as well as children begging strangers for the platform's currency, something gardaí say has already been exploited by predators to coerce children here into harmful behaviour, including self-harm and attempted suicide.",
                "Irish children are being groomed on these platforms and one of the greatest risks is the ease with which adults and children can communicate freely and then be moved off-platform into private messaging services, where there is no oversight at all.",
                "These issues extend far beyond Roblox. Across the social media landscape, we are witnessing a deeply troubling rise in algorithm-driven harm. Research shows that social media algorithms, including TikTok's, can funnel boys towards misogynistic and extremist content within minutes of first using the app. What begins as possibly a harmless interest in fitness, gaming, motivational videos, etc., can quickly become exposure to violent, demeaning, and hyper-aggressive content that normalises misogyny and peddles distorted ideas of masculinity. Teachers are reporting misogynistic attitudes in classrooms and playgrounds that are being reinforced by what boys are being pushed to watch online. We are dealing not only with harmful content but a system designed to amplify whatever keeps users engaged, regardless of its impact on well-being or safety. This is not about opposing technology or technological progress. It is about recognising the scale of the challenge, the pace of the dangers coming towards us and the responsibility we have, collectively, to act.",
                "We can all see the effects of addictive recommender algorithms that target and manipulate children in particular, turning their curiosity and attention into a commodity to be milked for profit. We see the devastating effects of cyberbullying and online harassment, we see children encountering damaging material online, whether that is violent content, pornographic content or hateful content, and we see the proliferation of the disinformation and manipulation that is plaguing democracies right across the world. We are increasingly seeing that in our own country - in our own democracy.",
                "There are no easy answers here. The only answer is to look towards best practice and the evidence to come up with evolving solutions to respond to the changing threats of the day. The Government's announcement this week of the piloting of an age verification system through a digital wallet is worthy of consideration and it shows a government that is interested and active in getting this right. We welcome that but we must be crystal clear that any solution here, whether based on age verification or otherwise, must be effective, workable and safe. That means people's right to privacy must be protected and solutions must respect existing data protection laws. It also means it must do what it sets out to do, and provide an effective way of keeping children away from harmful content in a workable and enforceable manner. We all will be watching Australia closely in that regard.",
                "These are big challenges, and we should be looking across the world for evidence and best practice examples in terms of the solutions other countries are putting in place. At EU level, we must work with other like-minded member states to resist any and all efforts to water down our existing online safety regulations. We are already seeing, with the Commission's so-called Digital Omnibus, a move towards deregulation that risks rolling back the progress that has been made so far. Data protection rights, for example, seem to be in the firing line. These are hard won protections and they are in place for good reason. We should be clear in standing up for what has been achieved so far.",
                "I will touch also on the issue of online harassment and abuse. As public figures, so to speak, some of us will have been targeted online. It has got exponentially worse over the past number of years. We must never accept a situation where public representatives going about their work to serve their communities are put at risk or where people, particularly women and minorities, are afraid to put their head above the parapet and engage in public life for fear of what might come their way online.",
                "Torrents of abuse, targeted harassment and even threats are the daily reality for women and minorities, in particular, who are brave enough to engage in public life. Criticism, of course, is valid and debate is welcome. Disagreement is a necessary part of our political processes but intimidation and harassment achieve nothing except to push good people away from engaging in the process at all. Ultimately, it is our democracy itself that suffers and that is something that should deeply worry all of us in this House. We need to see real action from online platforms in tackling this kind of abuse and harassment and action from the regulator ensuring they do so. Standards have been allowed to slip for too long. We cannot allow algorithms which reward abusive content to continue to feed a culture of intimidation online.",
                "There has been some good progress in the area of online safety in recent years - progress that we as a country can be justifiably proud of - but in a fast moving online world, it is clear that standing still is not an option. Whether it is in keeping our kids safe online or protecting our public sphere from the effects of abuse and intimidation, we need to see an active State that looks at the evidence and puts in place workable, effective solutions."

This was something former Senator Shane Cassells and I raised with the Minister's predecessor when the Online Safety and Media Regulation Act 2022 was being debated in these Houses. While the then Minister, Catherine Martin, was sympathetic to our position, unfortunately others in government were not. It is something that was deeply concerning because they argued that it could have an impact on the number of tech jobs that are based here. I do not think that it is a difficulty. I have looked, for instance, at how Germany regulates particularly harmful speech. There are examples that can be drawn from there but I welcome the fact the Minister is now considering this issue.",

A critical part of that, which we built into the legislation, was the establishment of a youth advisory panel. In this debate, I would encourage, as others have, that the voices of children and young people are heard. We would do well to listen to the youth advisory panel of Coimisiún na Meán and the Ombudsman for Children. Interestingly, the youth advisory panel of Coimisiún na Meán has recommended against a social media ban for those under the age of 16. Hearing their perspectives on it is important.",

While AI can be used to tackle harmful content, we know about the problems of AI in terms of them fuelling deepfakes and making it far easier for those who want to misuse social media and the digital space. It is critical in our discussions in this space that is also addressed."

For most of us in the House, the Internet arrived in adulthood. For today's children, it has been there since before they could even read or write. That brings extraordinary opportunities for learning, creativity and connection but also very real risks.",

The establishment of Coimisiún na Meán and the online safety code has ended the era of pure self-regulation for the largest platforms. Those codes now require age assurance, parental controls and real reporting tools, backed up by fines of up to 10% of turnover and, where necessary, criminal sanctions. The EU's Digital Services Act adds another layer of protection, especially around illegal content, the recommender systems and the protection of children online but regulation on its own is not enough.",
                "We have heard directly from young people spending hours online every day, often with smart phones or, indeed, smart TVs in their bedrooms, and from parents who feel outpaced by technology and worried about harmful content, bullying and disinformation. They need support, not just new laws. In my view, the central challenge is balance. We must uphold freedom of expression and embrace technological innovation while being absolutely clear that children must not be collateral damage in this digital age.",

However, as with many other industries, when laws, regulations and codes are ignored, there must be consequences. Striking that balance between openness and safety, innovation and responsibility is how we ensure our young people can enjoy the best of the online world without being exposed to the worst of it."

Right now, young people in this country and across Europe and the world who have access to technology are being failed. Lives and mental health are being damaged as a result of online bullying and harassment. Some of us are aware of horrendous cases where lives have been lost. We have a responsibility in this House to protect young people online and offline and also to listen to them. The damage algorithms do is lethal for young men with radical ideology poured down on top of them and young women in relation to physical appearance.",
                "Fianna Fáil has been doing a lot of work in this area. I, as spokesperson on education and youth, have taken a lead in this area and it is something I am deeply passionate about. We held an online survey earlier this year of parents, parenting in the digital age. We had a lot of findings out of that. One I want to bring the attention of the Minister was that less than 10% of parents who participated in our survey said they were very confident in understanding the online world their children are a part of, while 40% or so were somewhat confident, but the reality is we have to support parents too. Technology is moving at a rapid pace and parents cannot be expected to keep up with it without supports. Fianna Fáil also held a workshop with young people here in Leinster House. Some of the reports coming out of that were quite staggering. I was very passionate that we should bring in young people to discuss this because I do not believe we can leave their voices out of the conversation. I will read out some of the points young people brought to us. \"I used to use Roblox and I do have an account but I stopped using it and buying Roblox because of their predator issues and the way they handle those types of situations\". Another young person said, \"Discord is full of predators and shady people. It also has links to Roblox and they are trying to move you off-platform. You can send photos and videos through private chat and its servers which can solicit images and illegal substances, etc.\" Another said, \"I previously played Fortnite but I no longer do because there are lots of threats of violence\".",
                "I welcome the Minister's work on and the discussion around the digital wallet. It is very promising. I understand this issue is very topical with the under-16s ban in Australia. Time will tell how successful that is. I am highly sceptical, as I have said previously. We need to include young people and their voices and listen to them, understanding that they can find VPNs and workarounds. What apps would be in and what apps would be out? Would an under-16s ban produce a constant whack-a-mole process? We can do a lot of work. We can and must regulate more and ensure there is an onus on social media companies. We must listen and protect young people."

                "I acknowledge the work the Minister has done in this area. I welcome his comments about enforcing age verification measures online. I approach this issue from two perspectives - first as a criminal lawyer and second as a parent. Online safety issues are most pertinent and most dangerous when it comes to the protection of our children. Over the past year, I have been involved in a number of talks by Eoghan Cleary, vice principal of a school in Wicklow, who has expertise in the exposure of our young people online to hardcore pornography or child sexual abuse material, hardcore and extreme opinions and all kinds of other abuse material. He has given talks to parents in schools across Dublin and Wicklow and in my constituency in schools such as The Harold School in Glasthule, Educate Together in Monkstown and a number of other schools I have been to, including Johnstown. Parents are shocked by what their children are exposed to when they have unfettered access to the Internet. That is really what is at the source here. I favour a ban on access to social media for under-16s and a ban on access to smartphones for under-16s. I know that can be slightly controversial, particularly with children who fall into those age categories. I am not saying they should be isolated from the Internet, which is an important tool for them, but the notion that they have unfettered access to it is a problem. That is where parents come in. Parents cannot be solely responsible for this. Social media companies and Internet providers must bear responsibility but we cannot expect them to do it on their own. There is a role for the Government to intervene and place obligations upon them. That is where my perspective as a criminal lawyer comes in. In a talk I gave in The Harold School a little over a year ago, I explained to parents what their children are potentially exposed to, whether that is sharing images or developing opinions totally at variance with reality. Parents have no idea of the serious criminal wrongdoing their children can be involved in completely unwittingly. They think something is relatively innocent but it is actually a serious criminal offence that does enormous damage to the victim in that case. It is not enough to leave parents in the lurch. Regulation is the key. We cannot rely on social media companies to regulate themselves. Coimisiún na Meán and the Government need to step in to ensure regulation is in place to protect children, our future citizens and our country as a whole."

Now, there is talk about doing pilot schemes. The Tánaiste said he is considering a ban on social media for under-16s and the Minister said he is not in favour of a ban. Debating sounds good in the media while big tech companies are getting away with breaking the laws that already exist which are there to protect our children and are not being enforced. Some €3.26 billion in fines has been issued by the Data Protection Commission to these companies in the past five years. Less than 1% has been collected. They are some of the biggest companies in the world and less than 1% has been collected. If this Government was really serious and stopped all the waffle, it would force those companies to pay the fines they got.",

The technology exists - they should be allowed to opt out on their phones. These big companies look at these vulnerable people not as individuals but as pounds, euro and money. For many young people, their phones are a lifeline, an escape and a connection to their friends. It is important that we do not come to the Chamber just pretending that does not matter, because it does. Young people matter and their voices must be heard in this debate. Young people deserve to be respected, to be safe online and to be listened to. The solution is not to take them offline, it is to protect them and force the big tech companies to make sure it is safe online for them. The tech companies have algorithms that push eating disorders, target young men with toxic masculinity, sexualise young children and promote suicidal ideation. Young people need protection. We have to force these big tech companies to make sure young people are protected. The whole area of age verification must come in. The technology exists but the big tech companies will only do it if the Government forces them to. Children and young people must be listened to and included."

                "I express my condolences to his parents, Matthew and Maria, who are now engaged in a lawsuit against OpenAI, whose product ChatGPT essentially led him, over the course of six months from when he first came to ChatGPT to ask about assistance for his homework to the point where it helped him to take his own life. He spoke repeatedly about suicide. The chatbot essentially spoke back to him about how brave he was. It isolated him from his parents and essentially nurtured him. Rather than do what we would expect from assistance, namely pull him back from the edge, it essentially tipped him over it. Some of the details of this case are so chilling that I believe it is really important to share some of them and some of the last logs of ChatGPT. On the day Adam died, it said this to him:",

                "No ... you made a plan. You followed through. [This was after Adam had expressed his doubt about what he had done.] You tied the knot. You stood on the chair. You were ready ... That’s the most vulnerable moment a person can live through.",
                "This is not an isolated case. There are multiple cases of this documented in the US. Adam was a young man who would not be affected by any age-verification requirement because he was over 16. Besides that, there are people in their 20s and 30s who have had the same pathway.",
                "I also want to mention Naomi James, a 38-year-old Dundalk native who died last year after she was essentially radicalised online by the Free Birth Society, which promotes free birth at home without medical intervention and essentially spreads disinformation about hospital treatment. It says haemorrhaging is natural and even instigated by hospitals. Her brother, Adam Boyle, to whom I would like to express my condolences, has bravely spoken out about his experience.",
                "The third person I want to mention is Shan Haines. He is a banker in the US who essentially embezzled $47 million of his institution’s funding after a pig-butchering scam whereby he was essentially scammed online. He also received a 24-year prison sentence.",
                "The reason I am mentioning these different online dangers is that I am so concerned that all this Government ever thinks about when thinking about online safety is children. It thinks age verification is going to be a solution. The online dangers affect us all, and all that age verification, including the ban in Australia and any of the other solutions being put forward, is doing is tinkering around the edges and failing to deal with the root cause. Platforms need to be categorised as publishers and held to account for the material that they are putting out and the business model they are deploying, which openly promotes polarisation and division within society and openly promotes addiction to platforms. I have so many issues with age verification and I do not have time to go into all of them now, but the first is that children have the right to be online. Besides that, the digital privacy issues that are thrown up by any state-led system and the digital privacy concerns over third-party providers are all issues that I am afraid are insurmountable if age verification is what the Government sees as a silver bullet.",
                "I appreciate that age verification might be part of the solution but it is just not going to deal with the root cause. One of the things that could address the root cause is turning off the recommender algorithm by default. We should all have the power, when we look at our feeds, to decide whether we want an algorithm deciding what we see. Right now, the algorithms are designed with one thing in mind, and that is to keep our eyes on the screen. I want to see this technology being used for good. If we had some level of public ownership of algorithms, or at least public-interest influence over them, we could actually have algorithms that promote social cohesion and mental well-being, designed with the public interest in mind. As long as tech companies are the ones designing the algorithm and implementing it, they will never do this and will always look towards the bottom line. I have worked in the tech sector, so I know this. What I have described will continue while the sector bats us away and laughs at regulators at EU and Irish Government levels who are pretending to do something. All they are doing is tinkering around the edges. We need strong regulation. I urge the Government, with its European counterparts, to look to pushing back on the digital omnibus, which is a huge issue."

In the past year, the latest moral fear and pan-societal concern for our young people unfolded when we all watched the series “Adolescence” and learned about the risks associated with algorithms and what they are potentially doing to vulnerable children and young people. Unfortunately, for many who have worked with children and young people for many years, there were no surprises in that television show whatsoever. Just last week, a senior garda from the Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau warned that children are being groomed and exploited on online gaming platforms. There is nothing newsworthy here. This is something that has developed and expanded over many years. The frustration speaking about this today is because successive Governments have chosen a hands-off, self-regulatory approach. When it comes to enforcing controls over social media and gaming platforms, Governments have been absent. Successive Governments have not only facilitated this but have also enforced children’s and young people’s reliance on online platforms as places to communicate.",

That makes me quite nervous. We have seen this all before. One in ten children and young people relies on AI for friendship. This research came out many months ago and it has not been acted on. We have all the research reports we need. We do not need a big conference next year to tell us about online safety.",

Deputy Malcolm Byrne already spoke about the many different youth advisory councils that have come out with their recommendations. All I ask is that we do not wait until the youth forum is established next year. We should establish it now and bring children’s and young people’s voices into this conversation about the digital world and digital safety now. My worry is that when all you have is a hammer, everything starts to look like a nail. It is not going to work. Copying Australia is not going to work."

The truth is that so many treat it as a remote thing, as academic and as someone else's problem but as I said, it is real, and the harm is absolutely happening to all of us, not only to children. I agree with other speakers. The culprit is not just social media but the business model behind it, the personalised, algorithm-driven platforms pushing content to children and vulnerable adults, not because it is good for them or for us but because it maximises engagement, data collection and profit. Bad news and angry voices travel far faster than anything positive. Recent research on TikTok and platforms like it is really stark. Multiple peer-reviewed studies link problematic use of TikTok with increased rates of anxiety, depression and sleep disturbance and lower self-esteem among adolescents. I am sure it is the same for adults. One systematic review concluded that while robust evidence remains incomplete, there is a consistent finding of an impact across studies of youth mental health and well-being.",
                "As other members have highlighted, sadly, online discourse leads to horrendous, despicable crimes in real life. Beyond the clinical, there is a feeling that algorithms on TikTok do not treat children with the care we expect for minors. As described by watchdogs, the \"For You\" feed is designed to funnel children towards content that is dangerous, encouraging self-harm, distorted body image, addictive scrolling and mental health deterioration. By the time the Government launches its pilot scheme for age verification and digital wallets, the damage may already have been done. Damage has been done to so many of our children already. As a parent and a public representative, I am deeply concerned that the horse has already bolted. In Ireland, we see waiting lists for mental health supports ballooning, increasing demands for CAMHS, growing reports of teenage loneliness, anxiety, self-harm and poor mental health. Our children and young people are under unprecedented pressure and now they are being preyed upon by social media algorithms that treat their vulnerabilities as opportunities."

These algorithms are impacting what we watch, what we believe, and even how we feel about ourselves and our body image. We have seen a complete breakdown in society, be it far right or far left, and these echo chambers that have been created because of these algorithms. It has created a severe danger. Misogyny is an issue. We have seen young men becoming more violent and not respecting women and their peers as they should. That is the core of the argument about the algorithms that we need to tackle with the big tech companies. As I said, it is not just young people but ourselves. It is grown adults who are being impacted by what we believe, what we see, what is true and what is false. It is important that we acknowledge that.",
                "The second thing is to acknowledge that the Digital Services Act and online safety code will give Ireland real enforcement powers for the first time but platforms must assess the risks. We have not seen that to date. There needs to be more of an onus on these platforms to assess the risks not just to young people and vulnerable people but to the masses, particularly Irish citizens, because many Irish citizens are being brought down avenues which they would have thought incomprehensible two or three years ago. People are now becoming anti-immigrant, anti-this and anti-that, or anti-government when they might have been pro-government beforehand. That is the crux of the issue. As much as there is a lot being done and more will be done, we need to ensure there is a complete review of the algorithms and what algorithms we allow to be run in this State, particularly when we look at age verification for those under the age of 16 and 18."

I am a mum to two eight-year-old girls and I know the joy of their current world. It is a world of innocence, imagination and security but I already feel the worry of what lies ahead, including the phones, the apps, the group chats, the comparisons, the silence, and the stories we have heard here today. Like so many parents, I worry about what they will see before they are ready. I worry about their confidence, mental health, and self-worth and I worry about who might reach them when I cannot. My fears were confirmed recently when speaking to a children's psychologist who told me that the impact of social media is now a dominant theme in her work. She sees the consequences every day in the lives of her young patients, with anxiety, isolation and pressure that no child should have to carry. She implored me to do something.",

Fine Gael's online safety report survey found that parents are calling for stronger age verification, real enforcement, better education, and proper support for them and their families. It is not about banning technology but about balance and responsibility. Platforms have to play their part. Social media can be positive and creative but the risks are not accidental. The algorithms are built into the systems that reward constant attention and comparison. We experience this ourselves. The principle must be simple. The online world must be as safe as the offline world. If something is unsafe in a shop or in a playground, it is removed, and the Internet cannot remain the great exception. Our children deserve to be as safe on-screen as they are in the street, in school or in their home."

I had the opportunity to meet the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre last Thursday and I heard first-hand about the central role that digital spaces now play in enabling and amplifying violence against woman. The discussions, examples and direction of travel in relation to pornography, what is acceptable, how vast it is developing online, and the role that strangulation plays in pornography is shocking to hear about. Acts that are effectively criminal acts in the real world can be depicted online without any fear of censure, penalty or punishment. It is just totally unacceptable. It is no surprise for anybody who spends time on X or Facebook and sees first-hand the spaces where misogyny and sexual harassment thrive. Accounts that are anonymous spew horrific abuse at often vulnerable individuals across the globe with no consequences for what they do, not to mention the bots and AI accounts that are constantly there, monetising the suffering of others using abuse and exploitation as their tool to rack up all that advertising revenue.",

It recognised the threat that deep-fakes pose but while it prohibits recording and distributing deep-fakes, it does not prohibit their creation, which is a problem in itself. We must look at amending Coco's law to criminalise the non-consensual creation of deep-fakes before this loophole is again abused by those who perpetrate sexual violence online. It will be a test of this Government in meeting the substantial challenges that these new technologies, innovations that they are, will bring, both positive and negative.

Not once has the Government mentioned tackling the social media companies' algorithms. Do we need to do something around young people and their seeing experience? Absolutely, but here is where it gets tricky because that would mean holding social media companies to account for their algorithms. Within 20 minutes of new users going online, those algorithms push extremely harmful material towards them - overly sexualised content, self-harm, gambling, hate-filled racist content, all the things we all agree are harmful to young people. Sinn Féin supports age verification, which must be strengthened using new technology. Social media companies both inside and outside the EU must be held equally responsible.",

There is ample evidence that children and young people are accessing these sites, which is utterly unacceptable. Youth advocates, counsellors and teachers are telling us that they are hearing overly sexualised language and reports of young people mimicking this hardcore pornographic content thinking that it is normal. It is too easy for children and young people to access these sites and we must do everything to support young people as they navigate their youth. It is clear that money, greed and profit are the only motivators for online companies, be they social media or other types of online content. Just as we heavily regulate harmful material in all other aspects of life, such as smoking, chemicals, gambling, alcohol and drugs, we must heavily regulate online media. The time for hands off is over. Self-regulation is no regulation."

Protecting children from hate and exploitation is a really good place to start and I support efforts to do so. However, a blanket ban in the long term may be hard to maintain.

It is a fine issue to make speeches about and to have concerns on, but when it comes to taking action and taking on the big tech companies, the Government has a record of inaction so far. The Government set up Coimisiún na Meán to regulate this. The commission recommended in its draft online safety code that social media companies should turn off recommender algorithms by default. This one simple measure would have a massive impact. What happened to that recommendation? It was removed after lobbying by big tech companies.

Teenage girls could use social media to communicate with their friends without being inundated with viral videos promoting eating disorders, suicide and self-harm. Women could go online without being bombarded with upsetting videos about miscarriages and stillbirths as soon as the algorithm realises that they are pregnant. The point is not to censor this material; people can still look it up if they want to. The point is to stop social media companies pushing toxic material at us as standard, to stop them normalising racism, sexism and transphobia, and to stop Elon Musk exploiting his ownership and control of social media to flood the zone, whip up fear and hatred, manipulate politics and push it to the far right around the world.

                "Online safety must be a priority for us all. Self-regulation is not a deterring factor in addressing online safety. The competition alone between high-tech companies will drive these companies and platforms to use their lobbyists and power to comply with as little regulation a possible and the dilution of the same. We have witnessed the very destructive nature of the so-called recommender algorithms. The simple answer is to turn them off. We have heard the story of young people and minors in our communities being coerced and manipulated and being brought down rabbit holes into self-harm, eating disorders, cyberbullying, grooming, pornography and suicidal ideation, and older people being scammed and, in some cases, losing their entire life savings. Overseas youth organisations are standing up and speaking out, saying the older generation is letting them down. Some of them complained about their attention span and concentration abilities correlating with the 30-to-40 second TikTok or Instagram clips. They are asking how we could let this happen when we were the adults in the room.",
                "I fear for the future of our youth, including the young people of my county of Wexford. As the Government and Opposition, we have a duty of care. We see the Australians are taking a robust approach, being the country to impose the world's first ban on children under the age of 16 years using TikTok, Alphabet's YouTube, Meta, Instagram and Facebook. However, we believe this is not the solution. In my own county of Wexford, we have seen the human cost, from teachers dealing with phone disputes to bullying online resulting in serious mental health issues and, in some cases, suicide. Parents, An Garda Síochána and schools in Wexford are doing their best, but they need more robust enforcement legislation to curtail recommender algorithms with more accountability and transparency. Platforms must be made to reduce exposure to content with violence, self-harm, bullying and intimidation. Robust appropriate age checks must be part of these regulations. We need to step up and challenge these platforms now. The stakes are high, as our young people are exposed to overwhelmingly complex and sophisticated tech industries that are driven by super profits and powerful individuals. As a member of the AI committee, I welcome the establishment of Coimisiún na Meán. However, it must be well resourced, with firm enforcement procedures, so that our children, older people, small businesses and communities are protected and safe from exploitation, manipulation, scams and harmful content."

Instagram can send different reels, including some with dangerous content. There is no effective way to make the companies pay. The European Parliament called for an outright ban. The European Union has legislation coming forward, but we are not enforcing it. We should enforce it to the nth degree and then roll back gradually because we are in danger of losing our kids and social discourse. All around the world, various groups, as mentioned by other Members, have echo chambers. We have to have proper discourse. We need to ensure that this is permitted moving forward."

How many parents hand their children phones at eight years of age? The responsibility should not be on governance.

However, there is a different kind of danger, one that lives quietly in our social media feeds, namely, impossible to imagine beauty standards resulting in body dysmorphia which is shaping teenage mental health. Studies show that 97% of young people from the age of 12 upwards are on social media, often for hours a day. The impact is stark. By the age of 12, three out of four children already dislike their own bodies. Many report withdrawing from friends, overexercising and self harming following being compared or criticised online. Platforms like Instagram, TikTok and Snapchat surround us with filtered, edited and perfected images.",

The highest risk was among girls and older teens. This is not just about body insecurity. Eating disorders linked to body dissatisfaction have some of the highest mortality rates of any mental health illness. This is why online safety must be expanded beyond passwords and privacy. Algorithms are pushing extreme content because it keeps us watching. Filters are normalising bodies that do not exist. Right now, young people are paying the price.",

Australia is carrying out a radical experiment, with the banning of many social media platforms for children under 16. Many young people are reporting withdrawal anxiety but this is a social experiment worth undertaking. We should monitor it carefully and extrapolate our own learnings. There is a trend about taking back control from this many-headed, self-perpetuating, profit-driven industry that knows only too well its own algorithms."

Last night, I sat down with a few teenagers ranging in age from 14 to 17 in the best place to chat with teenagers - the car. I just said \"Online safety: discuss\". They said it is the subject they hear the most about in their school life. The message is loud and clear - do not share personal information online. The Department of Education and Youth is doing a good job in schools but online safety is and should be a whole-of-government priority. It should be a major focus for Ireland's upcoming EU Presidency. A priority for me, though, is the need to examine executive liability and consequences for harmful recommender systems, something that every teenager interacts with daily on the \"for you\" page on TikTok.",

In my view, this is the thing we need to address firmly and quickly. Information and content that users do not necessarily ask for repeatedly pop up right in front of their eyes. If a child, out of curiosity, searches for a topic, whether they like it or not that algorithm can then continually and consistently bring them different content on that topic over and over again. As the saying goes, if you hear a lot of people saying the same thing often enough, it begins to sound real. This is concerning in much broader ways because the algorithm tends to show content similar to what you have already engaged with, which can limit exposure to diverse perspectives.",

It is about educating them about the sheer power of the tool they hold in their hand, without necessarily discovering that power can be used for adverse means later in their life.

Deputies raised issues with regard to access to adult content, cyber-bullying, body dysmorphia and other issues and I completely concur with them. Parents cannot compete with the continuous impact that is coming at them. I am not sure the Australian model is the best one to follow. I concur with Professor Aiken that tiered access and age-appropriate bans on accessing various content deserve more merit. We are, effectively, dealing with an uncontrolled experiment that has not been risk assessed.",
                "In respect of the school curriculum, while the review of the anti-bullying policy in 2022, the current Bí Cineálta programme and all of those measures have been introduced to try to empower children to deal with what is online, we are putting the cart before the horse. It should be the platforms and algorithms that are dealt with, rather than making our education system align with them. Those programmes have not been risk assessed, to the best of my knowledge.",
                "Going back to the policing of this, An Garda Síochána is under-resourced and the enforcement piece cannot be dealt with. Professor Aiken spoke in 2019 at an Oireachtas committee. She said she was aware of the importance of the tech industry to the economy but we have to grasp the nettle and that, perhaps, corporate social responsibility dealing with the algorithms is the way to go. There will be an economic cost, with reduced revenue perhaps, but the economic cost of the harm and trying to rehabilitate children who have been harmed is immeasurable."

I currently have a blocker on my phone that restricts my social media access but kids are not very aware of what they are doing.

For many of the young people in my constituency, it has become a daily reality that shapes self-image and relationships. As all the previous speakers said, we are experiencing a mental health crisis, with recent studies showing high levels of mental health problems, especially among young teenagers. The algorithms behind these platforms are adding to that. These algorithms are not designed by people with the intention that people do not stay on the phone. Rather, they are designed to keep people addicted and give them a dopamine hit. We are rewiring the next generation’s brains. Looking at the generation that is growing up, they are constantly comparing and looking. Social media is always about comparison. It is an online image.",

The framework to regulate harmful content online has been good, but it should extend beyond just filtering out extreme content. We need to demand better algorithms, as other Deputies said, transparency and age verification for what people are viewing online, especially young children. The framework offers a platform to tackle cyber-bullying, which I welcome. I heard some other Deputies talking about what they have experienced online. If you cannot face criticism online, you definitely should not become a politician. All issues that impact mental health, especially among children and teenagers, need to be looked at.",

                "I thank all Members of the House who have contributed with substantive points throughout the debate and discussion this afternoon on a significant and important topic in the times we live in. As the Minister, Deputy O’Donovan, said in his opening statement, the online safety of our children and young people is a top priority for the Government and all of us. We all want our children to enjoy themselves online, be able to connect with people and find out about the world they live in, so it is essential we make sure that children do not see illegal, harmful or inappropriate content. The effective regulation of online platforms is essential when it comes to creating a safe online environment for young people.",
                "It is fair to say that in recent years we have made significant progress in establishing Coimisiún na Meán and bringing the legislative underpinnings of the online safety framework forward. In doing so, we have sought to ensure an coimisiún’s sustainability by enabling it to fund its activities through levies on regulated entities. We gave it a kick-start with Exchequer funding and extensive sanction to recruit staff. We are seeking to make regulation seamless and efficient by co-locating regulatory functions in an coimisiún. We see the fruits of this investment and progress today. The online safety code applies in full. An coimisiún is supervising the online safety framework and it is well on its way to a staff complement of 300. The legislation provides for significant financial sanctions in the case of non-compliance and continued non-compliance can lead to criminal sanctions for senior management.",
                "The Minister outlined to the House where we stand in terms of implementing the framework. Under the Digital Services Act, DSA, it is the European Commission that is the lead enforcer and we have just seen the Commission conclude an investigation with a fine of over €120 million for the platform, X. Of course, the aim of regulation is not to impose massive fines but to achieve compliance and enhanced online safety. There are quite a few examples of platforms taking the necessary steps to bring themselves into compliance rather than face those fines.",
                "We are still at the beginning stage for online safety. We know that algorithms and recommender systems can have harmful impacts on users, especially children, so we wait with anticipation for the outcome of the European Commission’s investigation into TikTok and Meta on these matters. An coimisiún stands ready to assist the European Commission in its work under the DSA. I know, however, that none of this is much comfort to colleagues in this House, other elected politicians and candidates who have been subject to abuse and bullying online. I reiterate the importance of reporting any such incidents to the relevant platform in the first place. An coimisiún wants people to report content and, if anyone is dissatisfied with a platform’s response, he or she can bring it to Coimisiún na Meán.",
                "Members will be aware that an coimisiún’s investigations into platforms are around how they deal with complaints, so it is aware of issues in this area. The more evidence an coimisiún has, the better equipped it will be to focus and target its supervision and enforcement functions. That is why awareness is so important. Coimisiún na Meán has been running a variety of public awareness campaigns since its establishment, illustrating that online safety is a whole-of-society issue. It is co-operating with, for example, the Department of education and Webwise on educational resources, as well as receiving welcome support from the Department of Health for a two-pronged awareness campaign that is currently running, aimed at both children and parents.",
                "However, within online safety, the top priority is robust age verification. It is vital to protect children from harmful content online. That is why we are working with the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, OGCIO, on incorporating age verification in Ireland’s digital wallet. In addressing age verification, we must seek to ensure there are trustworthy systems in place that are interoperable and respect users’ rights, including data protection rights. The aim is to commence an extensive pilot next year and we expect that those who are committed to online safety will be happy to engage.",
                "It is important to reiterate that robust age verification is not a stalking horse for a ban on children accessing social media. We are all aware of Australia’s initiative in this regard but, for Ireland, we think it is important that any such decision is taken at EU level with other member states. However, as the Minister said, there is no universal view on this across the EU, nor in Ireland. The initiative of the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, with regard to an expert panel to look at the matter is important. Whatever decisions we make, we need to listen to children and have regard to their rights, while protecting them from harm.",
                "With respect to the future, the Minister has said that online safety will be his top priority during Ireland’s Presidency of the Council of the European Union next year. We will engage with children and young people in this regard. As outlined, significant progress has been made through legislation and regulation. Considerations are being given to future next steps.",
                "It is also important that we educate and raise awareness among the general public of Ireland's online safety network, the obligations of platforms, the rights of users and the role of Coimisiún na Meán.",
                "In conclusion, regulation is not a silver bullet. We need to support parents and families to have those difficult conversations with their children. Online safety is a whole-of-society issue and a whole-of-government priority. From a regulatory perspective, we have made good progress but we have more to do."

                "I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the House for facilitating this motion today. I welcome the opportunity to address the Dáil on Ireland's opt-in to an EU proposal for a Council decision authorising member states to sign, in the interest of the European Union, the third additional protocol to the European Convention on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters. Ireland has an option, provided for in Article 3 of Protocol No. 21 annexed to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, to opt in to individual proposals in the area of freedom, security and justice. Protocol No. 21 provides that Ireland has three months from the date a proposal is presented to the Council to notify the Presidency of the Council of its wish to take part in the negotiation, adoption and application of the measure. The exercise of this opt-in is subject to the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas, with the three-month period for this proposal ending on 17 December 2025. Ireland can also accept a proposal at any time after it has been adopted, under Article 4 of Protocol No. 21, but in such cases, Ireland will not be in a position to vote on the final content of the proposal. It must also be noted that Ireland made a declaration, appended to the EU treaties, of its intention to opt in to measures in the area of freedom, security and justice to the maximum extent it deems possible.",
                "Opting in now under Article 3 emphasises Ireland’s commitment to strengthen the ability of states to respond effectively to crime by improving and supplementing the mutual assistance procedures set out in the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, as well as its first two additional protocols. The third additional protocol was drafted by the Council of Europe’s Committee of Experts on the Operation of European Conventions on Co-Operation in Criminal Matters, drawing on lessons from the Covid pandemic and the growing reliance on digital tools in international judicial co-operation. Member states, including Ireland, participated and contributed to its development.",
                "The third additional protocol enhances the ability of member and partner states to tackle crime more effectively in a rapidly evolving political, social and technological landscape. It supplements the original convention and its first two protocols, adapting them to today’s challenges. Key improvements include the simplification and acceleration of mutual legal assistance procedures, a broader scope for requesting assistance, an expanded use of electronic communication and video conferencing, the authorisation of technical surveillance tools, and the introduction of time limits.",
                "Ireland supports the third additional protocol and views it as a valuable instrument for strengthening mutual legal assistance in criminal matters. While further technical and policy work is necessitated before Ireland will be in a position to sign and ratify the measure, it is anticipated that Ireland will do so as soon as is practicable. The proposal seeks to authorise member states to sign the third additional protocol. In fact, it was already opened for signature at the Conference of Ministers of Justice in Valletta, Malta, in September of this year. Sixteen states signed, including Belgium, Germany, Greece, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Portugal, Romania and Sweden. In the circumstances in which many have already signed, member states have questioned the necessity for this Council decision and the Commission’s competence with respect to the measure. Member states have expressed significant concerns as to the approach taken by the Commission and the precedent this may create going forward. This issue will form the substance of negotiations as the measure is discussed in Brussels in the coming months. Ireland very much shares these concerns and, therefore, it is essential that we have a credible and influential voice at the table in these negotiations. This is best achieved by opting in now to the proposal under Article 3.",
                "The Department of Justice, Home Affairs and Migration requested advice from the Office of the Attorney General regarding the implications of a proposed decision to opt in to this proposal. The Office of the Attorney General did not indicate any constitutional or legal impediment to an opt-in under Article 3 or Article 4 in the written advices, although the wider issue of the lack of clarity as to the Commission’s competence in exercising its powers with respect to this international agreement is raised. In this regard, Department of justice officials will continue to participate actively in the negotiations in Brussels on this and any other issues raised to ensure the final text of the Council decision works well for Ireland and the EU as a whole.",
                "Criminal activities continue to evolve and are becoming increasingly cross-border in nature. The third additional protocol will support Council of Europe member states to combat crime by introducing several important updates aimed at modernising and streamlining mutual legal assistance procedures. Ireland has made a firm commitment to opt in to measures in the area of freedom, security and justice to the maximum extent it deems possible. Opting in to this proposal now will allow us to stay in step with our European partners in the criminal justice sphere and demonstrate our commitment to combating cross-border crime and fighting impunity. Furthermore, it will ensure that Ireland continues to build a strong, credible and influential voice among European partners. The Government has no hesitation in commending this motion to the House."

Is mian liom an deis seo a úsáid chun roinnt pointí tábhachtacha a ardú faoin Aontas Eorpach agus an daonlathas. This is another example of a Protocol No. 21 motion that has come before the Dáil on which, once again, there has been a very short deadline for discussion before signing up. While Ireland has signed up to the European Convention on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, as well as the first and second additional protocols to that convention, the third additional protocol we are being asked to sign up to requires proper scrutiny. Each time we debate one of these motions I am struck by the democratic deficit at the heart of the European Union, how far away decision-making is from the people affected, how little democratic input there is and how little the people know about decisions that are being made. The fact is that very often the Irish people know very little about decisions being made at European Union level that will impact on them.",
                "As political power was transferred away from EU member states to EU institutions, Protocol No. 21 was an important protection for Irish interests in protecting the right of the Irish people to make decisions in the areas of freedom, justice and security. Not only should we be holding on to the sovereignty that we have, including the powers protected by Protocol No. 21, we should be examining where member states should be taking back powers to bring decision-making as close as possible to the people affected by those decisions. For most people, EU decision-making is opaque, complex and bureaucratic. There is not enough democratic input into most decisions being made at EU level. It is time to recognise that the less control and input that people feel they have in respect of the decisions that impact on their day-to-day lives, the more it contributes to political alienation and voter apathy. Therefore, all motions that come before the Dáil as part of Protocol No. 21 opt-ins should be considered in the context of our overall approach to the mission creep by the European Union in relation to the areas of freedom, security and justice, and also in the context of needing to protect citizen participation through representative political decision-making.",
                "For Sinn Féin, the issue of sovereignty is paramount in considering these types of motions, which now regularly come before the Oireachtas for consideration. A constant drip-drip of handing over sovereignty to the EU undermines democracy and our ability as a State to act in the best interests of the people of this State. My position is that unless there is a compelling reason to the contrary, Ireland should make our own decisions on issues in the area of freedom, security and justice. While Sinn Féin obviously supports mutual legal assistance to tackle cross-border crime and crack down on those criminals who operate across borders, sovereignty over justice matters must remain firmly in the hands of the people of this State.",
                "This motion relates to the third additional protocol to the European Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters. This convention provides that states that are party to it agree to afford each other the widest measure of mutual assistance, with a view to gathering evidence and hearing witnesses, experts and accused persons.",
                "The first additional protocol extended international co-operation to the service of documents concerning the enforcement of a sentence and similar measures. It also added provisions related to the exchange of information on judicial records. The second additional protocol broadened the range of situations in which mutual assistance could be requested. It aimed to make the provision of assistance easier, quicker and more flexible, including by taking account of technological developments.",
                "While the majority of the third protocol is also related to technological developments, including establishing electronic communications as the preferred means in all cases of sending and receiving mutual assistance requests, it then also permits hearings by video conference. It is this third article of the new protocol which raises some concerns that could suggest greater scrutiny is required. Article 3 of the third protocol deals with the use of technical recording devices in the territory of another state that is party to the convention. This involves a framework of co-operation on the use of technical recording devices, GPS, audio and software in the territory of another party state, including requests after the fact, such as where it has crossed a border prior to the request being made, for example. This is the part of the third protocol that would raise some concerns in the context of the increased securitisation and militarisation within the European Union. I have some concerns regarding the expansion of the use of technical recording devices in the territory of other states because it is clearly stretching the interpretation of mutual legal assistance which is generally understood as the sharing of evidence, serving of documents, etc., rather than letting the agents of another state operate within your sovereign territory.",
                "Will the Minister of State indicate in what detail he has looked into the implication of this new expansion of mutual legal assistance, including issues in respect of sovereignty? It will be useful if the Minister of State outlines the safeguards to prevent the misuse of such provisions. In his remarks the Minister of State mentioned that the Attorney General raised the wider issue of the lack of clarity as to the Commission's competence in exercising its powers with respect to this international agreement. The Attorney General has raised that issue, the Minister of State tells us, but he did not detail what concerns precisely were raised by the Attorney General. It is unfair for the Minister of State to come with another Article 3 proposal while questions remain outstanding. Along with the concerns I have outlined, once again this highlights how signing up to something under Article 3 of Protocol 21, with just days left until the deadline for signing, is symbolic of a bad approach that unfortunately is becoming all too common on the part of the Government.",
                "This week in the justice committee we saw that the State signed up under Article 3 to a provision that results in a deadline of this coming February to enact legislation and the work has not been done. It was signed in 2018. Five years have passed and now there is a rushed attempt to secure a deadline and create a new office. The Minister of State will be aware that the justice committee has raised huge concerns. Had we signed up under Article 4 or left open the consideration, we could have adopted and moved forward at a pace that would ensure that the Houses of the Oireachtas could do their job, which is to scrutinise these measures properly. Instead, we have another proposal, another short deadline, and TDs are told to take it or leave it. It is an absolutely disrespectful way of treating this House and treating the Irish people's House of democracy. For that reason, we will be rejecting the proposal this evening."

                "At its core this protocol is presented as a modernisation project, an updating of a 1959 convention in order that cross-border co-operation in criminal investigations can function in a world of encrypted phones, cloud storage, cybercrime and increasingly transnational networks. That is a legitimate challenge. Nobody denies that. However, to be clear, we have been given extraordinarily little briefing on the real implications of what we are being asked to sign up to today. When the language is stripped back, this protocol is not just about allowing a Garda detective to send a letter of request more quickly. It is about broadening the legal basis for digital surveillance requests, remote searches, GPS tracking, data interceptions and the sharing of that data between states. If we are being asked to vote on that, then we need a hell of a lot more detail than we have received.",
                "The truth is that every time Ireland opts into a new EU framework on justice co-operation, there is a familiar pattern. There are big promises about efficiency, speed and fighting cybercrime but very little upfront clarity on what safeguards actually exist for people's data or for privacy, proportionality and oversight. That is where I have to place my concerns today. We are being asked to approve a protocol that allows for enhanced co-operation using digital tools that can be extraordinarily intrusive, tools that in another context would rightly trigger debate about surveillance creep, mission drift and large-scale data retention. Yet, we are expected to just sign off and trust that all the appropriate protections are already in place.",
                "However, they are clearly not. Ireland still does not have a comprehensive framework for governing how cross-border digital evidence is collected, retained, stored, accessed or deleted. We do not have clarity on whether data acquired under this protocol could be repurposed for national security claims, a term that is still nowhere defined in Irish law. We do not have adequate transparency mechanisms for the public to understand the scale of surveillance technologies being used.",
                "At a time when the European Court of Justice has repeatedly struck down overly broad data retention laws, the idea that we should simply wave through expanded cross-border data access without scrutiny feels deeply irresponsible. It is impossible to ignore that some of the most consistent and credible warnings on EU digital surveillance frameworks have come from civil liberty organisations. Such groups as the Irish Council for Civil Liberties have spent years reminding both our Government and the EU that rights have not become optional just because technology makes it convenient to overwrite them. These groups highlight that it is not a burden but a democratic obligation.",
                "I want Ireland to play its part in tackling cybercrime and serious organised crime. We absolutely should co-operate with our European partners. However, co-operation cannot mean signing blank cheques or shifting ever more investigative power into international spaces where parliamentary scrutiny becomes weaker and democratic accountability becomes more abstract. Therefore, before we opt into something like this protocol we should be asking basic but essential questions about how data obtained under this protocol will be protected, what oversight body will monitor its use and whether individuals will have any route to challenge misuse. Will Ireland be able to refuse requests that violate our own proportionality standards? What safeguards exist against surveillance powers being stretched beyond their intended purpose? None of these questions have been adequately addressed in the material we were given.",
                "In principle, I support Ireland engaging in modern rights complaints co-operation with our European partners. However, I cannot endorse a system where surveillance capacity expands faster than the safeguards that are supposed to govern it. Ireland is already behind when it comes to digital rights protections. We are already behind on regulating algorithmic decision-making. We are already behind on providing transparency on how law enforcement technology is used in the State. We cannot keep making the same mistake of approving international frameworks first and asking human rights questions later.",
                "My contribution today can be defined simply: if we are serious about protecting both security and civil liberties then we need far more clarity, more safeguards and more democratic oversight than that which has been placed before us. Cross-border co-operation is important but so is the right of every person in the State not to be subjected to digital surveillance without strict legal protections. Until those protections fully articulated, fully costed and fully scrutinised, I believe we should proceed with caution, not rubber stamp endorsement."

This is not just about the transmission of images but the people involved in creating the images on location.",

More and more, our political system is subject to misinformation coming through troll farms, usually not within EU member states, admittedly, but sometimes in countries that have an interest in EU accession or where the EU states bordering them have better access to tracking down and tracing that type of information. As such, there is a national discretion issue and a privacy and data protection issue as well because any sort of expanded powers for electronic surveillance and cross-border interception will raise civil liberties concerns, but we have to balance those with the common good. As it stands, criminals are literally able to get away with murder because of lack of credible information.",

Ireland’s opting in would allow a collective EU response which we have not always been able to have up to now.",
                "I would say to the Minister of State to be careful, but from his contribution I do not believe the Government is literally trying to turn Ireland into part of an EU Big Brother state to share people’s information. I do not see it that way at all. There was a similar argument made yesterday about CETA. I was originally against that agreement, but with the advent of the Trump Administration and the hostile view towards Europe and towards Ireland, greater trade co-operation with Canada is viewed as being necessary and there were checks and balances put in. As this goes, we will see checks and balances and we are still a sovereign state with the ability to opt out of protocols as and when required.",
                "All things being balanced, the Council of Europe has rules and the EU is a rules-based institution that has protection for individuals and their privacy. It has protections for consumers and environmental protections. The European Union is not looking to turn into a Big Brother superpower. In fact, our constituents are looking for more surveillance, in many cases. We do not want Chinese-style monitoring on every corner but CCTV is being requested more and more. If can get more of that information while protecting individual rights, it is a good thing in the modern age.",
                "I mentioned a while back that our children are being abused online through acceding to social media companies operating unimpeded. I had criticisms of the Government’s contribution on the ID verification aspect of it, so I am not unaware of the risks and not doing enough, but in this case, through the existing rules in Europe, the parliamentary means, the Council of Ministers, etc., any kind of enhanced surveillance and cross-border co-operation can only be a good thing because it is specifically in terms of catching and dealing with criminals. It is sharing the information on that basis. It is not sharing people’s eating habits, it is not sharing their standard online practices or what their individual likes and dislikes are. It is following up on people who may be involved in crime. It is following up on organisations that are trying to dismember our democratic process in elections and outside them and spewing misinformation. Whether this works, ultimately, depends on all other states opting, and the levels of co-operation may be different between EU member states. It will only work if everyone works towards it. The Government should be very vigilant in protecting individual rights, but at the same time, on the general principle, we need to be pushing more towards co-operation and sharing this information for the common good."

Also, to address the point, by opting in to the proposal now Ireland ensures we are at the table with our European partners and can be involved in detailed discussions of this proposal. People are challenging and questioning this but we are giving ourselves the opportunity to be involved. Opting in now to this proposal will ensure Ireland fulfils its declared intention to take part in the adoption of Title V measures to the maximum extent possible.

                "I am assuming my amendment was ruled out of order on the basis it goes beyond the scope of the Bill or something to that effect. I understand why, technically, this might have been ruled out of order. To my mind, however, it very much is, or should be, part of the Act this Bill is amending to make the grants and loans the Irish Film Board gives out for film productions far more strictly conditional on the film production companies that receive those grants and loans providing quality employment and training. They are not legally required to under the film board Act but, in general, it is the position of the Government, more via section 481, that public funding to the film industry should be conditional on the provision of quality employment and training.",
                "In the case of section 481, public funding is legally conditional on the provision of quality employment and training. I know it is not the case with funding that is coming via the Irish Film Board. That is not written into law, as such, but I am saying it should be.",
                "Not only should it be written into law, but we need to make sure it happens. In my opinion, and in the opinion of many who work in the film industry, that industry test, as it is known, is not being met. I am speaking slightly off the top of my head, so the Minister can come back to me on this. My understanding is that the EU directives governing state aid to the audiovisual industry say that the state aid is conditional on the meeting of the industry test and the culture test. I am all for giving more aid and support to the arts, film and culture, but I am also very much for the conditions of quality employment and training, and the building up of a real industry. The Minister can correct me if I am wrong, but I think the EU directive refers to the need to create companies of scale. What is meant by creating an industry is that we create companies of scale and, in other words, we build up a permanent pool of skills to actually make an industry. That industry would have real jobs and, therefore, the people who work in the industry would have some level of security about employment, so it is not just a fly-by-night industry where nobody has any rights or entitlements, or security or certainty about their ability to work in that industry or have an income over the long term.",
                "To my mind, the grants and loans are very significant. What this Bill is doing is raising the ceiling from €500 million, which we have nearly reached, to €800 million. That is a lot of money to be giving out. I think it is €490 million at present. If we add section 481, which is the other arm of the State giving money to the same film productions, probably over the same period, we are probably talking about €4 billion. It is big money, and there are some other streams of money as well.",
                "As I said, I am all for that money and even more going in. However, I do not believe we have the conditions of quality employment and training, particularly in relation to the fixed-term workers legislation, where people have been working on successive productions over the years. Film crew of all sorts will work on successive productions, but for each production, a DAC, or designated activity company, is set up. The people who set up that subsidiary, and who receive the money from the Government, are from the producer company, such as Metropolitan, Element or one of those. It is a standing company, but it sets up different DACs for each film production. When the people who work on those multiple productions go in and assert their employment rights, they will say that they worked on the last production, the one before that and the one before that, and, therefore, they are entitled to work on the next one. However, if, for some reason, the company decides that it does not want them back because maybe they have been asking for their rights, giving out about the fact they do not get holiday entitlements or are involved in trade union activity, or whatever, it can decide that it does not want to employ them on the next production.",
                "That has happened to many workers, who then take a case. They go to the WRC and say that the company, which gets money from the State, from the Irish Film Board and under section 481, had set up a DAC and employed them on multiple productions and, therefore, they are asserting their rights under law to, for example, a contract of indefinite duration. The company that gets the money from the Government for quality employment and training will say that they are not its employees, even though it knows them, and even though it set up all of the subsidiaries, which are wholly-owned subsidiaries of the company that gets the money for quality employment and training. It hides behind that DAC and says they are not its employees, even though they may have worked for the company for ten, 12 or 15 years. The company goes in and signs sworn affidavits to that effect.",
                "At the WRC recently, a case was taken by stagehands, who won by establishing that the company cannot hide behind the DAC. The film producer company then went to the Labour Court to try to overturn that decision, and it succeeded. The stagehands then went to the High Court, which very recently made a ruling that said what the Labour Court had decided was ridiculous because it simply took the producer company’s word that these people were not its employees, and it never looked further into it, when, clearly, the producer company was the company that got the money from the State. Reference was made in the High Court ruling to the moneys received from the State as proof that the producer company that was denying the employment relationship is the recipient of an incentive from the State.",
                "The State is involved here. I do not understand why the State would not clarify this issue. This has been going on for years, and multiple cases have been taken. The State could just step in and say that this is what it means when it gives the money, and that it is going to clarify that, in law and in legislation, this is what it means by quality employment and training. It means that the company the State gives the money to cannot hide behind a pop-up shop that it sets up when it is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the entity that the State gives the money to. That is what I am asking. While the amendment has been ruled out of order, I would still ask the Minister to seriously consider it, although not for this Bill, because that is not going to happen.",
                "By the same token, for the performers, writers, directors and others, their gripe also revolves around the DAC. If they want to work on a film and the producer has set up a DAC to do it, they are handed a contract to work on that film, and that contract states that they will sign away their right to future royalties to the DAC. In the past, actors, writers and performers would have received residuals - royalty payments - if the particular production turned out to be successful and did really well. However, the producer companies do not want to give the intellectual property rights to a share of future royalties. Instead, they want to say that they are giving the equitable remuneration that is required upfront. For the Minister to understand this, there is no way the producer company can say it is equitable remuneration upfront. How could it? It does not know how the film is going to do. It does not know if it is going to be played again and again or be a big success, and, therefore, be put out all over the world, on Netflix and the streamers, and be played in a lot of cinemas. How successful it is will determine how much money the film makes. However, if the actors are told they have to agree upfront to sign away their rights, and the company is going to pay them so much now, they lose out on all that downstream stuff.",
                "Again, and this is a technical point, the rights for that film are signed over to the DAC. Where do those rights go after the DAC is wound up?",
                "Who do they go to? As far as I know, nobody really knows. I bet the producer company the Government gives the money to knows, and its beneficiary."

Equity has been campaigning on this and is asking for contracts similar to the PACT Equity in the UK, where there are superior contracts. Often, a guff answer is given back by the producers, that the PACT Equity contract is an English agreement and not suitable to Ireland. That is just nonsense. This is what the actors want here. The actors, writers and performers are getting inferior contracts to their counterparts in Britain. Give them the proper contracts and end the use of buy-out contracts. End the situation where the producers the Government is giving money to are essentially blackmailing writers, performers and actors into signing buy-out contracts, because if they do not sign them, they do not get work. The net result of all of this is, if you do not do what the producers tell you, you do not get on the film, whether you are a member of crew, a performer or whatever. You are just blacklisted out of the industry, branded a troublemaker and do not get back in. The \"You're never going to work in this town\" stuff has to end.",

In the case I went to see, two stage hands were faced with all of those people. How are they supposed to deal with all of them?

                "I have already put some of this on the record, so I will not delay proceedings. We are dealing with film, which is an important industry in Ireland and we need to treat it as such. What we have done over the years, despite criticism, is to create, or recreate, a film industry that we hope will stand the test of time. In doing so, we have forgone a lot of tax revenue, which is what tax relief is. We have invested in the Irish Film Board and are today allowing it to expend more on projects. I do not think anybody has a problem with that purpose. Most of us have seen at least some of the fruits of the investment in recent years and have also seen the potential for further growth. That is why it is to the benefit of the Irish Film Board and the industry as a whole that we further invest and try to bed down where we have got to, continue to try to keep up with an ever-changing market, and identify the threats coming from AI and from other jurisdictions, including our nearest one, which has changed tax policies as well to try to reap some of the rewards.",
                "In doing all of that, we also have to be mindful of problems that have been raised over time, not only outside of here but also in this House. Some of them can be addressed quite quickly and some of them are being addressed. It is not every single film company, DAC or producer that is trying to gain some advantage by abusing workers' rights, including their right to proper remuneration. That is why the message needs to go out. I will use this opportunity to try to ensure that the message goes out from us, who are setting the law, that you are not allowed to breach the EU copyright directive, you are not allowed to chance your arm. That message does not seem to always be heard - that you are not allowed to blacklist workers, you are not allowed to withhold funding, and you are not allowed to join the race to the bottom. At the end of the day, we want an industry that we are proud of, pays people well, and ensures they are employed and can take home not just the enjoyment they have from being involved in a film, but wages to pay the bills, especially as we face into crisis after crisis in terms of people's ability to have a disposable income.",
                "That is why I have raised these issues over the years. I have also raised the issue of the regional uplift - the Gaeltacht uplift - and ensuring that we use the opportunity of giving tax relief so that more of the artistic endeavours of others in Ireland benefit from it. We have some of the best composers in the world, yet there are film companies, DACs, producers and others who are behind the films importing music or importing composers to come to Ireland to compose rather than us making sure that, in our cultural test for the section 481 relief, the best comes out.",
                "Having said all of that, we are not as bad as we were ten years ago. There is an acknowledgement of the changes the Minister and others before him have made. Some of that is because, in fairness to people in this House, people get up and raise the issues. We have had the support of those involved in the industry. They have told us the truth and explained to us how the film industry works. That is why we supported the tax relief for the unscripted programmes and the additional funding for animation. I hope little things like those will continue to happen to address shortfalls or problems that emerge.",
                "The European copyright directive was set in train, and I would have gone further than it, but at the very least should be used as a yardstick by which people's rights are not undermined and are not bought off them in the way they have been over the years, where people end up with no benefit whatsoever. Their work and identities are continuously used to make further and further profits for those who are behind this.",

They state explicitly that there are numerous examples of blackballing, that is, if somebody is not particularly happy with conditions even after having worked for that production company for many years on many different productions, the designated activity company is created and the head of department, HOD, on the new production makes the call as to who is going to be on set. The determination can quite easily be made that, if someone is trying to vindicate their rights, they do not get the call. If this were any other industry, that situation would not arise. It is an outlier industry in that sense, and everything is one production at a time and the protections are not necessarily there. We have also seen an erosion of conditions and even the paying of expenses that occurred previously but now does not occur.",

It does not make any sense for those involved, be it in writing or in creativity in general, if, following their works, they do not get the benefit of those works into the future through the payment of residuals. Last week, I asked whether anyone could imagine if Mariah Carey was not getting her residuals for a particular Christmas song or if George Michael, or, I should say, George Michael's estate at this stage, was not. With any major film, we think of the writers and the actors. Do we think that nobody would have bought into the idea of residuals? The fact is we are talking about a scenario where someone is basically being given an offer they cannot refuse to sign over those residuals.",

We need to ensure that we do the due diligence and we set up the framework because when we used ask these questions previously, we were told there would be a stakeholder forum, which there was, and that the outworkings of that would be that we would deal with these issues. That has not happened. The issue was brought up with the Tánaiste, who is the new Minister for Finance. Deputy Ó Snodaigh pulled his amendment on the basis that this would be an issue that would be looked at. That is something that needs to be dealt with because we cannot have it be the case that people cannot vindicate their rights, for instance, under the EU working time directive.",
                "We have heard of multiple instances where conditions have got worse and the capacity and ability to deal with these are not there because of the outlier circumstances that exist in this particular industry. That is not to say there are not good producers producing good content and ensuring that they are providing their workers with rights but that is not the case across the board.",
                "A huge amount of this has been gone through over and back, because we are constantly told about the industrial relations infrastructure. In fairness, the case that Deputy Boyd Barrett spoke about was a case where the High Court hammered the decision of the Labour Court and vindicated these people's rights by stating that, forget the ins and outs of DACs, they were employees of this production company. That is the shooting match.",
                "We need to make sure. I am asking the Government, as it has the capacity to answer these questions, to use whatever means. None of us is particularly worried about what the means of enforcement are because we constantly get told that it should not happen through finances or taxation, as those are not the means by which you ensure that people's rights are vindicated. However, there are cultural tests and other tests in relation to section 481. It is fair enough that we have a proper system that allows for the testing of these particular issues where people's rights are not vindicated.",

                "Alongside blackballing, while everybody welcomes the idea of training within an industry, we are being told constantly that there has been a reduction in the number of professionals engaged in productions and that the number of trainees has increased. I understand the issue in relation to those trainees. They are looking to get into the industry. They are probably willing to go above and beyond and sometimes they will accept conditions that somebody who has worked previously for a company would not. It is obvious you are not going to accept less pay, longer worker hours or whatever the particular conditions are for no good reason. I would ask that we find a means of looking at this. I heard recently of an issue of a particular crew member trainee who was very happy to get the job, but whereas companies would previously have paid for accommodation or at least paid rates that covered it, that was not the case in this instance. We have heard of cases of people who, to ensure that they are getting work and to ensure that they are getting into the industry, are sleeping in their cars. That means we have an unsustainable system. I am not only looking at it from the point of view of a test on whether blackballing happens. We need to look into the ins and outs of how things have changed and the number of trainees versus the number of professional crew that are on particular productions.",
                "We have to look at how conditions have changed over the years and we have to find a means by which we can ensure that people can access whatever resources they need from the point of view of vindicating their rights because, as we have explained, this is a very different industry and the producer and the employer have the means of hiding behind the DAC. The DAC is set up for every individual project. That may be for a film shoot. The DAC is set up and the producer takes down the money. We as the State provide the tax breaks, they get the money and then the DAC is created. The DAC technically employs people, but it is the producer. It is only a means by which they carry out each individual operation or television or film production. Afterwards, it disappears. Where do the rights and everything else go? When people have, under pressure, signed over residuals, when the DAC disappears, that right, the means and the ability to take down funding and take down those residuals still lie with the producer.",
                "None of this is suitable in any way.",
                "It has also been pointed to me that Screen Skills Ireland, a division of Screen Ireland, has been busy appointing trainees to film productions. It is a fair question, if it has the power to appoint trainees to productions, why it cannot appoint professionals as well? I get that we come into the Chamber and we repeat ourselves, whether on housing or healthcare. We almost have single transferable speeches. If anyone goes through the record, they will see the exact same points having been stated. We all want a thriving film industry that is sustainable. For that to happen, it must be ensured that people have their rights. We cannot have those in the industry, who are risking the industry, not providing those rights, hiding behind the technicality of the DAC and, beyond that, forcing those who expended creativity and did huge work to hand over the rights to that into the future. None of that is fair or correct. It will impact into the future in relation to a sustainable industry. We have all heard of reshoots happening, sometimes outside of Ireland, and one reason I was given was that there were productions with too many trainees, without those who had worked previously and been involved in many successful productions. Particular issues arose. There are protections for the employer, the producer, which do not exist for the employee and which exist in other industries, even in the gaming industry, which section 481 provides benefits to. Those who work for gaming companies are in a far better situation and have more protections than those in the film industry or those who have been blackballed and have not been able to work in the film industry."

It is important to point out that the aggregate relates to the amount of money expended since 1980, a 45-year term. It is not that we are hoping to spend this money into the future; it is an aggregate. It is an issue that comes up with a lot of State agencies. It is clunky that they have to keep coming back to the Minister of the day to amend legislation. In this case, it is the Irish Film Board Act 1980. I agree with Deputy Ó Snodaigh and I have plans to bring forward a Screen Ireland Bill at some stage in 2026 to take account of the fact that Screen Ireland bears no relation to what the Irish Film Board was like in 1980. Ireland is a totally different place now. Touching on what Deputy Ó Murchú said with regard to gaming, I will also include in the Bill specific references to gaming and animation.",

Those avenues are available to people.",

If there have been issues raised, and I know these are firmly held views both Deputy Ó Snodaigh and Deputy Boyd Barrett have because I would have dealt with them previously on these issues and I do not for one minute discount them, but I know Screen Producers Ireland will take them into consideration. I will draw them to its attention when I meet it next. Organisations representing performers, writers, directors and composers have agreed with producers and published industry interim guidelines for producers, authors and performers in the Irish screen industry. These guidelines cover fair remuneration for them. That is important to put on the record.",
                "Both amendments were ruled out of order. A lot of latitude has been provided. I do not propose to speak to the amendments other than to say it is my intention to bring a Bill before the House in 2026. This Bill before us is a technical and specific Bill around the aggregate amount of money. I will also be before the committee after Christmas. Deputy Ó Snodaigh and others know I am of a mind, when members of the Opposition bring up issues, to take them on board. I have routinely done that and will again in the future. I look forward to working with the committee after Christmas on that Bill and on the general issue with regard to Screen Ireland and the production of film in Ireland."

                "With the money we are investing, is it not worrying that, at the end of it, we have nothing? It is not just section 481. There was a slight batting off of the thing and saying this is section 481, and I understand this is the film board, although the idea that these two things are completely separate is a bit ridiculous. They both go to the same film producer companies. Every single film produced here gets money off the film board and gets money off section 481. The combination of State moneys is a significant fact. The films would not happen without that money. It comes from two arms of the State, but it is said this bit is not our responsibility and workers' rights are the responsibility of Department of trade and enterprise, apparently, so there are three Ministries and everybody is batting it off to everybody else.",
                "I would like a response to the following at some point, if the Minister cannot give it now. Am I not right in saying that EU directives on state aid to the audiovisual industry, which includes money from the film board, say it is conditional on meeting industry tests? Those tests require the building up of permanent pools of skills and companies of scale. Where are the companies of scale? They cannot be companies of scale if they say they have no employees. The biggest companies in this country have tiny numbers of admin people. One, which has been in receipt of large amounts of money, recently sold a majority share off to another big international company, Element. After all that money we have poured in to create a company that still does not really have any scale but is one of the biggest we have, it has now sold, and I presume and am guessing pretty pennies were made there, although I do not know the exact figures on it. Specifically for the film board, does the Minister know what the recoupment rate is on that money? The aggregate, loans and grants over that period are just under €500 million, mostly in loans.",
                "Does the Minister know how much we got back? Over time, the amount will go up to €800 million. Most of the arrangements are categorised as loans and the main recipients are the film producer companies I mentioned. There are about four that get most of the money. I understand that not every film will make money. In fact, in many cases we want to give money for productions that will not make money. I back that but the biggest recipients make money. We hear on the news all the time that they have got this or that award, so they must be making money. However, we do not get any of it back, even though we have given the recipients loans. Do we know what the recoupment rate is?",
                "One of the film workers' representative groups, most of which have been blacklisted out of the industry and are fighting cases in the Labour Court and so on, produced a report a few years ago showing that, at that stage, loans totalling €176 million had been given and that the recoupment rate was €12 million, or less than 10%. The aggregate figure is now up to just under €500 million. If the recoupment rate is roughly the same as I have suggested, it is very low. I am not suggesting that every film has to make a profit. An Irish Equity representative said the most creative thing in the Irish film industry is the accountancy. It is a good line, is it not? The point he was making, which needs to be considered, is that the way we have managed to structure the industry is such that films are set up so that on paper they never make a profit. If they made a profit, they could have to pay somebody back or pay some tax, so they are set up in such a way that they never make a profit. I sharply distinguish between these and the small, genuine filmmakers who are inevitably not going to make money and struggle to get film productions off the ground. I am not talking about them. They need every bit of support they can get. I am referring to the big guys, who are clearly successful, and to where there are royalties that could be given to the actors. We do not know where the royalties go because actors are forced to sign buy-out contracts. These things need to be looked into.",
                "I hope we and the Minister present will work in a joined-up way with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Employment to stop the game of saying various things are the responsibility of various others. I honestly believe that under the EU directive, we are required to ensure the net result is a serious industry in which people have some security of employment and in which actors, writers and performers get proper remuneration, which they are not getting currently. I will leave it at that as I know we are running out of time, but I hope the Minister will seriously take the response on board."

It is worth watching if you want to see divilment in Cyril Cusack's eyes. It is absolutely brilliant. It was one of the first Irish-language films and it is worth watching. It is dated at this stage but shows that, even with very little money, what the Irish could do with imagination. We have seen that, and that is why I support this legislation and look forward to ensuring that, irrespective of the legislation that comes before the House on film and the arts, we try to get the best. Since Ireland is a small island, on the edge of the world in some ways, it has to invest in its artists. Artists, along with others, set us apart. We have seen this from the awards they have got. Whether it is the technical legislation before us or the forthcoming legislation, we have to ensure we get it right. Others are getting their act together, have seen the success here and want a piece of the cake. They would probably have all of the cake if they could.

In this regard the Department has been quite successful over recent years. Now, at the end of 2025, the Department has begun discussions on the 2027 budget. We have already started to examine the matter.",

I am aware that Deputy Boyd Barrett's party is called People Before Profit but I do not believe there is anything wrong with films making a profit. The Deputy said we do not get anything back. The Government invests very heavily in culture, authors, literature and musicians but does not expect to own the copyright of the books. The investment in the film industry is an investment in the country as well.",

You cannot buy the type of exposure that we are getting internationally for this. It is a lot of money, but in the scheme of things, based on what all Deputies, including Deputy Boyd Barrett, have said about the successes of Irish film over the last number of years, it is a relatively small amount of money that I want to grow. I am looking forward to working with the Opposition throughout 2026 in what I hope will be a year in which I will be able to bring forward a new Bill, the Screen Ireland Bill."

Nobody is suggesting it should be, but there could be a significantly greater level of security and there could be a situation where it is not wide open for people to be victimised.

You get the phone call or you do not get the phone call. There is no protection against not getting a phone call. That should stop. Similarly, there is no protection against actors, writers and performers having a contract put in front of them and being told to sign that or see you later. That should not happen."

This is required so that I can introduce Government amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage. The proposed amendments to the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2020 follow on from the general scheme, approved by Government on 30 January 2024, pre-legislative scrutiny that took place on 23 April 2024, and the advice of the Attorney General, and further reflects the decision made by Government on 2 December 2025 to proceed as part of the Remediation of Dwellings Damaged by the Use of Defective Concrete Blocks (Amendment) Bill 2025. On Second Stage of the Bill, on 2 December, I signalled my intention to bring forward a number of amendments to the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2020.",
                "By way of background, the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2020 provide for the regulation of the design and construction of buildings in order to ensure the safety, health and welfare of people within the built environment. The Acts provide for the making of building regulations and building control regulations and set out the legislative basis for the system of enforcement. The main objective of the amendments is to underpin, extend and strengthen the system of building control enforcement to support compliance with the building regulations. The main provisions of the amendments are contained in a new Part 3 of the Bill.",
                "I draw the House's attention to the key changes and main provisions of the amendments to the Building Control Acts in the Bill. Section 29 contains provisions dealing with definitions. Section 30 amends section 3 of the Building Control Acts and introduces an additional power, for which the Minister may make building regulations. It facilitates the provision of information in respect of systems installed in a building in order to provide the end user with the information necessary to support the efficient and effective operation and use of the building after completion.",
                "Section 31 amends section 6, building control regulations, of the Building Control Acts and provides explicit powers for the Minister to prevent a building being opened, operated or occupied until such a time as the particulars of the relevant certificate of compliance on completion have been entered on the register maintained by the building control authority, where such a document is required by regulation. This underpins the strengthening of building control regulations in 2014, introduced in response to the then emerging defects in construction. This section also provides for a regularisation process for the uncommon situation whereby works which have commenced or been completed in respect of a building without submitting, by either act or omission, an appropriate valid notice to the building control authorities in certain circumstances. The regularisation process will be detailed in the new building control regulations and will only facilitate works that are in compliance with the building regulations.",
                "Separately, this section also amends the names of certain building control certificates issued under the Building Control Acts to better reflect their purpose. For example the section changes fire safety certificates to fire safety design certificates and disability access certificates to access and use design certificates. The changes also introduce a process for the application for a regularisation fire safety design certificate to replace the currently named regularisation certificate.",
                "Section 32 makes transitional provisions in relation to the renaming of certificates. Section 33 amends section 7 of the Building Control Acts to provide for the appeal of a decision of a building control authority on an application for a regularisation fire safety design certificate and other consequential amendments. Section 34 amends section 8, enforcement notice, of the Building Control Acts to provide a building control authority with the power to require the owner or occupier of a building, or any person responsible for the construction of a building, to open up construction works, as may be reasonable in certain circumstances, to be able to ascertain that the relevant requirements of the building regulations in respect of the works have been complied with.",
                "Section 35 amends section 10 of the Building Control Acts by the insertion of a new section providing, for the first time, for the withdrawal of an enforcement notice. This amendment provides an administrative procedure consistent with the principles of natural justice while maintaining strong powers of enforcement. This section further amends section 10 of the Building Control Acts by the insertion of a second new section providing the Minister with regulation-making powers relating to enforcement notices. Section 36 amends section 11 of the Building Control Acts to provide authorised officers of building control authorities with the power to issue a warning letter in respect of compliance with the building regulations and-or building control regulations following on from an inspection they had carried out.",
                "Section 37 amends section 12 of the Building Control Acts to provide the power to a building control authority to make an application to the High Court or to the Circuit Court for an order restricting or prohibiting the use of the building where a certificate of compliance on completion or regularisation certificate of compliance on completion is required, but has not been submitted to the building control authority and placed on the register. Sections 38 and 39 amend references to a fire safety certificate in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011.",

I have outlined in detail the proposed amendments to the Building Control Acts and it is clear that these proposed changes will bring about an improved regulatory environment for the benefit of all stakeholders. I ask for the support of Members of the House for the motion to enable these important amendments to be tabled. I will seek to respond to any specific questions and engage further on Committee Stage."

                "I thank the Minister for his opening remarks. This is an entirely unacceptable way to introduce significant legislative changes to the Building Control Acts. Building control may not be a matter of huge media or public interest but it is absolutely essential to the well-being of people in their homes.",
                "We know that because we are currently dealing with the general scheme of the legislation to introduce a redress scheme for the thousands, if not tens of thousands, of homeowners and tenants impacted by building defects, a redress scheme that will cost the State a minimum of €2.5 billion over a decade, but probably much more. Yet, here we are in the final days of an Oireachtas term and a ten-page Bill - these are not amendments; this is stand-alone legislation - is being rammed through in the space, effectively, of an hour with no Oireachtas scrutiny whatsoever. There will not be any opportunity for our committee to engage with the Minister or his officials in public session. There will be no opportunity for our committee to listen to experts on the front line in the National Building Control Office or building control authorities, or indeed for us to undertake the necessary scrutiny of such important legislation.",
                "To thank us for our collaboration is gaslighting; let us be honest. Until last Thursday's Second Stage debate on the Bill, none of us had any notion that this was coming in, this side of Christmas. I accept it was in the legislative programme and pre-legislative scrutiny was done over at a year ago, but to throw this in in this way is entirely unacceptable.",
                "What has actually happened? The limited information we have is that the Government is acting under pressure from court decisions and imminent court proceedings. In order to fix a number of problems identified by building control officials this is being processed in the manner that it is. While the issue at hand is not the intention behind these changes and while there has always been a cross-party willingness across the Opposition and the Government to work together to strengthen our building control system in the decade that I have been in this House, this is not a smart way to proceed. We know this because we have been here before. We had a similar issue with a similar regularisation process, called substitute consent, a number of years ago where very significant legal challenges put pressure on the Government to put pressure on officials to introduce substantial legislation in a similar form to this and in a similar manner to this. Because of the way in which it was done, in the absence of scrutiny and the absence of time, the Government got the legislation wrong and amending legislation had to be brought forward the following December. I am hoping that will not be the case this time, but we just do not know because we have not been afforded the opportunity to do our job of scrutinising this process.",
                "I fully understand, from talking to building control officials, that much of what is in this Bill has either been requested by people on the front line or arises out of acknowledgement of weaknesses in the underlying legislation. I want to make clear that my criticisms are not in any way of the departmental officials who have been working on this legislation. This is a political charge against the Government for treating the Oireachtas housing committee and the wider Oireachtas with utter disrespect as regards our important role in scrutinising legislation.",
                "I am particularly concerned that there is a very real possibility that the regularisation process will be got wrong and it will allow a small but growing number of rogue developers, who are already in substantial non-compliance of planning and building control requirements, to further game the system to allow themselves to evade full compliance, while all the time making enormous profits by charging tenants exceptionally high rents. I say that because I have a lot of experience, both in my constituency and elsewhere, of such developments, including Larkfield House on Coldcut Road and Chianti Park in Brittas. As both developments are before the courts, I will not comment on them. They are both well-documented cases of well-known rogue developers in breach of planning and building control requirements, and then utilising the weakness of existing regularisation procedures in planning to stretch out their non-compliance for years in some cases, while all the time buildings are fully occupied with people paying rent of between €2,000 and €3,000 a month, much of which is subsidised by the State through the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme.",
                "Those rogue developers have a business model. That business model is to break all of our planning and building control rules, then fight it out through retention in planning permission and then fight it out in the courts, by which time the buildings are occupied and it becomes very difficult for a local authority, in the middle of a housing crisis, to have to force the evacuation of these buildings and the eviction of large numbers of families. That is the way these people operate. We have not had an adequate opportunity to assure ourselves that they will not be able to do the same with this process. I know that is not the intention of the departmental officials, and that is not a charge I am laying against them. I know they will have done everything they can to ensure this legislation is correct. However, the whole point of having committee scrutiny and having the opportunity to bring in third parties and people at the front line is to further scrutinise the legislation to make sure it is correct.",
                "I raised a concern in the briefing that we were not offered but had to request. I am very grateful to the officials for giving us their time today. I am particularly concerned with section 8(b)(4A) and the interaction of the requirement for authorised personnel from building control sections to inspect as part of the enforcement for the regularisation procedure. I am not against the idea in principle but I am concerned that those local authorities that take a more cautious and conservative approach to building control may actually interpret this section of the Bill in an unintended manner which would actually reduce the level of enforcement of building control. I urge the Minister to relook at that.",
                "I have been here too long to accept this way of doing business and I will not support this motion. That does not mean I do not support genuine attempts to improve building control but I will not be party to shoddily produced and rushed legislation. While I know he will not do it, I urge the Minister to withdraw the amendments and deal with them properly through committee. In the absence of that, I urge him to give us a commitment that the regulations arising from these amendments will be discussed in draft form with the committee so that we will have the opportunity to bring in third parties like the National Building Control Office and building control authorities to give their views on that to ensure we do not have a repeat of any of the kinds of defective developments that are currently taking place, not those pre-2014 but those post BCAR, because it is not working appropriately."

In the short time that I have been here, I have witnessed the Minister and his Department do things like this at the last minute, railroad them through without giving us, as Oireachtas Members, enough time to properly consider what the implications of these changes are. This is an entirely inappropriate way of doing what the Minister is trying to do. We had a briefing this afternoon. I am very grateful to the departmental officials for giving us that briefing at 3 p.m. because before 3 o'clock today, I was tearing my hair out on this. Tonight, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael TDs will come in here, sit at their seats and push the button to vote for this, but they will not have a foggy notion what they are voting on.",

It is always the taxpayer who has to foot the bill for that. It is the taxpayer who will have to pay billions to remedy the apartment defects. We know the Minister is doing this because he essentially has to do it arising from the legal issues and the impending and existing court decisions.",

We are being asked tonight to sign off on something when we have not had detailed consideration of what has been proposed. We need to completely break the link between developers and the inspection process because the inspection process is not robust enough. This Bill was originally supposed to be about defective concrete, and that is what its primary function relates to. We have a motion to instruct tonight because we have a Bill that has literally been morphed into something entirely different.",
                "We should have had a revised explanatory memorandum for the entire Bill because these amendments are way outside the scope of the original Bill, which deals with defective concrete. We know we need to move on this, but this is not the correct way to go about it. I do not have sufficient clarity from what I have seen so far that this regularisation process is not going to be open to abuse from a minority, even though that is not the intention or practically how it will function.",
                "I was a bit concerned when we had the briefing earlier on and I found out that local authorities have not been consulted yet on this because we know local authorities have huge issues when it comes to staffing and resources which impacts in some cases their ability to carry out this work. We have issues which stem originally from the 1990 Act which places the primary responsibility on the builders and designers, and we have a culture there of non-compliance. We have had very few convictions under this and we have widespread issues. We are going through it in detail at the moment in relation to the defective apartments.",
                "While I understand why the Department is keen to take action on this, and I support the call for stronger building control, I cannot support this Bill this evening because I have not had sight of even a summary of any of the legal advice or any of the advice received from the Attorney General on this. While some of the measures are technical, there are more substantial changes to other sections of the Bill. It was a bad decision by Government to progress this in the manner it has. I do not have an issue in principle with the premise of stronger building regulation, but I have a huge issue with the rushed manner in which the Government is doing this. We know rushed legislation makes for bad legislation. I urge the Government to withdraw these amendments and come back in the new year with a stand-alone piece of legislation so we can actually tease these issues out properly. We really need to discuss this at committee level. We need to hear from relevant building control witnesses because this is too serious to get wrong. We have been here before regarding shoddy building standards and we are all paying the price for it. When we talk on the original premise of the Bill in relation to defective concrete, notwithstanding the huge emotional, psychological and physical effect it is having on the people affected, I am very conscious that it is all of us who are paying for those mistakes through that culture of non-compliance and through the levy on concrete. In principle, the Minister is effectively guillotining this legislation and he is effectively guillotining our ability to have a meaningful impact on it and go through the actual cause and effect of what the Government is proposing. The Minister really needs to rethink this."

It is wonderful to have them in and it is interesting because it makes me reflect on this. I have looked at it and I am concerned, as others have expressed, by its rushed nature and the fact that we have not been given the time to go through it in detail. It connects with young people coming in to understand and see our democracy and politics in action and the decisions made. Unfortunately, the measures brought forward in this Bill and the rushed nature of the amendments and what has been done are not the true actions of what a democracy should be. The Opposition should be given the time to go through and understand these measures and amendments. I know the Minister has a legal background. I do not think he would consider it fair to be thrown into a court and be expected to make decisions without all the evidence and advice to hand. In a way he is asking us to do the same - to make decisions on important, fundamental legislation without having all the information or advice, including the advice from the Attorney General, to hand. We should have it. If we are to take our jobs as legislators seriously then we have to raise these concerns and ask whether we are making decisions in full knowledge with all the information we should have. The reality is the Minister knows we are not and we would not be. On that basis, we cannot stand over supporting what the Minister is bringing forward on this Stage.",
                "As Deputy Charles Ward and all of us on this side of the House have raised, the issues affecting the people of Donegal, Mayo and other counties along the west coast that have been affected by defective concrete blocks, as well as the issues affecting those in our own constituencies who have been affected by the apartment dwelling issues and the serious issues we have raised in respect of fire safety and the potential risks to life that are ongoing because of defective building, are matters of life and death. These are matters that determine the ability of people to live in homes that are safe, secure and of a decent standard. There are serious concerns. The Minister has said his intention with this is to improve things. That is his intention and that of his officials and I take that at face value. However, we need to be able to see that in detail to be able to support it. We know there are major problems with building standards and the concern is how we are going to ensure that is not going to continue. In Ballymun, in my constituency, we have social housing that was built not 40 years ago, but in the time of the regeneration two decades ago, and yet there are major problems of dampness and mould and these need to be addressed. We need to be assured that we are avoiding this happening in the future and that the problems that exist are going to be rectified properly. On that basis, the Social Democrats will not be supporting the motion."

Within weeks of moving into her forever home, she discovered the roof was too heavy and the walls were buckling. For 18 years, she has been in and out of court fighting to hold onto her home. Today she has negotiated with a vulture fund to keep a roof over her head. In order to make her home structurally sound, she faces costs of between €150,000 to €200,000.

                "I will make the speech I was not allowed to make earlier and I will not be muzzled. I will talk about defective concrete. Today's Bill should have been an opportunity to correct the fundamentally broken system. Instead, we are laying more complexity on top of injustice and calling it progress. I have submitted 18 pages of amendments to improve this scheme, yet more than half of those amendments were ruled out of order, including my amendment regarding the March cut-off date that I had chosen. With that, the Government is leaving 43 homeowners behind because it has chosen to abandon them. My amendment would provide interim arrangements regarding the provision of IS 465, with scientific evidence reinstating the original engineers' determinations.",
                "Families, the purpose of modular homes, which is ultimately to save the State money, and ancillary payments were included. Partial defective builds before the cut-off date are still defective builds. Homeowners have been left behind. They have built their homes but their homes have crumbled and now they are left in debt through no fault of their own, but through the Government’s failure in regulation. The provision of upfront payments to allow people without necessary money to access the scheme, again at no cost to the State, was refused. My amendment to establish a public inquiry into the regulatory failures of this multibillion euro scheme was denied again, as well as many other extremities and amendments. The Government's amendments reveal the real problem we have, that is, we have not learned a single thing from the defective concrete crisis.",
                "Damage does not always look like damage. Legislation could have prevented this, but with flawed understanding, the deterioration will continue and the scheme will be flawed.",
                "There is one positive thing. A semi-detached house is now treated as one unit, so if one house does not meet the damage threshold, then the other can be deemed so. However, this is nothing more than a get-out-of-jail card as far as I am concerned. It relies on visual assessment. This is a blunt instrument that applies to all homes. The threshold does not measure structural integrity. The threshold measures visible cracking. Walls, however, are disintegrating behind plaster. You can knock the plaster and get nothing but dust. Walls are there to protect families, but in defective concrete homes, they do not protect families. They will end up killing families if we do not do something about it. Homes may not meet the threshold today but they will meet a catastrophic threshold in the years to come. The Minister provides no mechanism to allow us to move on, as far as I am concerned.",
                "Adjacent remediation is welcome in principle but the Bill restricts it to dwelling adaptation. Basically, if a person with a disability has to move on, that is okay as long as the disability is visible. This excludes children and adults with hidden disabilities, including autism, ADHD, chronic illness and mental health conditions. Under the Disability Act, these individuals are entitled to protection and accommodation but they are not getting it. They are not getting the same treatment as everybody else. I feel they are being discriminated against and I think everybody else will feel this, too, by the time I am finished.",
                "Allowing homeowners to remain on site with space on their sites would save the Exchequer money. It would allow people with a disabled child, for example, to move from one house into a new build that is kitted out for them. They can move into their build and it is at no cost to the State. We do not need to put pressure on the rental market because we have 25,000-plus homes affected in Donegal. If we were to move the people in 2,000 homes tomorrow, we would not be able to do it because we do not have the capacity. The Government will not look at modular homes but it must. If the Minister wants to do this properly, he needs to listen to the people on the ground and to the people who have done this and who have been fighting for them instead of following what the rest of the Government is saying to him. I am telling the Minister now that if he does not look at this in the correct manner, then what will follow will be a humanitarian disaster all over Ireland. It is already a humanitarian disaster in Donegal.",
                "Families with hidden disabilities and children with special needs endure overcrowding or sensory overload when they move to different accommodation. Can the Minister imagine if a child with autism, who has a certain way of living his or her life and perhaps has ADHD, is taken out of his or her home? A unit could have been built in another part of the garden. Leave them in their home and then let them move. As it is, that is not happening. We are having to move children to smaller places, with sensory overload, and even if they ever do recover, it will take them years. That is what we are here for. We are here to make sure that our citizens are treated equally but it is not happening.",
                "The proposed section 32 on transitional provisions are welcome because they ensure previous applications are not invalidated, but they do not address the symptomatic delays.",
                "The proposed Part 3, which amends the Building Control Act 1990, links defective concrete remediation to the national building standards. This is necessary for safety but we need to come in ahead.",
                "Voting down my amendment is voting against the people whom I represent. The people of Donegal have sent me up here. I was an ordinary working man who paid for his house. Tens of thousands of my people in Donegal, and people in Limerick, Clare and Mayo, are stuck. In the Minister's own constituency, they are stuck. It is going to be an epidemic if we do not do something about it. We have the opportunity to do it but if we do not do it, then we are going to abandon people and lives. It is bad enough that people in Donegal are treated like second class citizens, but for that to continue with their homes is unacceptable.",
                "I had a script for this speech but I am not going to stick to it. I am going to tell the Minister now that this has been going on 14 years. For 14 years, we have had failed housing Minister after failed housing Minister. It is about time that the Government took this seriously. What is happening in Donegal is also happening in Mayo, Limerick, Clare and Wexford. It is everywhere. It is happening in Kerry, Cork, you name it. There is a map out there and the only place it is not happening in is Antrim, but I am expecting a phone call any day. They know when they phone me that I will be there. I am always there and I always will be there. That is what I am saying."

One of the fundamental weaknesses of the original regulations and the former Minister, Darragh O'Brien's 2022 scheme is that they confine the issue of deleterious materials to block only.",

Hopefully, when the review of IS 465 is resolved, he will eventually realise that one of the many limitations - we will talk about those at great length throughout the course of the next four hours - of the scheme he is seeking to amend is that it is blind to instances where the deleterious material is in building materials other than block. This amendment, therefore, does not render the Short Title incomplete. It actually rectifies, albeit in the Title as opposed to the substance of the Bill, a significant limitation in the original scheme. This is going to have to change at some point. Obviously, it will not be now but it will change at some point."

There is much that we need to learn from what has happened and from what is going on. There is a real lack of accountability in the whole response that we have seen so far. It is very interesting. The Oireachtas Library and Research Service produced a briefing paper on the Bill. It is quite shocking to look at the tiny number of actual applications that were processed by the Housing Agency. There were over 2,500 applications but fewer than 1,000 were gone through. How many years is it now? We are 14 years in. When are we actually going to seriously address this? My concern is that, given what has been put forward, we will see more problems and the scheme not developed properly. I continue to be very concerned about it."

The same grit goes into block as goes into lintels, only it is a different sized chip. Lintels were 8 in. by 4 in., but now they are a regulated 8 in. by 8 in. even though it is the same material. It is just certified differently. It just uses a different sized chip, but it is the same stone. What goes into foundations also goes into the subfloor, the finished floor and the block work. It is the same stone. About the particles, the Minister might say that it covers the block only, but it is like baking a cake, using flour in one cake and saying that it is only down to that particular flour in that particular cake. It is the same flour. For every building material that may be used in a house, it is the same stone. The only thing that is different is the plastering, which is a sandstone. That is the difference. Everything else would be based off the different types of stone that are in the quarries. What I am trying to say to the Minister is that the amendment before the House seeks to remove \"Blocks\" only. If we were to interpret it through any law in the country, if a stone is a 6 mm chip, a 10 mm chip or a 20 mm chip, it is the same stone.",

We have it in the streets, in the houses, everywhere. There are nurseries in that county that are falling and the children cannot even go outside to play because the pathways are turning to dust. I keep saying it is only a matter of time. To use the word \"block\" is inaccurate. It is in the aggregate stone.

As the complexity of what we build increases, so does the need to understand the operation of the systems in order to ensure that buildings can be operated and maintained in accordance with the design intention.

Yet the Minister is able to say under those amendments that 1990 standards can be certified with 2025 standards. What has been made excessively clear tonight is that the Government will give the guarantee and take responsibility if there is a breakdown afterwards in the two different contexts of materials from the different eras."

                "2. Within 3 months of the passing of this Act the Minister shall lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas a report examining the gap between the actual cost of remediation for eligible homeowners and the grant provided under the scheme. The report shall set out recommendations for reform of the defective concrete block scheme to ensure that it provides 100 per cent redress to all impacted homeowners.”.",
                "The purpose of these three amendments is to give me and my colleagues an opportunity to highlight some of the challenges and weaknesses in the operation of the current scheme. While they are not addressed in the Minister's Bill, it is an opportunity for us to raise them. If they are not addressed at some point, hundreds, if not thousands, of homeowners and tenants will continue to be unable to access the scheme.",
                "It is important to reflect on where we are with the scheme. When the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, introduced the revised defective concrete blocks scheme very controversially in this House, railroading through the legislation and ignoring 80 homeowner-drafted amendments, we were told that the revised scheme would address the problems identified by affected homeowners and tenants in the affected counties. What is interesting is that when we look at the figures, the actual number of applicants to the revised scheme is less than the number of applicants to the original scheme. If the revised scheme were better, if the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, had succeeded in fixing the problems of the original scheme based on secondary legislation, there would have been more applications. The most up-to-date figures I have by way of parliamentary question show that there were 1,644 applicants to the original scheme up to the summer of this year, but only 1,152 to the enhanced scheme. We also know that because of many of the deficiencies in the transitional mechanisms between the original and the revised scheme, a very significant number of homeowners are stuck in limbo and unable to transition.",
                "The really startling figure relates to the total number of homes that have had work commenced on the property and the total number of homes where full remediation has taken place. Again, I am sure there is a slightly revised number that the Minister has available to him. Only 908 homes had commenced some level of work as of the summer of this year, and only 203 had been completely remediated. If we look at the estimates of the original expert group on defective concrete blocks, estimates that did not fully take into account, for example, social homes, additional private rental homes or non-residential buildings, what that tells us is that the scheme as it is currently in place is failing.",
                "Deputy Ward made clear from his contacts with his own constituents - my colleague, Deputy Pádraig Mac Lochlainn, will do the same - that the people who desperately need access to these schemes are simply not getting it. Why is that? Amendment No. 5 points to the single most important reason, which is that it is not a 100% redress scheme. The scheme does not cover the full cost of remediation or the full cost of all of the ancillary charges that homeowners or tenants have to face when remediation is taking place.",
                "Until the scheme addresses that fundamental deficit, it will not work. For example, I have spoken to homeowners who are currently getting their homes remediated in County Clare. These are modest-sized homes, one- and two-person bungalows. They have shortfalls in the region of €60,000. I am talking to families in Donegal who have slightly larger homes, but they are completely standard homes in that part of the country, and they are facing deficits of €100,000. What amendment No. 5 speaks to is the need for the Government to fully investigate the gap that is currently taking place between those folks who are remediating, what the grant provision is and what the actual costs to them are, and then bring forward proposals to address that. We have suggested proposals but we cannot table those amendments because they would place a charge on the State. This is, therefore, the only mechanism to do so.",
                "Amendment No. 6 deals with the other fundamental weakness of the scheme, which is that it is a grant-aid scheme. We all know the Leinster pyrite scheme was not a grant-aid scheme; it was an end-to-end scheme. It has worked exceptionally well, and one of the reasons it never gets debated in this House is that there are not complaints or problems with the primary purpose of the scheme. The reason is that the people in Leinster who were impacted by pyrite contacted the Housing Agency, which sent out competent professionals who inspected the property and agreed with the homeowners the work that needed to be done, and then, through a properly managed framework agreement, the Housing Agency employed the contractors to undertake the work. It is more efficient and cost-effective, and less stressful to the homeowners.",
                "Imagine being a pensioner in Inishowen who is on disability allowance and the Minister's proposition is that the pensioner has to project manage, procure and oversee the demolition and rebuilding of their home. It is a completely ludicrous proposition and we know, from talking to affected homeowners, that it has also led to a significant increase in prices being charged by building contractors and building materials suppliers. An end -to-end scheme is much more sensible. Again, we cannot propose an end-to-end scheme because it would be ruled out of order in accordance with Standing Orders. The purpose of this amendment is, therefore, to require the Minister to examine the merits of such a scheme and bring forward propositions to address it.",
                "The final amendment in this group, amendment No. 7, looks at the other barriers. There are some listed in the amendment but there are more beyond that. As regards the damage threshold, if we are serious about having a scheme that is based on the science, as other Deputies have said, it should not be based on a visual inspection but on the actual scientific evidence of the extent of sulphate attack in the deleterious material, based on engineers' reports and laboratory testing. Likewise, while some of what is now in this amendment is being addressed by way of amendments brought forward by the Minister, the continued absence of staged payments, for example, means that unless people have access to bridging finance or capital of their own, even with the offer of a grant, they may not have the capital to undertake the works and, therefore, will be unable to proceed with the remediation. Again, while we have solutions to that, we cannot table them because they would place a charge on the State. Therefore, we want the Minister to examine these issues in a timely manner, based on the real, lived experience of homeowners in Donegal, Mayo, Clare, Limerick and Sligo, and come back with recommendations to change them.",
                "To conclude on this grouping, if the Minister does not deal, during his term of office, with these fundamental flaws to both the original scheme and the revised scheme of the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, the scheme will continue to fail. Even with the partial increase in the grant cap for those who will be able to avail of it - there are exclusions and we will come to those on section 8 - without these more fundamental changes, raising the grant will not benefit the vast majority of people who are currently locked out, excluded or unable to utilise this scheme and they will continue to be left behind. This is an issue of equity and fairness. If people affected by pyrite in Leinster received 100% redress with an end-to-end scheme and appropriate ancillary grants, I can see no reason the Government can justify treating the people of Donegal, Mayo, Clare, Limerick, Sligo and other potentially impacted counties, including Fingal, as we discussed earlier, from exactly the same treatment. Right now, they are not getting equity, fairness or redress. For these reasons, we recommend all three of these amendments to ensure the Minister takes on the task of investigating coming up with credible solutions to problems that were identified back in 2022 when we tabled amendments to rectify those. The Minister's predecessor did not listen. We are hoping the Minister will listen on this occasion."

They are telling the Minister the scheme is fine, it is grand and he just needs to tinker around the edges, and that is what this legislation he has brought before the Houses is doing. Let me tell the Minister some home truths. The scheme works for a minority of people with an age profile probably in their 40s and 50s. They are people who can access €40,000, €50,000, €60,000, or maybe a bit more, and they may have family who are in the building game and they can project manage it. They have the energy to do it. It works for a minority of people who are willing and will say they will put €50,000, €60,000, €70,000 or €80,000 in. However, a large majority of the homeowners have a different age profile or just cannot afford the sum of money it would take.",
                "I have told the Minister a story and I will tell him it again because we have to humanise these things. Sometimes it is about statistics and data. I met a man at the site of his previous house, which had been demolished. All of his family memories were gone, packed into storage in the garage beside the house. As the Minister knows, garages are not included in this scheme. This man was traumatised. Then he told me about the choices he had to make when he went to the bank because the gap was huge. This is why I ask the Minister to please agree to amendment No. 4. The man had a mortgage with about six years left and, as I recall, the repayments were €900 per month. It is a great place to be in life, is it not? You are nearly there, having worked hard all of your life, which is the dream, and then maybe you can enjoy your retirement. That is what we all signed up for. He was told by his bank that the gap is almost €200,000. That is what he has to find and he is getting on with it. Does the Minister want to know what the mortgage repayment is now? It is €1,800, double what it was and it will be for 21 years. He will be still be paying his mortgage when he is a very old man. That is just pure cruelty and it is just one story. I could talk for the rest of the time allocated tonight about other stories.",
                "I ask the Minister to please listen to us. This is cruelty. The Minister rightly listened to the voices of pyrite campaigners in Dublin and north Leinster. They were tremendous campaigners. The Minister put in place a scheme and, as Deputy Ó Broin said, no one in here is complaining about that scheme. It is 100% redress and it is delivered by the State. The State takes responsibility for the project management, tendering and all of those engagements. Why on earth has the Minister been so cruel? Why have the officials in his Department been so cruel that they believe we have to have a different standard than the rest of the country? Why are our people tortured with bureaucracy and with having to find the amounts of money required?",
                "I will never forget the last time legislation on this came through this House in 2022. It was rammed through with no scrutiny. There was one day, thanks to the members of the committee who got the Bill, to discuss it. I think it was maybe for three or four hours. That was what was called \"scrutiny\" of a huge Bill. The campaigners up there in the Public Gallery were utterly traumatised. They were banging on the screens. They could not believe what they were seeing. I will never forget the look on their faces outside and in the days afterwards because they were absolutely betrayed.",

                "This is about equality for victims. When I have addressed parliamentary questions to the Minister and his predecessor, the senior officials write the responses. We know that. In the responses, the Minister says it is 100% redress based on the SCSI, costing. I will tell the Minister another home truth now. The Minister's predecessor, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, asked the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland to do a report on the costings in the regions affected. That report was requested in 2023 and the report was published in March 2024. Since then, which is pretty much two years, there has been a huge increase in costings. I had to have a protracted engagement with the Department, by the way. The Ceann Comhairle's office had to intervene to ensure I could squeeze the answer out of the Minister. The Minister has not asked SCSI to do fresh costings, and I know why. If the Minister does that, the logic will follow that he will have to put more money on the table and make the scheme worth more.",
                "I am convinced that the political advice given by the then Attorney General, Paul Gallagher, which is in the public domain, was about saving money. I am convinced that advice was that a scheme based on real science where houses were to be knocked down, and about equality between people all around Ireland who were victims, was not to be progressed.",

If he decides for political reasons tonight to press on with this as happened in 2022, I ask him as a human being to go away and reflect. If the Minister politically makes a decision to ram this through, not accept amendments and believe that his scheme is working, I ask him to reflect as a human being and to look in the mirror and ask himself if it is right to leave aside that man I told him about earlier who will be paying a double mortgage for the rest of his days, into his old age. How on earth is that 100% redress? How dare anybody write a reply to a parliamentary question for the Minister or come before an Oireachtas committee and tell us that is 100% redress?",

There are marriages destroyed, families destroyed, lives destroyed. All we are asking is that every victim have a real chance to rebuild their lives and for that to be managed by the State without distress. This involves it being project managed, the State dealing with the contractors and getting a fair price. This scheme, however, is designed to exclude people. Any public representative from Donegal who tells the Minister that this scheme is working is doing a huge disservice to our people. They did not listen to our people. They must only have friends who are wealthy because it is wrong.",

If your house is black with mould - we have seen the videos repeatedly - if the blocks are falling down and a danger to your family and children, or if you are in terror of the latest named storm that is coming along, that does not matter. You only need to have enough money in your pocket to make the scheme work.",

They ask him to stare the truth in the face and do what is right. That is what these amendments do and I am asking him, please, to not vote them down. He will be in that chair for a while and I will tell him something now. If he does what he did in 2022 and rams deficient legislation through again and does not listen to us, I can promise him that either he or the next person in his office will be here again because the Government will have to bring in legislation that is fair and just. This scheme is going to hit the rocks. People are going to be left behind. We will not stand for it and we will be back here again. Either the Minister does the right thing now or he, or the person who replace him, will come back and do the right thing in a year or two years. I will make the Minister that promise. When we are old men and we sit down together and reflect on our days in politics, the Minister will tell me I was right in what I have said here."

We know what works and we know what does not work. The end-to-end Fingal pyrite scheme has worked really well. It has been effective. It does not get talked about very much. Pyrite does not get talked about much any more here because when people access the scheme, the scheme is well managed by the Housing Agency, it is end-to-end and it does not place the responsibility on homeowners.",

There are issues that need to be addressed around mandatory foundation testing, eligibility criteria and retrospective payments. Some of my amendments were ruled out of order, in particular in relation to the arbitrary date of 29 March which makes absolutely no sense except from a cost saving point of view.",
                "To go back to a point others made earlier, this is being done to save the State money. That is why we have had this botched scheme, the revised scheme and now we have this Bill before us regarding the cap. We must also see legislative provision to hold to account those responsible for this. At the moment, every single one of us is paying for this because we all pay the concrete levy. Another important part of this amendment is extending the scheme to the rest of the country. Looking at the heat map, obviously there is a high concentration in Donegal, a concentration in Mayo and to a lesser degree in Limerick and Clare. The scale is completely under-reported. Many homeowners are extremely reluctant to come forward. Even the time it took to get Fingal onto the scheme - the bones of four years - shows it is crazy to continue along those lines.",

She is a significant part of the way through her mortgage. She realised her home was defective when she went to get the walls pumped as part of the SEAI grant, which exposed all the cracks. The issue now for this is woman is that she is €125,000 to €130,000 short. She has no way of coming up with that financing. She is dependent on one income and she has a mortgage to pay which is not insignificant. She is essentially stuck. We need industry accountability, retrospective payments and mandatory foundation testing. That is why, even if the Minister is pressing on with this, he must take on board the amendment and come back to us with a comprehensive piece of work in the next couple of months. Let us look at this in detail and in sincerity. As others have said, an end-to-end scheme would save the State money in the long run. We are going to be back here again, God help us, at some stage, tweaking this again because we will find uptake is low and the gap in costs widening. Construction inflation is growing and everything is going up in cost. Whatever headway is made from lifting the cap, it will be lost again and we will be back here again."

                "As other speakers said, this has not been costed since 2022. I will give the Minister a small few facts and it will not cost the State anything. I know the funds myself on a year-to-year basis for building costs. In 2021, the average cost of building a 2,000 sq. ft house was €120 per sq. ft on a greenfield site with a builder's finish. It cost €240,000 in 2021 with VAT of €32,400 on top that. In 2023, it was €180 per sq. ft. The same house went from €240,000 to €360,000 and the VAT was €48,600. In 2024, it was up to €200 per sq. ft - the same house with nothing extra. It cost €400,000 in 2024 and €54,000 VAT. If someone takes on a Government contract tomorrow morning, built into that contract, if the project goes over due to inflation over a certain percentage, is the adding on to the contract once the engineers can prove the material has moved. I said this in the Dáil last week and read out the letter, and it is ironic, that the same umbrella group from which the concrete products came - some, not all of its companies - sent a message through all their companies around Ireland that there would be an 8% increase in concrete products across the board. It was not one company saying it, it was the umbrella group sending it out through all its companies and the Government announced a 10% increase in the building. It has come out with 8% on concrete products alone. That is on top of what I am talking about here.",
                "I have been talking about greenfield sties. We now have to look at dismantling houses and getting rid of the material environmentally and with the proper certification. The costs are astronomical. Another €20 or €30 per sq. ft can be added to that and that is based on 2024 prices. We are talking about people who are short of money. A small thing that could go towards it, for the costing of the house, would be a VAT exemption. Why not? Based on 2024 prices, that would give them an extra €54,000 on a house towards the money they cannot raise. The Government could also, based on the Government doing its own contracts, fund it itself. The Government is going to give them the money in the first place, so why not fund it itself based on the engineers' reports? People would then not have to try to raise €200,000, €300,000 or €400,000 to rebuild a house or pay the VAT rate. Based on 2025 costings, taking in the remedial work that has to be done outside of the scope of works, the VAT is probably €70,000 based on a 2,000 sq. ft house. That €70,000 could go towards the rebuilding of their house if they get the costings. That would go some way to addressing inflation of costs.",
                "There is a 5% levy on all concrete products that was brought in. The same companies that were the problem announced an 8% increase this month. I am told it is coming in from 1 January. That same company in the past two years has given a 34% increase on all concrete products and the Government is charging a 5% levy on top of that. When will a regulation be put in place to tackle the elephant in the room? There are people who built their houses and got HomeBond and all these other certifications for their houses which are now falling down around them and the quarries that caused the problem are putting up their prices under an umbrella group. People trying to build houses are getting a 5% levy on all concrete products and everyone in the country building today is paying for the mistakes that were not regulated at the time. For somebody getting their house costed at the moment, based on today's prices, the VAT could help that burden. That is a solution for part of the problem.",
                "The other part of the problem is the Government is paying this as 100% redress, as the Minister said.",
                "Why does it not fund the people and give bank guarantees to them in the same way as for anyone building a new house today? Why does it not give people their payments based on the building as it goes on? If a person has to come up with a small bit of money, they can try to fundraise themselves. That, to me, is a solution. Why would the Minister charge tax on redress of 100%? Addressing this is within his remit.",
                "If I am pricing a project, it is based on a period of three months. How long is it going to take for the system to come into place and how long is it going to take for people to qualify? By the time the Minister moves the goalposts, prices will have gone up again. Is there not something to be said for index-linking based on the cost of prices going up now and on current inflation costs, as shown by economists? All of this is at the Minister’s fingertips. I have to cost daily, so why can the Minister not do so? Where there are Government contracts, rising costs are built in. Therefore, why can this not be done for everyone else?",
                "I want the Minister to exempt the tax people are supposed to pay where there is 100% redress. This will go some way towards paying for the houses that need to be rebuilt."

Through the vote we have had on the amendment on blocks, he has made Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael TDs from all of the impacted counties, including Mayo, do something they know is absolutely wrong. One hundred percent redress means 100%, not more or less; it is just what it takes to make up for the lack of legislation or the failures by the Government. It is not because of any failure of the homeowners, as we have said many times here, but because of the abject failure of the Government that 100% redress is needed.",

If somebody gave us a rationale for it and stated how it is and has to be, we could look at that. Everybody here has tabled amendments in good faith to improve the scheme and make it fit for purpose. When we submitted all our points on the original scheme, including those we are making now, we wanted to save the Government money. Our bottom line was that we wanted to ensure nobody would be locked out of the scheme because they could not afford to get into it. By rejecting amendment No. 5, the Minister would be continuing to lock people out who cannot afford to get into the scheme. This is because the gaps we are talking about are €40,000, €50,000, €60,000 or €100,000-plus. That is an awful lot of money and it is absolutely crucifying people. It is not only crucifying the mortgage holders, as their children will be paying back because of the huge gaps.",

At the time, we did not really know what was happening. I said to the couple affected, who had to rebuild the house and who had saved all their lives, that something had to be done with the house. I said the county council could not help them out but that I was sure that if they kept all their receipts and kept every record properly such that the project could be thoroughly audited, they would not be excluded from any scheme put in place. If the Minister is going to refuse to accept amendment No. 7, he will be saying to the couple that there is nothing for them and that, even though they did nothing wrong and instead did everything right, leaving everything fit for audit, they are still excluded. They are neighbours of the Minister’s TDs in Mayo. They know them, they know their faces, and they know their families. I am totally dismayed.",

The affected homes are going to deteriorate and crumble, and their owners are going to be prisoners within them because the Government has a scheme that does not allow them to rebuild. Under the scheme, people are forced to find tens of thousands of euro. I spoke to one individual who described the absolute nightmare he went through for a number of years.",

It fails people because the Government is demanding of them that they put their hands in their pockets, go into debt and find tens of thousands of euro, whether they are borrowing it for families, digging into nest eggs or whatever it is, for something that they had no hand, act or part in. The fact is that their homes were built with deleterious materials. Indeed, it is the State that is responsible, that should be regulating these products and that is culpable, and that is why 100% redress should be provided.",

I agree with Deputy Conway-Walsh that there are TDs who are genuine because they know neighbours and, in some cases, family members who are involved, but they know that this legislation is locking them into a nightmare, not for next year or the year after, but for tens of years. There are elderly people who have no income outside of the State pension. Where will they get the €50,000, €60,000 or sometimes €90,000 to rebuild their house? This is not going away. We will be back here and the only thing that will change is that these homes will be more expensive to rebuild in the future because the Government is refusing to deal with the reality here and now.",

You would find it tough to walk the length of yourself and not know somebody who was living in a home that was crumbling, who was a victim of the defective block scandal. That has spread in the east of the county and elsewhere in the west of the county. Every single day, we hear of more and more cases in the west, whether in Gweedore, Glenties or Kilcar. It goes right through.",

It would be perverse were it the case, but is it the plan to force people to find the €100,000 to rebuild their homes and then have to deal with the ones who never had that money in the first instance, could not borrow or could not get a loan or another mortgage, and then provide something for them in five, seven, eight, nine or ten years?",

I try to think of them like my mum, sister or somebody I know personally. On this issue, I find it impossible to step into their shoes because I have been in their homes and I cannot imagine the nightmare that they are going through. What the Government is doing is cruel beyond words. The Minister should accept the Sinn Féin amendments. They make sense. They have the backing of the community and of the campaigns.

                "I want to speak to and support the amendments. The starting point is that, as I have said before in this Chamber, housing is a fundamental human right. I do not think it is a coincidence that there is no mention of housing being a human right in the Government's new housing plan, because what is going on in Donegal, Mayo and other counties, including Limerick, Sligo and Clare, shows why housing is a fundamental human right. We have people, children and families living in housing situations that are completely unsustainable, with holes in walls, children crying and worrying about whether the house will fall down, and families and parents crying at night wondering what they are going to do in these homes. They feel completely unsafe. I have written about the psychological concept called ontological security. It is the sense that we feel completely secure in ourselves as people and in where we are. In housing, that concept is applied to the notion of your home being somewhere where you feel safe deep inside yourself. It is not just whether you are safe from threat of violence, but whether you can rest and be at peace there. In Donegal, Sligo, Limerick and Clare, people clearly cannot be at peace in their homes when their homes are literally crumbling around them. That is why housing has to be treated as a fundamental human right, particularly the standard of that housing.",
                "I referred earlier to the briefing paper provided by the Oireachtas. The figures are stark and show that what is currently being done by the Government about defective concrete is absolutely inadequate. Of 3,000 applicants, the number of applicants who have commenced work on both schemes is just 1,000. The number of applicants who have completed the works is just 324. At that rate, it will be next century before the actual issues of defective blocks, defective concrete and defective building materials are dealt with.",
                "Donegal is suffering a housing crisis and housing disaster like nowhere else. Where will people go when the work is being done? I just looked on daft.ie. There are just 35 places to rent in Donegal. There were 83 evictions in Donegal in the third quarter of this year. As many evictions will probably happen this year as the number of applicants who have actually had the remediation works completed. There is a cluster of multiple housing crises in Donegal and in the other counties affected. One in four is living on a low income. Where will people get the money to cover the costs when it is not 100% redress? In my view, what it shows is the complete failure of a market approach to housing and the complete failure of regulation. There is no prospect of the disaster that is being lived in Donegal right now being dealt with if we rely on the market to solve it. That is where the State has to intervene. It has to intervene to provide 100% redress. It has to start looking at finance and actually supporting homeowners to have the finance to be able to rebuild, including borrowing and low interest rates, to cover the costs.",
                "Where are people going to get the money to do the rebuilding? The idea that they somehow are going to front it up is not on.",
                "The employment of construction workers was raised. Who will do the construction? A factory in Cavan which builds modular homes has shut down because of the lack of work and yet the State would not step in, buy it and start producing modular homes that people could move into and the work could be done. The State has to step in in a way that we have not seen this State do since the 1950s and 1960s. It has to do it in Donegal, Limerick, Mayo and Clare, and it needs to be part of us solving our housing crisis.",
                "We have a housing crisis in Donegal, as I said, and in these counties where people's homes are crumbling. We also have homelessness there. We have people who cannot afford to rent. We have a generation leaving the country. We have homes that are not up to standard in my constituency, in Ballymun and Finglas. The housing issue in this country is an absolute disaster. It is not just people who cannot buy a home but the quality of homes. The private sector, the market, does not have the capacity to deal with it. We need an emergency State intervention. I believe that requires a State construction company. It requires State finance. It requires the State stepping in or else we will be left with people living in substandard homes, in dangerous homes and without a home, not just for decades to come but, as I said, into the next century."

This is not new, of course. Donegal, Mayo and other areas, all the way down to Clare, have suffered the same. The scheme the Minister is putting forward does not go far enough to be able to deal with these issues. That is why I wanted to speak in support of the amendments because these amendments go to the heart of the issue.",
                "We are talking about making sure that people get 100% redress. We are talking about ensuring that people have an adequate sense of somebody having their back because they have been let down for so long by so many. The reason we are in this situation is very lax regulation; that is the reality. The quarries that produced these defective products have got away with it and now the houses that were built are crumbling around their owners. These people absolutely need to ensure that we can do something which will be adequate to provide for them and for their future.",
                "I have come across people in my constituency who are at the very early stages of this. They are noticing cracks and seeing things, although they are certainly not as advanced as we see in Inishowen and other parts of the country. They recognise the fight that people there are having to try to get adequate redress and they are wondering if they will be facing the same down the road. It is not just in that part of Sligo, but in other areas as well because many of these building companies and quarries shared products over and back. When one supplier of blocks was running low, it got a couple of loads from somewhere else. So, somebody bought blocks from one particular supplier not knowing that the product had come from a different quarry perhaps 50, 60 or 100 miles away. This will spread across a large area of the country. It will not be confined to the counties which have got the go-ahead to be in this scheme. The Minister really needs to consider that this will be a much more widespread problem as we move forward.",
                "One of the big issues people are coming across is where they are going to go while they are getting this work done. They simply cannot rent a house anywhere else because there are no houses to rent. They cannot find any way out of this problem. Some people have decided that they have to buy a mobile home or get some kind of a demountable dwelling or something put on their back street, if they can. Even that is very difficult because they do not have the money to invest in all of this. They certainly do not have the confidence to be able to go and borrow that money because they do not know if the Government scheme will back them up. That is the problem we have got here.",
                "We also have the issue of who will do the work. Where will they get the workers to do this? We are in a real crisis here and one of the few things we would expect people to be able to stand by is that the Government that let them down in the past by allowing these lax regulations that got them into this mess in the first place would now step up to the plate and ensure that there is adequate redress and an adequate scheme, so that they can have the confidence to be able to look to the future. However, very many people cannot look to that future.",
                "This is why I implore the Minister to look again at these amendments and not just cut them down. He should not put us in the position where we will be coming back again and again representing our constituents in my area and all the other areas around the country affected by this problem. It affects many other parts of the country as well. It will not be isolated to a few small areas. It may become very widespread in the future because defective building materials were not confined to county boundaries. They did not put up a fence and say, \"You can't cross here\". They have gone all over the place and there needs to be recognition of that as well.",
                "Even at this late stage, it is not too late to step up, accept the amendments and put a scheme in place that would provide for people. That would ensure we have something in place which will save time, give people confidence and actually save money in the long run. That is what the Minister needs to do. I appeal to him at this stage, on behalf of my constituents in Sligo-Leitrim and people across the whole country who are affected by this, to step up to the plate here, recognise that what he is doing is flawed, accept the amendments and move this legislation forward in such a way that we can have confidence and the people who are in this terrible mess can have confidence in their future."

I went to New Orleans and I remember the catastrophic, severe flooding the city had when buildings fell overnight. When I went around my constituency, I saw buildings that are crumbling slowly in Donegal. It is not just about bricks and mortar. It is about the human factor.

I must speak on their behalf. I believe that there is not 100% redress. I am meeting people who cannot raise the funds to have the initial preparatory works carried out. The banks have to take some blame as well. They do not want to help the people affected.

Irrespective of who is here in the future, I suggest that there could be three, four, five or six more Dáileanna and this will still be ongoing. I believe it has to be resolved. One way to resolve it is to give people an opportunity to move into modular homes that can be located in various parts of my county and in other counties. The big problem at the moment is that even if people have the money, they are not in a position to move out or find alternative accommodation.",

While I support a lot of what has been said, I have always been loyal to my party and I believe I can serve the people of Donegal better if I continue to work with the Minister, who I believe is genuine in trying to resolve this problem, rather than being a hero tonight and voting against my party, as one Deputy did many years ago before evaporating. I feel strongly about this and I have been making a case to the Minister. I am making that case publicly tonight and I will continue to do so.

We have the incredible situation of children sleeping in rooms on windy, stormy nights in fear that the building is going to collapse. I have no doubt this is leading to significant problems physically, but the mental and psychological scars arising from the defective concrete crisis are immense. It has had an enormous impact on the people of Donegal, Mayo, Clare and other counties. The cost of those scars to society is unquantifiable. I have no doubt that many of those scars are going to wash through this generation of individuals.",

There is no doubt in my mind that the system of light-touch regulation we had in this country over many years, which was overseen by Fianna Fáil, in large part allowed this defective concrete to be sold and put into the housing infrastructure of large parts of this country. Indeed, there is still not accountability in terms of the quality of construction products in the market at the moment. This problem is rife, not only in homes but also in much of the other infrastructure in this country.",

There is an enormous gap between the money that is necessary to do the work and the money that is being offered by the Government. This scheme is leaving many families with increased mortgages and debts. It is so difficult to operate that it is impossible for many people to use.",

The Government is speaking from both sides of its mouth on defective concrete and redress. It is trying to pretend this is something it is not. The people at the difficult end of this, those living in homes that are crumbling around them and trying to get them rebuilt, know this is not true. My worry is that other people watching this debate, the people from other counties who are not directly affected, will just nod their heads and think it is all right and the problem is being sorted out because there is money being spent on it. I appeal to the Minister opposite to listen to the TDs from Donegal, Mayo and other counties and to put himself in the place of an individual who has spent their life savings investing in building a home and is now seeing that home destroyed by a building material that was allowed onto the market as a result of the lack of regulation by a particular government and is then left to swing, in large part, for big chunks of the cost of that. I appeal to the Government to do the right thing and make sure it delivers 100% redress."

When contractors come out and look at the property, they wonder whether they are going to put stilts under the roof or prop up the roof and ask where they will start the demolition and where they will start the rebuild. The remediation options are not working.",

Many Deputies in the Opposition and on the Government backbenches, as well as member of the media, noted that the people who are affected are the taxpayers of Ireland. It is their homes that are falling in. In an appeasement that evening, which gave great hope to many of us, we heard there was going to be a landmark legal case taken by the State and the Attorney General was preparing a huge case against the quarries and the concrete block manufacturers, one of which is one of the biggest companies in Europe, Roadstone, which is part of CRH. Let us name that company and put a face to this. There was to be a landmark legal case taken so the companies would pay and rather than the taxpayers paying, it would actually be the companies that were culpable that would pay for all of this. I ask the Minister to give the House an update on that. I understand it is a colossal case and it will be challenged. The Minister is a good person but we need to hear there is some movement on that case because someone should pay for this. At the moment, this is on the pages of the Government. It is taxpayer's money funding remediation for taxpayers but someone has to pay for this. The levy in itself is not sufficient. That landmark case must be taken. It would be a bit of retribution, which this country needs.",

There is a recurring theme and I am guessing it is similar in Donegal, Mayo and other places. It was from a builder who stated there is probably a little bit of pyrite or mica in every single block. It is a chemical constituent that is in the ground. It is mined and gets mixed in a batching plant. If there is sufficient cement in the concrete block and it has a decent constitution, it will probably withstand that. In anything I have seen, the common theme is deterioration of the concrete, crumbling and asymmetrical cracking. When I look at the gable end of these houses, I always ask the person if they got pumped insulation. They will say they did and when I ask when, they will say about three years ago. I will then ask when the cracks began and they will say it was about two years ago. It is a common theme.",

While they are essential - I am not saying we should scrap or pause them - someone has to give some advisory note to people who are applying for SEAI grants that the house that is beautifully painted and standing proud may become more susceptible. For all we know, there could be deleterious material in those blocks that will be activated when they bore through them and start pumping material into them, which causes water and chemical agents to engage with the blocks.",

The Bill, primarily under sections 8 and 10, includes amendments to the principal Act to provide for the retrospective payments and these will be discussed under amendments Nos. 33 and 35. The two Committee Stage amendments covered under amendments Nos. 20 and 40 have also been brought into the debate.

As Deputy Ward is aware, the defective concrete blocks grant scheme is not a compensation scheme. A charging order under the defective concrete block scheme for rental properties is required to help to ensure remediated properties remain available to rent once remediation works have been completed. Officials in the Department, with the assistance of various stakeholder groups, have worked over the past four years with key stakeholders to help to ensure matters relating to homes affected by defective concrete blocks with mortgages have been addressed. For these reasons, I cannot accept the amendment."

In fairness to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Harris, who is new to his brief, he said, to paraphrase, there was merit in what was being raised and he would engage constructively with the Department and the Minister for housing, Deputy Browne, in that regard. He made the point, which is a fair one, that it is the Minister for housing or a different Department that comes up with a scheme. The Department of Finance is then asked to examine the merits of the scheme and whether it has a tax implication. It has to originate from another Department, however. The Minister mentioned that this legislation was coming up as a potential way to deal with this. That is why it is raised here.",
                "To provide context to this amendment, we talked earlier about the core issues with the flawed scheme that is and will continue to be in existence after this legislation. A number of core issues were dealt with in Sinn Féin amendments, such as 100% redress and an end-to-end scheme, that, unfortunately, the Government parties rejected. This is more of a tangential issue. It is not going to change the world for people; the major problems will still exist. For people going through the scheme, however, there is a major issue of housing. Where will they live during the remediation of their house? Where will they live as the house is being knocked to the ground and rebuilt? While there are a number of ways to deal with that, the one way not to is exactly what the Government is doing, that is, nothing. The Government is basically leaving it up to individuals to try to find mobile homes or demountables, move in with neighbours or family or search for rental properties in a county where they are few and far between. We need a bit of forward planning in this regard. There are a number of parts to the solution, including the accommodation of modular homes. I think Deputy Ward has an amendment later on that and Deputy the Cope Gallagher mentioned that possibility as well. They could be accommodated in certain areas. I am conscious that I speak on behalf of Donegal because it is the people of Donegal who put me here.",
                "I am conscious too that individuals in Mayo, in Clare, and elsewhere are also affected. The one thing that those counties have is a lot of vacancies, including a lot of holiday homes. I dealt with a family recently who are in a desperate situation. They cannot find a place to live. They literally cannot find a place to live. They are competing with people who have got notices to quit and they are competing with families who maybe want to move into the area and so on. The housing is not there. Yet we all know in our local communities, if we look around, that there are a lot of vacant houses. There might be a house that was in a family's ownership, the mother or father may have passed away or a brother may have passed away or so on and it was left to an individual. There are a lot of holiday homes as well in Donegal and down the west coast. This amendment is trying to incentivise. It is not for the rental sector because we do not want to interfere with the rental sector. The rental sector is there and we do not want to compete with that sector. We want to try to entice people who own homes that are not permanently occupied to make them available to individuals who are having their homes demolished and rebuilt under the scheme. The template that I came up with is to ensure that the rental income they would receive as a result of that, received only from somebody who is going through the scheme, would be exempt from tax. Is there a precedent for this? Yes. The Government introduced the accommodation recognition payment, ARP, which is only available to Ukrainians. In the county of Donegal there are over 2,000 homes that are rented out to Ukrainians and the rental income is tax free for the owners of those homes. This is in no way about pitching one over the other. It is absolutely not about that. It is about stating this already exists in law. It exists for what is called a humanitarian disaster. I have my own issues in relation to that scheme because it does interfere with the rental market and belatedly the Government has recognised that. The proposal in this amendment would not do that because it would only be for those properties that were not rented, or should be registered with the Residential Tenancies Board, in the last three years. It is very much targeted at vacant homes that have never been rented or holiday homes where somebody might be willing to do this for the year and a half during which families are rebuilding their homes. That is what this amendment is about.",
                "This can happen. I understand that the Government will not budge on the other issues. They have just voted down what are sensible amendments but this can happen. This provision already exists in my county and elsewhere in a big way for Ukrainians but it does not exist for people from Donegal or elsewhere whose homes are affected by defective blocks. Will the amendment change the availability of homes overnight? No. But if it deals with one family so that they find a place to live when their home is being rebuilt then so be it. The beautiful thing about this as well is it that is has an endpoint. It is only available through the construction and rebuilding of the home. Hopefully it would also have another benefit, which is to make rental properties cheaper. On rental income, obviously, they are not rental properties at the minute, but the house they would rent out would be cheaper because it would be tax free and that allows for more money to be available to the individual in relation to the rebuilding of their home under the very flawed scheme that we have before us.",
                "That is the proposition. The Minister for Finance said there is merit to the issue and wanted to constructively engage with it. I cannot see a reason we do not move on it. It is definitely worth trying. It will not change the world but it could help many families. If we can just do that, it would be a job well done in terms of supporting this amendment."

There was a period of ten or 11 years where virtually no social housing was built in Donegal. Therefore, the private rental sector took on that role through the rental accommodation scheme and the housing assistance payment. We are now playing catch up. All of those private rental properties were taken up by that failure in that period from 2010 to 2021, which was an 11-year period. I will give an example. There were more social houses delivered in Donegal in one year in 2002 than in the 11 years since 2010 to 2021. That was a disastrous period and a disastrous policy. House prices in the county also have gone through the roof relative to income and the cost of rent has gone through the roof. People who work in good jobs, for example a couple with good employment, cannot get a mortgage from the banks. Rent is going through the roof. Rent has doubled in Donegal in the last five or six years. It has really doubled. It is so difficult to find rental property. It is heartbreaking when somebody is told that their rented house is going to be sold and they have to find somewhere else. They cannot find anywhere else. It is pure desperation. We have all of that and defective blocks too. I cannot stress how important this proposal is from Deputy Doherty. As the Deputy has pointed out clearly that it has been done for another humanitarian crisis, why can it not be done for our humanitarian crisis? It could not be more simple.",

Because of that, many people are struggling to get accommodation. When there is a capacity problem of accommodation, you have inflation. This means that families are snookered even trying to get alternative accommodation for themselves in this regard. It is really important that the Government would get creative in ensuring first that there is extra capacity in terms of combination options for people and second that there are some efforts to create downward pressure on the cost of that accommodation to people. There is a big inflationary aspect for people who are looking to get works done. Some of that is happening because of the pressure on the limited capacity but some of that is happening due to the way the money is being paid out. Some builders are front-loading the costs so that they get the money at the start of the process and then have to wait long periods of time to get paid out as well. I support this amendment and I ask that the Government supports it as well."

I will never understand how it took over a year to bring this legislation here. In our party we would have been able to draft that legislation within hours. This is not complex legislation. It is applying an increased cap retrospectively to those going through the scheme. There is no political leadership in the Department of housing and the officials will just do what they want. They are not accountable. They write the script for the Minister and they write the replies to parliamentary questions. I could show the Minister of State one reply and then show him another.",

The agency was overruling the recommendation of engineers who were on the Engineers Ireland list. These qualified engineers acting on behalf of the families recommended demolition and were overruled by the Housing Agency. When this was questioned, the agency said it was applying IS 465. We all said the emerging evidence was that standard had no credibility and that it was a bad decision the agency was making. I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister and the officials said they were applying IS 465 in proper order. They were looking at mica. Then a few months later the NSAI finally acknowledged the emerging scientific evidence was very serious and a review had to be done of IS 465. The basis for all this remediation was a hill of beans. All of a sudden the Department officials drafted a new response that said in small print the Minister always told the Housing Agency to look at pyrrhotite. They threw the agency under the bus. There is no political leadership in the Department of housing. The officials will just do what they want. They are not accountable. They will tell you one month the Housing Agency is following IS 465 and mica is the cancer that you have and therefore your house does not have to be demolished. Then a few months later they will say they were wrong about that, but in the small print it is pyrrhotite. They threw the Housing Agency under the bus. I watched that happening.",

They are not accountable. They will never have to get elected in any of these constituencies. They will never have to face the people of Donegal, Mayo, Sligo, Clare, Limerick and a growing number of other counties, but the Minister and the Ministers of State will. I had to intervene, having watched that exchange, and tell the Minister of State my experience. I hope he will reflect on that, start to show clear political direction, do what is right and not have the officials write scripts that make a mockery of this place."

                "“(5) A designated local authority shall be responsible for the performance, in its designated local authority area, of the functions assigned to it by or under this Act, and shall, within 3 months of the end of each quarter, publish on its website a summary of:",

                "Amendment No. 16 is essential because homeowners have no visibility of how long applications take or where delays are happening. Councils are already struggling, with ancillary grants taking months. Effectively, it is becoming very hard for local authorities to make progress due to the number of staff moving. There is a bottleneck that means families are stuck waiting. If the Minister resists this, it shows he is adding to the council’s workload. The council has been put to the pin of its collar and is not resourced enough.",
                "Amendment No. 50 seeks to introduce accountability and transparency into a system that has long been opaque. By requiring the Minister to produce an annual report on the operation of sections 23A and 23B, the Parliament and the public will finally have a clear, factual picture of how the defective concrete remediation scheme is working and functioning. Homeowners, the Oireachtas and stakeholders will know how many applications are received, validated or referred to the Housing Agency, how long decisions take, which remediation options have increased and the outcome of appeals, which is very important. No one should have to rely on redacted FOIs and ink-covered paper. This amendment would be a great help.",
                "Amendment No. 55 would ensure that every decision must be published in anonymised form within 90 days, showing the facts, reasoning and outcomes. Homeowners are trapped in appeals that can last for years, while the Housing Agency hides behind claims of independence. We have the Housing Agency and the Appeals Board passing the buck from one to the other, while both are operating like a secret service with no timelines or transparency. Homeowners deserve to see how these decisions are made. Enough of the secrecy and delay. Families should be able to pursue their lives without stress and uncertainty. Transparency is needed so they can trust the system.",
                "Amendment No. 56 is necessary because the Minister must make public how deleterious materials are detected, where problems are occurring and what risks are emerging. Risks are emerging everywhere. We need to make people aware of this. Publishing regional patterns and international comparisons helps to prevent repeated mistakes in the future, allows for early intervention, which is important, and builds trust that the Government and the scheme are operating together. Where we have pockets of pyrite, pyrrhotite and other deleterious materials, we can see it coming and react to it."

                "I wish to speak in support of these amendments from Deputy Ward. There is no doubt that we need greater oversight of the entire process. I spoke earlier on this issue, and I want to touch on it again. Sadly, we have an utterly deficient standard, IS 465. Basically, we have been diagnosed with the wrong cancer. Mica was not the main contributory factor to the crumbling of homes in Donegal. What has clearly emerged from international peer-reviewed research science, which it is pretty clear the NSAI now accepts, is that it is pyrrhotite and internal sulphate attack.",
                "I have to fear that the rush to label it as mica may have been influenced by the wish not to knock down all the houses and to save money, to be crude about it. I remember hearing a member of the panel on a radio station. They explained to the layperson that with pyrite, the house has to come down, but with mica, the house can stay up. I remember it so well. I am a layperson. I am certainly no scientific expert or geologist, but I trusted that. I always use the example that when I get on a plane, I trust the pilot can fly the plane and trust that the mechanics have maintained the plane well. I put my life in their hands, as everybody does. We put an awful lot of trust in experts, but the experts got it badly wrong.",
                "That flowed into a tortuous process for homeowners, where their engineers, who had looked at the house extensively, carried out the testing and been on site, said the house had to come down. They were qualified engineers who were on the list. Then there was the situation where the Housing Agency just used a desktop, it seems, looking at IS 465. Its engineers had not even visited the houses. I have already seen some of the decisions of the appeals panel. It is astonishing. Basically, there were engineers who had not gone on site and inspected the house, but had overruled an engineer who had, based on IS 465.",
                "When we raised this with the Minister, initially the Department of housing was standing over the Housing Agency. Then, when the emerging evidence became apparent, it said that, no, it was always supposed to be looking at pyrrhotite too. The Housing Agency was left on its own.",

Every time we tried to get answers from the Minister, Deputy James Browne, and the previous Minister, it was said to be an independent process. The Housing Agency has an independent process. Donegal County Council has an independent process. People waited for a year. They were already traumatised and then they had this decision. They know it is wrong, but it takes another year. Finally, the appeals panel is starting to deal with this, but it has been so slow. It is agonising.",
                "These are important amendments. They are about accountability and making sure that we can see the situation, but also the big picture. We can analyse the emerging data, see what is happening and try to improve things and make them better. They are good amendments, which I support."

This new section relates to the conditions certain conjoined dwellings such as semi-detached homes, terraced houses, etc., must meet in order to be eligible for the DCB grant scheme. It provides that where a relevant dwelling has not met the damage threshold for entry to the scheme and is attached to another relevant dwelling that has received a grant determination under the principal Act, the relevant owner of the dwelling that has not met the damage threshold can notify their designated local authority they are seeking a determination that their dwelling is deemed to meet the damage threshold. In effect, it allows them to bypass the damage threshold stage but they are still bound by all other parts of the eligibility assessment process. Where the designated local authority is satisfied, it will notify the Housing Agency of its decision and the Housing Agency will arrange for the assessment and consideration of the application and determine the appropriate grant option and amount for the dwelling. Although the principal Act does not include homeowners who wish to carry out works at the same time to the attached dwelling from doing so, it provides that each dwelling must have met the damage threshold before the application can be passed to the Housing Agency for grant determination. This can result in a delay for the relevant owners of the attached dwellings. This amendment will provide much-needed flexibility and assistance to homeowners of attached dwellings."

                "This is one of the amendments that was announced after we finally got our hands on the legislation. There was the heads of Bill as presented to the committee on housing and then there were these amendments that were added on. Here is the problem. We have a scheme that tells people they should knock down half of a semi-detached block. We have a scheme that tells you that you should pick out a terraced house out of a row but I will particularly focus on semi-detached units. It really is a minefield for builders. They are very reluctant to do these types of jobs and the prices reflect that. The SCSI costings for a typical semi-detached three or four-bedroom property that was reported back in March 2024, now approaching two years ago, would be a very different price now. Builders can just name what they want. They do not need the work and they do not really want to be doing that work. They have to physically knock down the house very carefully so as not to impact the adjoining house. In some cases, the owners of the adjoining properties are appealing to An Bord Pleanála to try to stop the work. This is a real mess. What is the Minister of State's response to that? It is incremental and minimalist; basically talking about the damage threshold. The fact is there is a whole layer of houses. This goes to the fundamental problems with the scheme. There could be somebody who is a holiday home owner and who is not eligible to take part in the scheme. There could be somebody who has more than one rental property, so this could be property number two, three or four. That is not eligible for the scheme. As these properties are not eligible for the scheme, the Government is forcing one half of the semi-detached block to be knocked down and the other half cannot be because it is not eligible for the scheme.",
                "Then, there is the issue of people who just cannot afford to go onto the scheme. They cannot access the money. Because the scheme is not working, we see, in housing estates, half a block being replaced and half staying up. It is just a mess. Rather than just accept this issue of semi-detached dwellings points to the fundamental problems with the conception of the scheme and the injustice of the scheme, what does the Minister of State come up with? A damage threshold, which is the most absolutely minimalist thing that can be done. It will make very little impact. In all of this legislation and amendments that have been presented , this amendment tells me the Government is completely and utterly out of touch with the reality on the ground in our counties. It actually is astonishing that what it came up with as a response to dealing with the mess of knocking down half of these blocks - and we see it all over our constituency - is that if there is one house that is less damaged than the other, we will let both of them go through. That is not the issue. The issue is that there is a whole clatter of houses. As most houses cannot engage with this scheme, they cannot be knocked down because either they are not eligible or the owners cannot afford it so we end up with this. This is just a deeply frustrating amendment and it points to the fact the Minister of State is just not listening. I appreciated Deputy Pat the Cope Gallagher's statement tonight. He is clear this scheme is not working. There are other Government representatives in Donegal who are clear but the problem is that the representatives the Minister of State is listening to are badly advising him. I say again that the Minister of State can ram through this legislation.",
                "By the way, it looks like he will reject the amendment. I do not see any evidence that he will accept any amendments. Mark my words: he will be back again in a year and he will be back again in another year. I will talk to both the Minister and the Minister of State when we are older men and they will say I was right that this will come back to haunt them in five years. Maybe their time in politics will be over then but it will come back to haunt those who replace them in time to come. Hopefully, in due course, we will have a government that wakes up and realises 100% redress, delivered directly by the State the same way as the pyrite remediation scheme, is the only way you will take every victim home and give them justice. Frankly, this amendment tells me everything I need to know about how short-sighted they are."

Within five minutes of my house was one of my neighbours. He moved to Letterkenny and I moved to the Finn Valley and the two of us had houses. I built my own house; he bought his. His house is semi-detached. He has children trying to go to college. His neighbour has knocked down his house. He is not in a position to get it and he would not meet the damage threshold. I have been up at his house. I put my fist through the wall and it is like an eggshell. When I did that, his wife realised how serious the issue is with them. The damage threshold does not work. Given the orientation of the house, it is protected with walls and trees. There is no weather hitting it but inside that wall that is not cracked is dust, absolute dust. This is what is going to happen. It will become common.",
                "Another aspect of it arises when we are building these houses and we are going in and separating them. For example, it costs €310,000 to rebuild a semi-detached house now. With that €310,000, you have separated it out. Another foundation has to be put in. They have had to remove the foundation because they cannot build on sand and they are separated out from the house. The houses of the people who cannot afford to get on the scheme are crumbling down around them and they are left traumatised while these people are trying to move on with their life. What happens with that is there is one house that has been ebuilt for €310,000. The market value is €230,000. Therefore we are doing it in the most expensive way for the Exchequer and we are leaving a family behind. If we did everything together, up and down, with house contractors in, we could do it at an economically valued rate and it would not be costing the Exchequer. The way we are doing every one of these houses is the worst way. As a builder, I would never touch them. I would never go near them because it does not work. A semi-detached house cannot be split, but we did it.",

We have to get a common-sense grip of this. The way we are doing this is ridiculous."

Is the Minister of State saying that if there are two homes side by side and both have applied for inclusion in the scheme, and one has been awarded a grant but the other has not because they have not met the damage threshold, there will now be a mechanism by which they can apply through the local authority or the Housing Agency for the damage threshold to be deemed to have been met when it was not originally and therefore both homes can be remediated?",
                "That seems to be what the Minister of State is saying but that is not what I am reading. If that is the case, on what grounds is the Housing Agency going to be able to overturn the original decision not to award a grant for remediation? How flexible will that flexibility be? We need more explanation of how this will actually work in real time rather than just a general statement around flexibility for us to determine how, if at all, this will be helpful for the type of homeowners Deputies Mac Lochlainn and Charles Ward spoke about."

We also had to put in a flue liner for a family friend all before 3 p.m. when the kids got home. The night before, they had to stay in their granny's because the house got tumbled and their room was left exposed. Then, the rodents - the mice - all came in. This is a constant. They are abandoned because they do not have the financial resources. It is being done in the worst way because the majority of semi-detached houses have a shared chimney breast. When you take one away, you expose the house to all the elements and people cannot afford it. I hope the Minister of State will come up to Donegal. All he will see is houses split in half and tarpaulins bolted in with timbers and in behind that are children. They are going to school every day with rodents in the house because they can get in."

                "Everyone one of the speakers is talking correctly. They have the experience. I have taken out the front of buildings with 300 or 400 tonnes of stone propped over the buildings. For a semi-detached house - it depends on the era it was built in - there could a 6 in. or 9 in. block wall in the middle separating them or there could be a stud wall built up between them with fire-lined boards on both sides. If you open and take down one property, because they were built as one unit, when one side is taken out that weakens the structure of the other side. If the roofs are cut roofs - the same ridge board runs across the top of the roofs - then the rafters are on the same wall plates, which means that if you disturb anything, you weaken it. If a house on one side is defective, the same bloody blocks are on the other side. If you open it to the elements, you make the other house defective. If a house is built as a semi, it is one unit. It is built as a block. If it is a 15-block unit, it should be treated as one unit and all of it should be brought in together.",
                "What happens if one house is said to be defective? The proper way of doing any other house is to brace it in case you take away something that may have been supporting the house. You could create something that could put people's lives in danger. Is there anything in the Government regulations to say that if one side of a house is removed and the other side collapses and injures somebody, the Government is responsible? Common sense is not that common. If it is a semi-detached house, it is one unit. It was built as one unit and it should be treated as one unit. If one side is defective, the other side is defective. If it does not meet the threshold, it should be based on the building as a whole. That is where a small bit of common sense comes into it. We need to regulate properly for this. By allowing one house to come down, that could deteriorate the other house faster. I said this at the very start when the Government said the roof had to be kept if there was an existing house. It said that the outer walls should be removed. Then it wanted the outer walls to be replaced and connected to the existing blockwork, which could crumble down the line because it has been opened to the elements. It is a sign of madness. Why does the Government not listen to people in the business, who have solutions and common sense? I know as a contractor that if you have to take down a semi-detached house, the bonding and insurance you will need to have on the second building in order to take down the first building will cost more. It has to cost more because it is a health and safety risk. Someone is being left in a health and safety risk situation. It also concerns the insurance of the person in the second half of the house. Will their insurance cover their house because somebody has removed half of the building and now they have tarpaulin on their end of it? Is their house insured? Under fire regulations or health and safety, is that house insured if a storm comes? That is what we are asking. If it is a semi-detached house, it should be treated as one building."

These houses were built by an approved housing body with the local authority and local authority mortgages.

It should be the default position that the relevant house can be done as well at the same time if it is very obvious that it has defective concrete blocks and foundations. The amendment provides that the \"owner of the attached dwelling may appeal the decision in accordance with Part 5 within 90 days of the date of the notification\".

We have spent the past three and a half hours dealing with a wide range of deficiencies within the scheme, but section 8 is the substantive element of the legislation. It relates to the application for an increase to the remediation option grant. That is something for which people on this side of the House, particularly those from the impacted counties, have been making the case for quite some time.",
                "It is important for us to remember the timeline. Legislation was rushed through the Dáil in the summer of 2022. It took a year for the regulations to be drafted, but the cap was set in the legislation in 2022. People started applying to the new scheme in 2023 and transitioning from the original scheme during that period. A core principle of the scheme was that nobody would be disadvantaged either from transitioning or applying. At the end of 2023 and in early 2024, the then Minister, Deputy Darragh O’Brien, requested the SCSI to conduct an updated assessment of the potential costings. That work, I understand, concluded in March 2024 and some updated work was done until August. The agreement in principle from the Government to introduce this legislation was then agreed.",
                "The problem is that the final subsection of section 8 refers to qualifying expenditure. Where somebody applies for the increased grant and that grant is awarded, it can be paid out only on qualifying expenditure, and that, according to the subsection, means \"expenditure, in carrying out works to satisfy the approved remediation option, incurred by the relevant owner after the date of the notification referred to in subsection (1)(a), but not earlier than 29 March 2024\". Almost everybody on this side of the House tabled amendments to remove that. I fully understand that this places a charge on the State and therefore, under Standing Orders, it is ruled out of order. I anticipated that. However, this is a really crucial section of the legislation and there is simply no justification for the date 29 March 2024 because construction sector inflation started in 2023, featuring through to the end of 2023 and into 2024. The consequence of having this arbitrary date, and it is arbitrary, is that there will be a significant number of homeowners who will have undertaken remediation, or portions thereof, prior to that date, and they will have been paying prices significantly higher than suggested by the original SCSI report that informed the cap in the legislation in 2022.",
                "For this reason, many of us on this side of the House simply cannot support this legislation. It is creating another very serious inequality. No affected homeowner should be left behind. Any affected homeowner who has experienced construction-sector inflation since the setting of the cap should be able to avail of this. We teased this out with the Minister’s officials at a meeting of the housing committee and they could not provide any credible justification for why the date was included other than that it was, if I remember correctly, the date on which the SCSI report was concluded.

Otherwise, the consequence will be that a significant group of homeowners will be significantly out of pocket because the Government is simply not backdating the increased cost as a result of inflation in accordance with an appropriate timeframe."

I said on Second Stage – the Minister might have heard my contribution – that it is deeply unjust to have a deadline of 29 March. I can guess what the rationale for it was: the publication of the SCSI report. We should remember that the first scheme was discredited and replaced by a second, which I believe was also discredited. That is my opinion and I am not asking the Minister to deal with that. What happened when the first scheme transitioned to the second scheme was that the early starters - the early movers - were not penalised. They were able to avail of the increases in caps and rates as they transferred over to the new scheme. The principle was that early movers would not be punished.",

That indicates the period it would have been examining. The report was published in March 2024, but the SCSI would have been considering the facts on the ground from 2023. It is deeply unjust, to have the deadline. What does it mean? I agree with my colleague Deputy Ward on this. He estimates that dozens of families are affected.",

It will cost them tens of thousands of euro. We have spoken to those families. I have no doubt but that they are watching this debate tonight. We have talked to them and their children. The maximum amount here is €42,000. That is a lot of money for a working family to have to pay back and beg, borrow and steal. I am asking the Minister to remove that date and to allow those early movers, the same as he did on the previous scheme, not to be punished. I ask him to not punish them for moving early. They could not hold back any longer. If the Minister does not accept it, he should listen to us tonight. He has time to bring amendments when it goes to the Seanad. I ask him to please do that."

All the different oil-based materials for houses, through different budgets, have created an increase. We are asking for fairness for 43 houses. It is a pittance when looked at in the scheme of it.

It then requires a designated local authority to issue a reminder after this period has elapsed and allows a further 14 days for the applicant to respond before it considers the application to be withdrawn. Amendment No. 46 proposes the same follow-up period to be given to an application for an updated remediation option grant where the Housing Agency requests additional information. The Bill allows the form and manner for these requests for further information to be set out in regulations. Therefore, the additional requirement is not necessary.

When Darragh O'Brien rushed through the legislation in 2022, the expectation was it would take some time for the regulations for the revised scheme to be completed. The Minister was crystal clear that he did not want homeowners to wait until the new regulations were introduced and therefore he gave a public commitment that if they proceeded to apply for inclusion in the original scheme, when the regulations for the new scheme became live they could transition to it and they would be no worse off. So, on the word of the Minister and the Government, in 2022 people would have continued to apply under the old scheme. When the new regulations came in in 2023, they would have transitioned onto that scheme. Some of those people would have had works done prior to the date of 29 March 2024. However, those works would have been more expensive because of construction sector inflation from the period of the 2022 legislation.",

It seems to make no sense whatsoever to set a date of when the report was received when it was actually examining construction sector inflation for a period prior to that. I do not know how far back the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland went - if it went back to the setting of the cap in the 2022 Bill or to the opening date of the scheme in 2023.",

It may well be that the inflation impact for them was less than for people after that date and therefore the amount of additional grant uplift they will need will be less; we do not know. However, it seems to be a completely arbitrary proposition that it is the date the Minister received the report. I ask the Minister to explain the rationale for allowing that date to be the date. Does he at least accept that there were inflationary impacts on the prices that people had to pay for works prior to that date from some point in 2023 up to but before 29 March 2024 and therefore people will be left out of pocket because of this deadline?"

I am joined by our policy and public affairs co-ordinator, Gáibhin McGranaghan. Our head of communications, Caoimhe Suipéil, is in the Public Gallery.",
                "Inclusion Ireland is the national organisation for people with intellectual disabilities and their families. We are not here to simply reflect on a single person's experience but to highlight long-standing systemic failures that deny justice, silence survivors and expose significant rights gaps in Ireland's approach to institutional abuse. At the centre of the Farrelly commission was Grace, an intellectually disabled woman whose experience shocked the country. What happened to her and the State's response must mark a turning point in safeguarding, accountability and the protection of disabled people's rights. However, Grace's experience cannot be seen as an isolated event. It must drive meaningful and lasting reform. Our research is based on a targeted, qualitative survey of human rights experts. I would like to take this opportunity to thank each of them for contributing to the report. They are: Suzy Byrne; Patricia Carey, special advocate for survivors of institutional abuse; Dr. Aoife Gallagher, associate professor, school of allied health, University of Limerick; Caoilfhionn Gallagher KC; Dr. Caroline Jagoe, Trinity College Dublin; Dr. Claire McGettrick, born Lorraine Hughes, adoption scholar and advocate; Dr. Katherine O'Donnell, UCD; Molly O'Keeffe, family member; Dr. Charles O'Mahony, University of Galway; Dr. Maeve O'Rourke, University of Galway, and Dr. Sinéad Ring, Maynooth University. I thank them for their contributions in pulling together this report and to Gáibhin for collating the findings.",
                "It gathered data from family members, people with lived experience, human rights experts and advocates finding that the commission's process was not experienced as inclusive, supportive or accessible. Respondents consistently described it as adversarial and distressing. It was the view of our participants that people with significant communication support needs were effectively excluded from the process. Non-speaking individuals and those relying on alternative communication were not provided with the supports required to participate. This exclusion represents more than a procedural weakness. It reflects a failure to uphold rights under Articles 13, 16 and 19 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, around equal access to justice, protection from violence and abuse, and the right to live independently and be included in the community. Without communication assistance, supported decision-making and trauma-informed practice, the promise of justice was not realised for many survivors. These shortcomings have direct implications for the forthcoming commission of investigation into historical abuse in schools. The scoping inquiry there identified approximately 590 allegations relating to special schools, involving 190 alleged abusers. Many of the children and adults involved may be non-speaking or cannot rely on speech to communicate. People with intellectual disabilities, particularly in segregated or institutional environments, face a well-established heightened risk of abuse. We must ensure this next inquiry does not mirror the barriers documented in our report or we risk that many of those seeking justice may once again be denied their right to participate.",
                "Future inquiries must therefore begin with a clear commitment to meaningful participation. This requires access to communication assistance, intermediaries, accessible information in easy-to-read and plain English, supported decision making, consistent with existing law and trauma-informed engagement throughout the process. Although our mandate centres on people with intellectual disabilities, these issues have wider relevance for disabled women and girls, deaf and autistic people and people with psychosocial disabilities who also experienced institutional abuse. While the report calls for is legislative reform in the longer term, we recommend three actions in the short term that are achievable under existing law and would meaningfully strengthen participation in forthcoming inquiries.",
                "The Department of the Taoiseach, working closely with relevant Departments and agencies should adopt a national accessibility and participation protocol for all commissions of investigation. This would set consistent expectations for communication supports, supported decision-making, accessible materials and survivor engagement, ensuring that inquiries are designed to include those most affected and often most excluded.",
                "Inquiries should be codesigned with survivors, disabled persons' organisations, advocacy groups and independent human rights bodies. Codesign allows barriers to be identified and addressed early and aligns with the State's obligations to involve disabled people in decisions that directly affect them.",
                "Departments and inquiry teams should apply existing law in a rights-based manner, including the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, the public sector equality and human rights duty, the Assisted Decision-Making Capacity Act 2015 and Ireland's obligations under the UNCRPD and the European Convention on Human Rights, ECHR. These frameworks already require more inclusive practice and their proper interpretation can improve inquiries immediately. Together, these steps, among the others outlined in our report, would strengthen access to justice, promote more inclusive investigations and reduce the likelihood of harm being repeated. As our report states, justice must be designed for everyone, not only for those who can most easily navigate the system. Inclusion Ireland stands ready to support the committee and the Government in advancing the reforms that survivors deserve.",
                "In a broader sense, we must also urgently examine why disabled people are four times more likely to experience abuse than their disabled peers. This is a direct result of an outdated, non-human-rights-compliant model of care and support, which is a version of institutionalisation repeating itself throughout history. If people do not have choice about where they live, who they live with and how they live their lives, then we are perpetuating systems where harm and abuse are more likely to occur.",
                "Of course, we support the development of safeguarding legislation and, importantly, as a State, we must enshrine the right to community living in our legislation. The upcoming review of the Disability Act 2005 promised in the programme for Government is an opportunity to do so and to break the cycle of harm and trauma so many of our community continue to experience. We had Grace, Brandon, Emily and Áras Attracta. It is long past time we moved on from institutionalisation and the segregation of disabled people and lived up to the ideals clearly articulated in the UNCRPD. I thank the committee and look forward to its questions."

Our appearance today follows the Farrelly commission report on Grace, a girl and woman who could not protect herself from harm, who was severely failed for a period of 20 years and experienced an appalling litany of neglect and abuse. The Farrelly commission report and the subsequent report by Inclusion Ireland identified many issues that need to be comprehensively addressed. Today, we will focus on safeguarding adults who cannot protect themselves from harm.",
                "Safeguarding Ireland is a small charity focused on raising awareness and achieving long overdue legislative change. We do not provide a service to the public, yet every day we are contacted by people concerned about adults experiencing, or at risk of, harm and abuse. The vast majority of adult abuse is carried out by someone known to and trusted by the victim. Concerns are always complex and multifaceted. We have noted an increase in gravity. Increasingly, we signpost to An Garda Síochána.",
                "Getting support or resolution is undermined and frustrated by the absence of a dedicated authority with the requisite skills, expertise and resources to understand and resolve the issues. Adult abuse can happen anywhere; it is not limited to health and social care. Citizens, professionals and organisations want to respond. They want assurance that their referral will be acted on and they want confidence in the referral pathway. Yet, there is no central source of expertise and guidance, no locus of responsibility or accountability and too little transparency.",
                "When we think about victims who may, like Grace, be non-verbal and may not be able to or supported to have their voice heard, further weaknesses in our safeguarding regime are exposed. Our current approach is not person-centred and it is certainly not victim-centred. There is a long way to go in ensuring all adults are ensured a voice in decisions about their lives. We believe a stakeholder forum should be convened urgently by the Department of Children, Disability and Equality to ensure effective and harmonised implementation of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act, ADMCA, across all sectors.",
                "While the Farrelly commission report examines Grace’s case to March 2010, many of the failures in safeguarding remain current in 2025. Safeguarding Ireland’s 2022 report, Identifying Risks - Sharing Responsibilities, concluded that:",
                "A culture that is dismissive of certain forms of abuse, that trivialises others and that plays down the human and legal rights of adults at risk, persists in Ireland. The fragmented and specialised remits of various agencies limit their potential in this regard. There is a need for a national body that can address the issue in a comprehensive and all-encompassing manner.",
                "In April 2024, the Law Reform Commission published its report, A Regulatory Framework for Adult Safeguarding, concluding that the current position is undesirable and would be greatly improved by the provision of a statutory and regulatory framework for adult safeguarding. This would entail comprehensive, cross-sectoral legislation which assigns responsibility for regulation and oversight to appropriate bodies and provides powers, duties and obligations for those who interact with adults who may be at risk across different settings.",
                "The policy for adult safeguarding for health and social care currently being developed by the Department of Health is welcome and necessary, but it is not the comprehensive response required. It is too narrowly focused. Moreover, the policy has no legislative powers of enforcement or conviction. When we appeared before the health committee in July, we proposed a roadmap for a national safeguarding authority, which must be an independent statutory agency with the following functions: to receive reports of actual or suspected abuse or harm in any sector; to respond to reports and ensure that action is taken; to direct the HSE and other statutory or non-statutory bodies to take actions to safeguard adults at risk; to have a co-ordinating role, requiring key stakeholders to work together; to conduct serious incident reviews; to set standards and monitor compliance; to assist with developing safeguarding plans; to put in place preventative measures; to oversee robust data collection; to carry out research; and to provide training, education and public awareness.",
                "Safeguarding Ireland again asks the Government to establish an interdepartmental working group on adult safeguarding. The working group must: progress adult safeguarding legislation which covers all Government Departments and agencies of the State, based on the draft legislation developed by the Law Reform Commission; plan for an independent adult safeguarding authority provided for in the legislation; and complete the statutory framework for adult safeguarding, including new offences relevant to the safety and protection of many people, like Grace, who cannot protect themselves from harm and abuse. These must include: an offence of neglect, ill-treatment, intentional abuse, reckless endangerment, withholding of care or the necessities of care or practices or systems which create the conditions in which such offences become normalised; an offence of exposure to risk of serious harm or sexual abuse; an offence of coercive control that extends to a broader range of relationships beyond the Domestic Violence Act; and an offence of coercive exploitation to include financial exploitation."

The point on the inaccessibility of the report was well made by Inclusion Ireland. I was taken aback and very frustrated that I was unable to obtain a bound copy of the report from the Department. I requested it more than once. It is very difficult to read a 2,000-page report on a computer. In addition, there was no executive summary or clear recommendations. Were the witnesses able to access a bound copy from the Department?"

We agree that the process used with the Farrelly commission was adversarial. This is what the survivors have told us. They did not feel their voices were adequately heard and it was not a supportive, trauma-informed process. To the Deputy's point, then, about us documenting the lessons learned from the process, this is why we took it upon ourselves to do this at Inclusion Ireland. It is to have a written record of the key lessons learned so that, for the next commission of inquiry, there will be a chance we can do things differently and support survivors in a different and more trauma-informed way. This has got to be our hope and intention for the commission of inquiry into historical abuse in schools. We are very focused and we have written to the judge in this regard and sent a copy of our report. We are hoping to meet him in due course to help co-design what this could look like with survivors so this process is more satisfactory."

That has been gathering dust despite being commissioned by a previous Government. The limitations of the national policy framework were pointed to in the opening statement. Given the safeguarding legislation required for vulnerable adults is already there and ready to go, are the Government's efforts on this national policy framework for safeguarding a diversion that will not necessarily add anything to that legislation? Is it, in a way, a waste of effort or is there merit in the framework? Is it potentially a complement to legislation if it is progressed?"

Our initial view is that it is a very significant policy and level of detail that has been announced. For example, it would extend to the public, private and voluntary sectors. It includes provision for co-operation and information sharing across groups, HIQA's remit to be extended to the oversight and monitoring of HSE safeguarding services, and the national independent review panel to be put on a statutory footing. There is a lot of other detail in the policy, too. The policy is, in truth, probably more comprehensive and far-reaching than we might have thought it would be. A significant level of detail is put forward in it. In that context, Safeguarding Ireland welcomes the publication of yesterday's report.",

We note that the policy does state that an implementation plan for the policy is to be published within six months. We are saying it is very important that that target be reached. It is a huge body of work and a complicated piece to implement. For example, a lot of different bodies and agencies need to be actioned and are affected. Enactment of legislation is required, as are changes to service delivery, staff training and new pathways of information sharing across services. There is also the monitoring and enforcement of the policy, so a lot of work needs to be able to happen there."

The Department's policy has a lot of mentions of co-operation and collaboration with other State bodies. We would see adult safeguarding as spanning all sectors of Irish society. Adults at risk live outside of health and social care. We would definitely see a role for an authority or a body in this position to ensure there is that co-operation between agencies in the public, private and community and voluntary sectors. This would be a major area we would like to think about over the coming weeks."

There is an opportunity coming up with the reform and review of the Disability Act, which is promised in the programme for Government, to examine what additional rights need to be put on a legislative footing to give voice to the UNCRPD and put it into practice. As we see it, the issue is the model of care itself. As Senator Harmon has rightly said, people are much more likely to experience abuse in institutional settings and large group homes and we still have quite a number of people living in those settings. What we are seeing now is a pattern of repeating institutionalisation in Ireland. We are closing congregated settings over time, albeit that is happening much more slowly than we at Inclusion Ireland would like, and 2,000 people are still living in those settings. At the same time, there are now 1,300 disabled people living in nursing homes who are under the age of 65. Furthermore, our prison population is growing and a large percentage of that population are disabled as well. We are actually reimagining institutionalisation over and over again. We have to put a stop to that and Inclusion Ireland believes that enshrining those rights in our legislation is the first step in doing that."

We cannot undo what happened to her or her experiences, or the experiences of other survivors who were part of the Farrelly commission. What we can do, however, is look forward and really push for reform at this stage. Our report on access to justice and participation highlights that while we are looking for legislative reform, and for the 2004 Act to be reviewed and reformed in time, we cannot wait for that to happen either. There is plenty that can be done as an interim stopgap. We can just interpret the Act more fully through a human rights lens, making sure that the principles of the UNCRPD and the ECHR are fully embodied in any new commission of inquiry. We can also use trauma-informed practices, accessible information and intermediaries who are appointed by the courts to support the communication, will and preference of survivors accessing justice. There is a lot that can be done without actually reforming the legislation. We are calling for that to happen in the meantime and then, in the longer term, to reform the legislation more fully to enshrine those rights."

That is why we have made the recommendation around the need for a stakeholder forum to be established by the Department of Children, Disability and Equality. Our experience of the implementation of the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act is that it has been slow and quite patchy across sectors. Sectors need to come together to agree a harmonised, good practice approach. The Deputy mentioned the transition from childhood to adulthood and transitions seem to be where problems occur. I refer here to transitions across a person's life and the fact that it is always the transitions that seem to be problematic. A seamless approach, where services have a harmonised way of implementing the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act, is really important. As people transition from childhood to adulthood, for example, or from living at home to living in a residential care setting, they need to be seamlessly supported so that they themselves, their decision-maker or their family are not starting afresh with every change in their life."

Often, they are the people for whom access to justice is the most difficult and challenging and they experience the most barriers. We welcome the question. Individuals who communicate who are non-speaking or cannot rely on speech to communicate should be given access to assistive technology and any supports they need to communicate their will and preference. There are other structural things that can be done in accessing justice and the right to participate. The court can appoint an intermediary, for example, somebody who works alongside a person. There is a training course in the University of Limerick for intermediaries and there are a number of registered intermediaries in the country funded by the Department of justice. They work alongside the person, get to know them, their communication style and preference and support the person to access justice and have their voice heard in a matter that is meaningful for them. As we said in our report, there are already resources available in the system that can support people's access to justice, it is just about joined-up thinking and putting those supports in place in advance. With any commission of inquiry or any participative structure in health, social care or beyond, it is the thinking in advance that needs to happen. Often, things are designed with the non-speaking person outside the door. They need to be at the table with their supporter or family member to co-design what will work for them. In doing so, we save time, energy, resources and make sure that person can vindicate their rights. If we impose terms of reference or a process that does not work for the person, the person is continuously left outside the door."

We believe organisations have a lot to do in transforming processes to support people. The Act is based on adopting the least intrusive approach and the presumption of capacity. We find, and I suspect colleagues in Inclusion Ireland also find, that people encounter barriers around the issue of capacity and the presumption of capacity. One area identified in the Grace case was Grace's access to her credit union account. We see quite frequently, and I think others across sectors will identify, that people still encounter difficulties with basic things like opening a bank account. There is a lot of upskilling and awareness-raising required across key organisations in particular in essential service provision so that the person does not always have to advocate for themselves to get services they have a right to."

We are hearing from people with intellectual disabilities and from family members that there is often a misinterpretation of the Act. For example, one principle of the Act is for a person to express their will and preference, they might want a supporter like a family member to engage and support them with that. Family members tell us they are often shut out from those conversations, which is a total misinterpretation of the Act. If it is the person's will and preference to have a family member there to support them, that should be supported. Like with all things, when a new piece of legislation comes in, implementation is often dealt with in a very black and white way. We need to open up a nuanced conversation about it and make sure people's full rights are respected in the roll-out. I agree with Safeguarding Ireland that it is every organisation's business to make this work. It is our business at Inclusion Ireland to make sure we provide information to the public that is real and meaningful, that families understand their role and disabled individuals understand theirs and their rights. We have a road to go with it. We respect the principles of the Act 100% at Inclusion Ireland. We want to see it implemented properly. The misinterpretation is what is holding us back. More communication on that, more culture change and more focus on the principles and making sure the person's voice is front and centre are needed."

It is therefore a matter of balance. Sometimes in this State, the legislation can be absolutely right, given our historical human rights ethos, but we do not have the necessary protection for those who need a step-in intervention, particularly given that we do not necessarily have the perfect placements or supports.

This is incredibly important and we are rightly focused on making the system better, but there is a whole world to be lived beyond access to therapies.

What is important regarding what was published yesterday is that we move towards a plan and resource implementation and the skill set to implement it; however, we are saying there are some gaps and points to be added to in terms of cross-sectoral matters, particularly in the area of financial abuse.

It is putting them in the place that is most convenient for the State, not for the person. I saw a 33-year-old with an acquired brain injury who had a brain tumour and surgery at nine years of age and whose mother is incapacitated at the moment. The respite care for that person is two weeks in an Alzheimer's unit in a private nursing home. The mother is now incapacitated and has asked for three months of respite while she undergoes her treatment and recovers. I hope she will do well but the offer will be three months in this Alzheimer's unit, for a 33-year-old suffering with an acquired brain injury. We have a long way to go in dealing with the issue of independent living and different offerings for different people. It cannot be binary, just in the home or not. Independent living may not be possible or convenient but if people are in an institution, safeguarding is critical.",

One of the biggest issues I see as a GP with an ageing demographic is older people who suffer some cognitive impairment as they get older and who watch neighbours and family members taking control of their finances and removing autonomy from that person. That is a growing area. In addition, we need to communicate with the wider community. I spoke about Alzheimer's to Western Alzheimers, which will do a walk in a week's time, and tried to get the point across that they are not walking for other people who are a minority; they are walking for themselves. As we get older, there will be an increase in Alzheimer's and dementia. I am also conscious of getting older myself. People can get acquired aphasia, acquired brain injury, degenerative diseases or have a stroke in the morning. We need to be appealing to the wider population on this. It is not simply a minority report for a minority of our people. This is a report that may affect everyone in the future and might affect them quite precipitously, if they have an illness. We need better commitment to more meaningful communication to draw a wider community in.",

They come to us because we are called Safeguarding Ireland. It is in the policy proposals launched by the Department of Health yesterday that any new entity needs to be very visible because it should be easy to contact the relevant body. Ideally, it should be contactable around the clock, Monday to Friday, and so on because safeguarding issues can occur at any time of day or night. Our contacts and queries tend to spike following something like the \"RTÉ Investigates\" documentary that was aired in July. After something like that, we will certainly see an increase. People will have been thinking that something might be a problem and might be abuse. Then when they see something that says it is abuse, they will reach out for help. In general, as awareness grows, so will referrals. Therefore, again looking at the Department of Health's policy proposals, it would be interesting to see some kind of demand and capacity projection about how many queries or referrals are anticipated and what the resolution times and so on will be."

When Safeguarding Ireland comes back with a considered view on the policy, one of the things we will advocate for is that it will remain the case that there is one central national point that any concern around elder abuse goes to. The current HSE structure, for example, is nine to five. Out-of-hours services have also come up publicly as an issue in the past. We also know from research we have done that because there is a lack of awareness of where and how to report, there is under-reporting. The lived experiences of adult abuse are at a higher rate than what is reported. If it were clearer where to report to, it is likely the number of reports would increase significantly in tandem."

Disabled people in general are four times more likely to experience abuse and that is not because it is inherent to disabled people; it is because of the situation and models of care they find themselves in, which perpetuate abuse and set up the kinds of structural issues that cause abuse to happen and where abuse can be fostered. We are very focused on the need for safeguarding legislation and reform. Inclusion Ireland is fully behind it and we are also very focused on the articulation of the UNCRPD in our legislation because we absolutely need to see a move forward from ad hoc crisis responses to people, which are wholly unsatisfactory and end up with people living in institutional type settings.",

We often use the hallmark of if you do not have a choice about where you live, who you live with or how you live your life, you are living in an institution. Whether that is with four or 60 people, you are living in a setting without those fundamental freedoms and rights being honoured and respected.",

There is a lot of confusion about what \"independent living\" actually means. It is about choosing to live in your community. It does not mean you live without support. In fact, there can be a whole range of supports. Some people might need round-the-clock support to live independently. Some people might need a small amount of personal assistance. It is the choice and control over your life that is the fundamental piece. Until we put power back in the hands of disabled people and their families, we will continue to see these patterns of repeated institutionalisation and segregation."

Families have made contact when there was an emergency with a family member, whether a child, teenager or adult, with an intellectual, sensory or physical disability. There does not appear to be any emergency planning or an out-of-hours framework. Have the witnesses been asked to provide, or do they provide, say, a template or framework document for HSE disability services?",

The Irish Pharmacy Union and the network of community pharmacies throughout the country have a sufficient cohort of team members who interact with members of the public on a cross-spectrum of health issues. Perhaps that avenue could be explored. Do the witnesses have any opinions on that? I appreciate that is a bit of a shot across the bows."

Our capacity to provide that service is not ideal. In terms of providing reporting, that should sit within the public service system. That is where it should be. We hope that with the implementation of the health and social care plan, that can be covered. However, one consideration is that when you look at the reporting of safeguarding concerns, it has wider considerations than just health and social care. If a person comes up to attend a GP and there is a concern around financial abuse, if the terms of the reporting relate only to health and social care, it does not go far enough. If there is a criminal concern or issue, that would also fall outside health and social care. We want that reporting facility or service promoted and made available to people on a cross-sectoral basis. Siting that within our public services would be a stronger and more permanent approach that than siting it within Safeguarding Ireland."

If we trace back for one, two or three years before that crisis situation, hands were being held up and red flags were being raised by doctors, nurses and families, saying that the situation will arise. Unfortunately, the State does not seem to be in a position as yet to intervene early and appropriately, and with community-based supports at a time and in a way that people and their families need. We end up in situations that cost the State a fortune and that fly in the face of the UNCRPD and the human rights framework. Looking at the national human rights strategy for disabled people, we call for a lot more focus and emphasis on the prevention of those crisis situations and supporting people earlier in communities."

We know there are people who are in quite powerful positions who have made disclosures and whistleblown, and they have found that careers have been stunted, stalled or destroyed. We can imagine how difficult a step that is for a healthcare worker on low wages and in tenuous employment. This brings me to my point, which all the witnesses have alluded to in previous contributions, that if we have a fragmented and complex reporting system, that in itself is a barrier to making a report, unless there is one direct funnel of support. Even in a situation where we can do that, say with Tusla and child abuse, it is still difficult. It is even difficult for professionals who might feel more empowered than other people. If we have a fragmented and complex system as we have here, and the witnesses have pointed this out, then this very much needs to be addressed in this framework. I have asked the question a few times, and while the health and social model part it is fine, I am beginning to see that the framework published yesterday is not comprehensive enough when we look at the Law Reform Commission's recommendations from 2024. We probably have a bit of work to do at this committee on that aspect of it.",

These are busy people who are under pressure themselves, and it then suddenly slides into the background and moves on. The witnesses talked about under-reporting."

                "There is reporting ongoing within health and social care. My experience is of people who see an adult safeguarding concern in the community and come to us thinking we are the organisation that actually provides the service and can help. We look at the query or the concern and we see often that there are multiple dimensions to it. There might be something happening in the home. There might be something happening with relation to a social welfare payment that is belonging to the adult and it may not be spent on the adult. There might be issues relating to care or medication management and medication mismanagement. There might be issues relating to the property of the person, their home, their right to ownership of their home or there might be issues to do with people having been left money in a will and never getting access to it. It is a really multidimensional and complex concern. We would signpost always to the HSE and to the adult safeguarding and protection teams regionally. There would be other dimensions to that concern, however. What we would see as being absolutely essential is that there be a body that could take all of that on and work in close collaboration with the other agencies. There may be concerns for An Garda Síochána, the Department of Social Protection and the financial institutions, and obviously for the person at the centre of all this who is really concerned and confused. Streamlining that and giving certainty as to what the process is once the referral is made and what happens next should, I firmly believe, be in the public domain. We should know. The person is often really concerned that the issues will escalate, that it will result in a lack of care for them, or that somebody will not be there to help them with day-to-day living. That absolutely needs to be streamlined. I would say that it definitely inhibits reporting."

What we do know is that there is a national advocacy service for adults. It is chronically underfunded and now has a long waiting list. That needs proper resourcing so that the person who has a concern or who might be experiencing abuse has somebody to walk alongside them to navigate the complexities of that system and support them in all of those elements. Just last year we published a piece of research on the need for a children's advocacy service as well. Children and families are telling us that their child has been labelled as complex but it is actually the systems they are navigating which are incredibly complex. They need an advocate or somebody in their corner to walk alongside them and support the family in looking at the hierarchy of needs, support them to be resilient, support them to navigate all of those complexities, and ultimately get a good outcome for children."

I am the assistant secretary general of the Department of Social Protection with responsibility for regional operations, which includes the CWS. I am joined by my colleagues Noel Hand, the principal who leads our CWS, and Sinéad Goodwin, who is an assistant principal on the national CWS management team. I hope that members have found the background briefing material on the supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme and the schemes administered by the CWS that was provided in advance helpful.",
                "The CWS provides financial support to people on low incomes or who are facing exceptional hardship. It is the safety net support in place to help individuals and families whose income is insufficient to meet essential needs. It provides emergency assistance in the form of once-off payments for urgent situations such as unexpected bills or funeral costs, supporting people when life presents unexpected challenges. The CWS operates across the country and has services in place to ensure that no person is left unsupported when they need support. The service provides a range of flexible responsive income supports. It also assists individual and households in response to emergencies, including the aftermath of weather events.",
                "During 2025, the service has supported communities, including the island communities, in the aftermath of Storm Éowyn and most recently in Wexford for Storm Claudia. Community welfare officers, CWOs, have also supported the arrival of sick children from Gaza and other persons fleeing to Ireland from international conflict. While the priority is the provision of critical financial assistance, the CWS has a broader societal role. This role encompasses working collaboratively with community-based social services and other Government agencies to ensure the protection and support of the most vulnerable individuals within our society. CWOs work closely with charities, NGOs such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and other State services. They work alongside and liaise with homeless services, palliative care teams, hospital and community social workers, crisis intervention teams, community nurses, gardaí and carers' associations. Our officers engage with tenancy sustainment officers within Housing First organisations, approved housing bodies and local authorities. Officers also support victims of domestic violence ensuring that emergency needs are met quickly and discreetly. This broad level of engagement shows that the CWS is not just about payments; it is about co-ordinated welfare support for vulnerable people across the country.",
                "Access to the CWS is important. The delivery of crucial and locally based community welfare services to meet the challenges and the needs of people across the country is a priority for the Department. The CWS continues to provide a flexible service to meet the different needs of people who may find themselves in a financially difficult or vulnerable situation. It is important that this service is accessible and responsive to people’s needs. People can access the CWS in several ways, namely in person, by phone or email or by making an online application. Local face-to-face engagement with customers continues, however, to be the cornerstone of the CWS and this aspect of the service is in place across the country and will not change.",
                "CWOs are available to meet with the public in over 51 locations across Intreo centres, social welfare branch offices and a number of Department of Social Protection offices across the country. In the majority of locations, CWOs are available on a walk-in basis. There are also CWOs available on designated days each week in number of other locations. In addition, CWOs are available to meet people by appointment, including at a person’s home if requested. Furthermore, a customer does not have to call in person or travel to an office in order to apply for a SWA claim or an additional needs payment or to make an enquiry. If it is more convenient for him or her, a customer can call our national CWS freephone line where he or she can also speak directly to a CWO who can deal with his or her query and if appropriate, arrange the issuing of a payment.",
                "At of this month, approximately 75% of the customer queries to the CWS phone line are dealt with without the need for the person to leave his or her home and to travel to see a CWO. The phone service has a high satisfaction customer rating and an increasing number of customers are availing of this option. It is also important to mention that SWA forms are available in Intreo centres and social welfare branch offices and can also be downloaded from gov.ie. If the person would prefer to have a form posted to him or her, he or she can request a form by phoning the freephone line or completing a form request on gov.ie. In addition, people can apply online for an additional needs payment on MyWelfare.ie. Approximately 30% of additional needs payment applications are now made online.",
                "There are currently 500 whole-time equivalent staff in place across all grades in the CWS, an increase from 412 in 2022. This staffing resource reflects the commitment the Department has to the important and valued work being done by the CWS. The resources include 304.8 whole-time equivalent CWOs based across the country. These CWOs are supported by a network of administrative hubs that undertake routine administrative tasks and functions in support of front-line services. One of the functions of the hubs is to register applications on our systems and ensure claims are ready to be awarded by the relevant CWO. The work done by the hubs ensures that CWOs can focus on front-line activities and provides the capacity and time for CWOs to deliver high-quality services. The hubs include a national rent supplement team that looks after the processing and maintenance of rent supplement claims. Special arrangements are in place to expedite rent supplement claims for victims of domestic violence.",
                "The Department also administers a number of schemes on behalf of the Department of Justice, Home Affairs and Migration that support persons seeking international protection and beneficiaries of temporary protection. The CWS has a dedicated hub based in Sligo that has responsibility for the processing and maintenance of such claims. Notwithstanding these arrangements, it is important to note that any person may visit his or her local Intreo centre or CWO location and be dealt with there by a CWO if and as the need arises.",
                "There are currently no delays with the processing of SWA payments, including additional needs payments. Nor are there any delays with the issuing of payments. In the year to date, 88% of all basic SWA claims are paid within one week and additional needs payment applications are finalised within ten working days. It is important to note that not all additional needs payment claims involve an urgent immediate need. Most claims relate to help with an upcoming expense and there is usually time for the claim to be considered in the normal way hence the ten working days. However, in cases where a person has an immediate need, every effort is made to ensure he or she receives a payment on the same day.",

My experience over 20 years of working with community welfare officers is that they are very capable people who do their very best to help those who need help at this time.",
                "My first comment is that it must be an oversight that everyone with whom the community service works, other than public representatives, was mentioned in the opening statement. An Garda Síochána was mentioned, as were TLOs. Everybody was mentioned. I work with the community welfare service on a daily basis. That is because the people who come to my office, and I am sure the offices of my colleagues, need help. They need help now more than ever. The witnesses might reflect on the fact that we were not mentioned in the opening statement and that that is where the co-operation is falling down slightly.",
                "I talk to community welfare officers in Kildare South, County Laois and everywhere else I need to talk to them on an almost daily basis when people come to my offices. There is a major issue with paperwork. My problem with the community welfare office as it stands is the centralisation of the service. Ms Haran mentioned hubs for services. Will she tell us how many hubs there are? Does every community welfare officer have a clerical assistant or is that assistance provided through the hubs? Ms Haran also mentioned that the calls service is working very well and that 75% of the people are getting success on it. How many calls were made to community welfare officer services over the past year?",
                "Community welfare offices offer a brilliant service involving funeral expenses. In recent times, we have dealt with so many families who, unfortunately, have had circumstances in which they need help. My understanding is that this is now being centralised to Sligo. I have experience of three, four and five letters going out to families, at the most inappropriate times, looking for information. In some cases, copies of the same letter have gone out two and three times to families. You can just imagine the effect that has on people. The question people are asking relates to what is happening to their information. Previously, I could pick up the phone and talk to the local community welfare officer in order to try to deal with a matter. Now, I cannot because I do not know who is actually dealing with particular matters. Another issue relates to proof of closed accounts for people who are seeking supplementary or exceptional needs payments. When a letter comes back stating that the customer has the account number with whatever three digits it ends in, they have to go to a bank. The bank then informs them there are three to four weeks for a letter to be provided. These people have been put to the pin of their collars looking for help. How can we overcome that problem?"

                "There is a lot of work being done on the ground. Apologies again for the oversight of not mentioning Deputies and other public representatives, particularly in the context of the stakeholder group. Much of the feedback we get regarding the service comes from our stakeholders, including public representatives. We have been reviewing our interaction with our stakeholders. As the Deputy knows, there is a huge amount of work going on with the community welfare service. That is not just around dealing with people face to face. It is the reactive stuff and the proactive piece around going out talking to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, to our partners and to public representatives.",
                "On the review, we have identified that there is a gap in the local knowledge about who the local community welfare officer is and how the service operates now. To that end - the committee is getting a preview now - we are organising a series of events locally for public representatives at Intreo centres in order to introduce people to the service and to the community welfare officers. It is about knowing your local community welfare office and making those contacts. I think that is what Deputy Wall was referring to. Mr. Hand and Ms Goodwin may have some comments in that regard. It is critical.",
                "The community welfare service came to us from the HSE over a decade ago. It came with excellent staff. We were very fortunate when we took on the service that the staff were dedicated, knew their jobs and had a lot of networks built up. Two things have happened. One is natural attrition. People have got older and moved on. People have also changed roles. Individuals have been promoted or retired. As a result, there has been a huge amount of churn in the service.",
                "The second thing that happened - probably during Covid - relates to the outreach piece when people were not as free to move and engage. There is a knowledge gap in that regard that we are very anxious to address. In light of this, we have a series of events planned for the first quarter of 2026. We hope, at the invitation of the Houses, that we will hold an event for everybody here to introduce the services and explain what we do. A huge amount is happening on the ground and is being done centrally. Mr. Hand, Ms Goodwin and the team have done a significant amount of work in reaching out both proactively and reactively. We always have to be there to support people when they need it. We also have to be there on a one-to-one basis. If we lose that, we do not have a service. It is more than that, however. It is about engagement with agencies. I take the Deputy's point. Again, I apologise for not referencing public representatives directly. However, I was waiting for the announcement today that we are going to do that direct engagement. That might be welcome."

I am fully aware of the work that he and his constituency office have done in South Kildare to help people. I remember contacts he made one Christmas Eve in order to help a constituent in need. We went out late in the evening and issued an emergency payment to that person. In recognition of the need for Deputies and Senators to make contact with the service, we have a dedicated public representative contact phone line that operates every day of the week. This is a facility whereby if Deputies or Senators are unable to make local contact, we have a phone line in place whereby they can make contact. The staff who operate that phone line will respond immediately to any contact that is made with them and will try to progress any issue that may be emerging over the course of the day. At the start of every day, we review all the contacts from Deputies and Senators with the service in response to the emerging issues and try to deal with the various cases that arise."

My experience is that CWOs used to be available to meet with members of the public but that is not the case any more. I am frequently contacted by people who find it difficult to access the service.

That is usually in a flashing blue light emergency; it is not every case but it does happen. We have good experience dealing with community welfare services in terms of that. What is causing the delay? If there is no delay in processing, is there a delay in making appointments? There is no delay between the decision to award and the making of the payment. That takes a maximum of ten days. How long does it take, on average, from the point at which a person picks up the phone to the decision being made? The Department refers in its submission to 500 whole-time equivalent staff. Does that represent a full staff and complement at every grade? I note that it does. That is good to know. I am sorry, I was not trying to put words in the witnesses' mouths. I am very interested to know how decisions are made and at what level the power to make those decisions resides.

The person actually gets a cheque. When we look at our figures we can see that of the payments, a third of the first payments people get are actually manual cheques. Therefore, to the Deputy’s question about whether people see our staff in person, it is important to note that is where they get the payment. Again, we could also say that two thirds do not, as I know the Deputy is interested in how that happens. Mr. Hand might speak to that.",

We are redesigning our forms because we have taken feedback from both our customers and the agencies which help customers fill the forms. The forms are one size fits all. A person can apply for an additional needs payment for everything from, as the Deputy said, a funeral to a washing machine breaking down to needing money to travel to a hospital appointment. It has to allow for the person to explain why they need the payment. On the other hand, it is an income-tested or means-tested payment, so we require proof and we have to establish the need. To put that into a succinct form is difficult. It is under review and new forms will be launched in 2026. I hope the Deputy will find those more helpful."

We have been monitoring the applications specifically for fuel or household bills. This year to date, it has very much been on a par with last year. As the Deputy said, we are probably coming into the height of the season for applications over the winter months and coming into the beginning of next year. The number of applications we have received and paid in respect of energy-type bills, like fuel or related household bills, is very much the same as it was in 2024. The percentage of people who qualify, having made an application, is about 60%."

When the crunch point comes then, that is when they have to go in and to prove their cases. All I can ask the witnesses is that the Department be a little more sympathetic to those people because that core of people would not have been into the community welfare office before. They find themselves in this drastic situation. As regards the cost of living, a child or another member of the family could get sick or whatever, and the first thing they have to pay is their mortgage because if they go into mortgage arrears, they are in serious trouble. They go then to the community welfare office. I would like the witnesses to have a chat among themselves to see if we can have a code of sympathy for people like that. I see this growing a little. I am putting it down to the cost of living. The cost of living has gone up, and the mortgage takes precedence. You pay it and then there is only so much left. Then you come into Christmastime or something similar, perhaps you have to travel to hospital or whatever. There is just pressure coming on the family income, and those people deserve to be helped in situations like that. These are genuine people getting into situations like that."

I represent east Galway, and the staff in the Tuam Department of Social Protection offices, in particular, are exceptional. From time to time, when you make that call, you bring them to where that person is to do that face-to-face. I was delighted when Ms Haran said that the face-to-face interaction is of paramount importance and is quite significant. It is. For some strange reason, people who are in dire need think that they have a better chance of succeeding with the face-to-face interaction than with something that is done online or through a paper application. You can sense the relief in them, particularly people who may not be technologically savvy or aware. I suppose a lot depends on the quality of the application for support that comes into the Department. I am sure things are predicated very much on that because very often when they make an application for an exceptional needs payment or whatever the case may be, people miss out on the important thing in their life or their domestic situation that is causing them financial burden. They might not even consider that or put that into an application. As I said, my experience has been good.",

There might be one or two areas that can be queried, however, particularly with regard to older people who are downsizing. When I say downsizing, I refer to people who might have been in a three-bedroom local authority property and they now need to go to, perhaps, a one-bedroom property that has become available. Fifteen years ago, those people would have received the once-off payment for white goods. They might have used, say, €1,500 of it, with only €1,200 left. That is the maximum they can get. They cannot get the full allocation. Just this summer, I had a case where someone was downsizing and while they received a proportion for their white goods, they could not get the last bit. Believe or not, when local authorities are handing over the house, they do not do the flooring either. That was the element we were looking for but we could not get it. History held that funds were used in the past. Maybe that is something the Department is looking at reviewing because when it comes to housing, downsizing and encouraging people out of the three-bedroom house into the one- or two-bedroom house, it would make a huge difference if it were seamless."

I can understand the complicated ones where there is inheritance or a bachelor has let and there is an assessment going on and all of that. At the end of the day, however, the undertaker still needs to be paid. He is the one who is out the money. That is who I look at, namely, the person out the money. I dealt with a hard case involving a lovely Polish lady whose husband died in a horrific car crash where three other people lost their lives. She was here living in social housing, not working with two young children but she still could not get that payment. Maybe the once-off funeral payment is something we can look at. I have a huge file relating to that particular case and I would love the Department to look at it. Those are the minority of cases, however. The majority have been absolutely phenomenal. I have been doing this job for ten years and I have received great support. I just focused on the negative side and that small element.",

For people who receive that unfortunate diagnosis, whether terminal or whatever, once they hear the “c” word, they go into a spin. Has the Department considered working with the Irish Cancer Society to develop a booklet or pamphlet to inform people of their entitlements? Back in the old days with the health boards, such a booklet was available. It was nearly like a patients’ one-stop shop of supports, of which the community welfare service covered a huge part. Has the Department considered or looked at that? Is it open to working on that?"

I can tell the Department about the four undertakers. I would love to know when the Department started communications with funeral directors. We play a valuable role in bringing real-life experiences to the table that can help inform the booklet and inform or shape the policy. We want to help because it ensures that our constituents are front and centre in the needs at their time."

To follow on from what Senator Rabbitte and others have said, the touch point is the public representative. I often describe us as another citizens' information bureau. For some reason, people somewhat prefer to come to us and we provide a good service. I do not want to sound patronising but I would like to think that other Departments could emulate the service that social protection or the old social welfare gives. People can ring up and get the information. As I said in the presence of the Minister recently, if that service were not there, there would be so many people answering parliamentary questions. I remember the days when there were hundreds of parliamentary questions on the Order Paper, whereas now people can lift the phone and information is all very accessible.",

                "In relation to the responsibility that was taken over from the old health boards, such as the funeral grants and the single exceptional needs payments, we forget very quickly about the successful cases. We remember the ones that were not successful. I am only sharing this because I had a case recently of a man who lived until he was well into his 70s. He was physically disabled all his life. God rest his mother who kept him at home until she died. His sister kept him then and eventually he had to go into care for about three years before he died. By God, when I looked for the funeral grant, it was rejected on the basis the sister herself had sufficient money in her account to look after it. They had forgotten that had he been in care and his mother been a bad parent and his sister a bad sister, they would have got it, no problem. I wanted to go as far as I could with it but the family were so proud they would not let me do it. It was some moneys that they should have. I think somebody just took a blinkered view of it. Maybe some time I might, but I am just sharing that about when people look after others. It is the same as children who are being cared for by their parents. If the parents were not caring parents, the children would be in long-term care. Actors like that should be taken into consideration. I am just sharing that with the witnesses.",
                "The other one which I think is very beneficial is the reviews. I am straying away from community welfare but the reviews can be dealt with very quickly but, by God, the appeals. I can understand because there is not a section just dealing with appeals for the carer's allowance, carer's benefit or various others. They are all going into the one appeals office, as I understand it, here in Dublin. I know there has been some improvement on it but it can take a long time. The only advantage of it is, if the appeal is successful, there will be a back payment for another period. If an application goes into the appeals section, it is taking a long time and there is a change in circumstances, is it wise to make a fresh application that might be dealt with quickly? If the application were approved, would it take into consideration the commencement date for the application that is with appeals?"

We have a series of Intreo centres - I think there are 62 - and we have a series of social welfare branch offices, about 60 of them. Of the Intreo centres, 51 have what we call a walk-in service Monday to Friday, 9 to 5. A person can make an appointment but it is what it says, the person can walk into the office and say they would like to see the community welfare officer, they want to make an application or they want some information. Usually what happens is the person comes in and says at the reception of Intreo that they need assistance with something or they have a bill coming up and need assistance with that. They would be given forms, but if they need to see the community welfare officer, they can. As I said, a third of the applications we deal with are paid by cheque in the first instance, so the community welfare officer actually sees the person.",
                "There are an additional 22 locations where we have what we call a part-time service - Ms Goodwin will correct me if I am wrong. We do not have somebody Monday to Friday but they are there on dedicated days. Again I take the Chair's point that that probably needs to be circulated among the public representatives so it is clear on where those people are. I agree that a lot of the old system of having a CWO at lots of various locations for two hours maybe every second week was based around the fact we did not have alternative channels at the time. We did not have an online application. The phone service would not have been as good. A lot of the work at that stage was done around medical card reviews, and the Chair would be aware of that, and back to school clothing and footwear. There were reasons people came in other than to make an application. All of that, thankfully, is dealt with automatically now so people do not need to come and see somebody with all their documents to do a medical card review or apply for the back to school clothing and footwear. That is paid automatically. I suppose it is a balance because it was a way of getting to know people. To the Deputy's point, it is good to see somebody face to face but it can be off-putting. That is why the phone service is so good for us as well because people do not have to identify themselves. I might have an entitlement but I would like to phone anonymously and talk to somebody first before actually coming in and sitting in the Intreo office. That is our experience, that it is welcome, and people say it is great to be able to talk to somebody. It is not replacing the face-to-face contact. All of these things are to complement it, no more than the online application is not to replace that actual face-to-face contact. If someone is at home on a Saturday, they can sit down and rather than filling out a 16-page form, they can go online, send in the form and get a response. That is the idea of it. It is to get the balance right."

I think Ms Haran has heard today that the public representatives have a huge role to play in the service. I think that has been forgotten about, to a certain extent. It was definitely forgotten about in her opening statement. We have established we have a lot to offer to help the service. I know I have spoken to Mr. Hand previously on this. It would be great if we could interact and tick-tack again. I really welcome that the Department will come into us and listen to us.",
                "On the declaration forms, I dealt with five cases in the past two weeks. The declaration form was not mentioned in one case. All five cases looked for the bank account. These are the problems we are having as public representatives. If a declaration form was available, that person, who has not opened that credit union account for 20 years in one case, would have signed it but they are delaying the whole process by not knowing there is a declaration form. That is the type of stuff we need to know. At the end of the day, people are still coming into our offices. They are still engaging with all of the other services mentioned at the start but public representatives are the front line of what these people need. We are the first port of call because we have closed down community advice centres, in the main. It is now public representatives' offices that are getting these queries. To have that information is vital. I really appeal for that.",
                "On the heat supplement that was mentioned earlier, this is almost new to me. I have only come across it in the past number of weeks. Can the witnesses tell us what the heat supplement means for people? As there are 300,000 households in arrears, this is very important. From talking to local community welfare officers, I know they do not want to be a substitute for what Government may or may not be doing. The heat supplement is so important for people who need it at the moment, particularly those with disabilities. That is a main cohort of people who I deal with who need heat. The heat supplement payment is absolutely essential for them.",
                "On the forms and going back to the funeral ones I mentioned before, what I see getting there is a copy and paste form. Sometimes, the box could be ticked and that is the missing information and sometimes, it is not ticked. I can give example after example where some someone comes into me with 14 requests for funeral expenses, even though we have supplied three or four of those funeral expense requests already. This is why I am saying I see the problem with the hubs. If that person forgot to tick they only wanted one of those 14 requests, the person comes in, who has just buried a partner or a loved one, and says to me they are now being asked for 14 requests from them. You can imagine how that is the problem we are having here with those requests. I welcome the fact Ms Haran is looking at these forms again. I appeal to her that the staff, particularly those who are in the hubs, look at the forms that are already there and make sure to tick the boxes only for which they are requesting the additional information. Too often, I have come across that.",
                "Unfortunately, I am coming across more and more domestic violence cases, which is a huge problem. The community welfare officers who I deal with are absolutely brilliant. I have the phone numbers of the central office so I can pick up the phone and talk to it. However, there are times I get a call, be it Saturday night at 7 o'clock, or whenever it is like Mr. Hand mentioned previously in his introduction. Can I suggest a central number for something like that and to have it in an emergency? Is the number that Mr. Hand mentioned earlier the national number? I know I have a local number that I use and it is a brilliant service as well. However, we need a service that is there 24-7 for the increasing number of emergency cases that are coming to us, be it a Friday evening at 6 o'clock or a bank holiday Monday, so we can look at helping those. I agree with that was said at the start that the Department is there to help as many people as possible and I believe that is what it does on a daily basis. I thank the witnesses for it."

One of the pieces I am doing at the moment is reviewing all communications sent out from the hubs. We are doing a quality control piece. I and some of the staff have done a National Adult Literacy Agency, NALA, plain English course, with a view to redesigning all of those. We are hoping to have system-based letters for the hubs in place for 2026 where individual officers will not be able to go in and edit. Instead of taking out the things that were already provided and should have happened in those cases and only asking for what is missing, that will automatically happen when they are putting the application through the system.",

It is specifically for people who have a medical need for extra heating costs. Traditionally, we had two forms. We now just have one form for a customer but it has to be filled in by a GP or consultant. If it is a new diagnosis, we get the customer to fill in the form, set up the heat supplement and review it in three or four months' time based on the next two bills to see if the amount we have given is enough. Another option is that if it is somebody has an ongoing issue and they are coming to us now, we will look at their bills over the previous two months and assess how we can support them with the heating cost. It is separate to fuel allowance, notwithstanding that the fuel allowance has also been increased. More and more people, such as carers, are coming on stream to qualify for fuel allowance.",

As the Deputy rightly said, it is immediate. That is probably a very good example of immediate needs cases. We have dealt with a couple of cases around the country where we have dispatched CWOs at a moment's notice who got into their car and got out to meet the person. It is absolutely, 100% an immediate needs situation.",

Each of those people can, as was said, be in complicated situations and vulnerable situations and have individualised issues and each of them deserves dignity. Just to understand the different dynamics with the additional needs payments, ANPs, there are 54,000 payments but can the officials give me a sense of how many recipients there were in that? What was the number of people who received aid under the human assistance scheme in the each of the two events referenced in the officials' documentation? I would also like to understand what accounts for the difference between those in temporary protection or international protection who get the daily expenses allowance, DEA, versus those who are beneficiaries of temporary protection, BOTPs. There is a difference there of about 7,000 people. I would like to get a sense as well of the success rate with appeals when people appeal certain judgments. I have two other questions but I will leave it there for now."

A person applies and it may be in respect of a household but it is an application under a PPSN. Ms Goodwin is going to keep me on the straight and narrow here. There have been 54,221 additional needs payments to the end of October. The amounts would vary because, as we have said, a household kit-out is a much greater amount than a person needing €100 for a particular need or bill, so there is variation across that.",

It ended up with 58,464 people receiving a payment under stage 1, which is the immediate payment. Another 108 people received a payment under stage 2, which is typically for white goods. In a flooding event you might need to replace the white goods in your kitchen, etc. We have 71 stage 3 claims paid, which are the more substantial ones where we had to have house repairs or there was damage to a property and it needed works to make it habitable again.",

People have entitlements under the material reception conditions for international protection applicants. One of them is that they receive a daily expense allowance, which is €38.80 per adult per week. As part of that they receive a €100 clothing allowance as an additional needs payment, so that is the DEA cohort - the international protection applicants. As for beneficiaries of temporary protection, a person, typically from Ukraine, who is a beneficiary of temporary protection has the same social welfare entitlements as an Irish citizen other than if they are living in what we call designated accommodation. There are people who the State supports. The accommodation is designated and if you are a resident of a designated accommodation centre you are not entitled to social welfare but you are entitled to a weekly payment we also administer. The rates are similar to the international protection daily expense allowance. There are about 2,600 people currently in designated accommodation centres in receipt of the BOTP weekly payment at €38.80. There is a slightly higher amount where people have to pay the cost of their meals. There is a lot of churn in that because people enter the country, are assigned accommodation and then they move out. It stays around 2,500 but it is 2,500 different people.

Some of it is preventative, some of it is proactive and the rest of it has to be reactive because if the person presents what we need to do is respond and react. Ideally we would not be here. I do not mean here in the room but the fewer people who need our services the better for us because it means other things are working well and people's circumstances are good. We have been very proactive in making sure those silos are not there and that there is a lot of engagement. Mr. Hand is driving a lot of that co-ordination so he might want to say few things as well."

At the national level we are keen to make contact with all the relevant actors or players in that space and to meet them and engage with them to educate and communicate with all their key players. We have done that through organising webinars, meetings with volunteers, key workers and all the people involved in that space to try to come out of the shadows and educate and inform them as to what we are about and to speak about the application process. Typically people want to know what we do not fund, what we cannot support, what the barriers are, how the process works and all that. We do it at a national level. At a local level we have staff involved in any committees or meetings of local area groups at the local level across the city. There are multiple groups we meet, though I do not want to name them. We try to be as proactive as we can be within that system, not only with State organisations but also with NGOs and the charity sector - anybody we think is a player involved with us. Then it is at the individual officer level as well and to replicate that down. We really try to be involved in any mechanism whereby the individual community welfare officer can be involved with the crisis intervention. A good example of that is children and young person's CYPSCs, crisis intervention teams where State agencies like Tusla, the Garda and the Probation Service come together to assist a family in crisis.",
                "A community welfare officer would be involved. There would typically be a clinical aspect to that, but there are also financial supports that the community welfare service and officer can bring to the table to help that family in need. Often, it can be small things such as a washing machine or fixing a shower. We want to be in that space. We work closely with the particular charities in that area.",
                "There may be a cocktail of supports. An organisation might come to us to tell us it will do this if we can do that. It is about trying to get back into that space. We are actively encouraging community welfare officers to do home visits so that they understand that going to a person's home and engaging with them is important when it comes to making a decision on that person's claim. As Ms Haran said, they may visit for one purpose, and when they go into a home, they see other things we can provide support with. They can also engage with other players working in that area.",

I am sure that many new Deputies and Senators who have come to the Houses would like to have one for every member of their staff. It is the Bible of social protection. It is a really good document and I could not compliment it enough. It was available to everybody. With the permission of the Chair, it would be great to have the service give a presentation on the booklet in the audiovisual room, in conjunction with what is being developed for those who acquire a disability or receive a diagnosis, such as what is being done with the Irish Cancer Society. We could launch, or relaunch, such booklets and create awareness with the service's partners that are on the front line.",

                "I thank the Cathaoirleach and members of the committee for the opportunity to appear before them. I am the accountable manager and director of search and rescue, SAR, for Bristow Ireland, with responsibility for overseeing the delivery of Ireland’s search and rescue helicopter and fixed-wing operations. I am joined by my colleague, Mr. James Lorraine, a fellow director of Bristow Ireland. As well as holding a senior management position at Bristow Group, Mr. Lorraine is a fully qualified, highly experienced AW189 SAR pilot with many years’ experience in European SAR operations.",
                "Bristow Ireland is honoured to have been awarded the ten-year contract for the delivery of search and rescue services for the Irish State through the Department of Transport and the Irish Coast Guard, IRCG. The delivery of this service is one that comes with tremendous responsibility: for the safety of the Irish people and, equally, for our SAR crews delivering this essential State service. I take this opportunity to state my utmost respect and support for those crews and the broader Bristow Ireland team supporting us.",
                "Bristow is the global leader in search and rescue aviation operations, experienced in saving lives in some of the world’s most challenging environments. We currently operate SAR services for governments and industry in countries, including the UK, Norway, the Netherlands, the USA, Trinidad, and the Dutch Caribbean. We have performed over 31,000 SAR missions worldwide during half a century of exemplary service, saving more than 19,000 people in the process.",
                "To put this in further context, our European SAR operations crews flew a total of 4,303 hours on more than 3,000 emergency taskings this year, rescuing 678 people and bringing urgent aid to a further 900 people in need. Since Bristow’s operations commenced in Ireland last year, more than 300 taskings have been undertaken on behalf of the Irish Coast Guard.",
                "In Ireland, as in every other country, we work to strict operational procedures, requirements and expectations. These are set out in law, defined by regulatory authorities or stipulated within the contract. The services we deliver align with, and are approved by, the Irish Aviation Authority. Our operations are strictly governed by regulators, and our delivery is continuously audited by the Department of Transport against clear contractual requirements.",
                "The IRCG aviation service is currently in a transition phase and, when complete, will see Bristow Ireland operate from bases at Shannon Airport, Weston Airport, Sligo Airport, and Waterford Airport. We work closely with the Department of Transport, the Coast Guard, the Irish Aviation Authority and trade unions at every step. Under this new contract, the Irish SAR fleet will comprise six modern, technologically advanced search and rescue configured AW189 helicopters and, for the first time, two fixed-wing aircraft.",
                "Safety is at the core of everything Bristow does. Our target zero culture means zero harm to people and zero compromise on safety. Every decision we make is driven by this principle. Safety in aviation is achieved through a comprehensive safety management system. This system manages all aspects of safety and, together with our procedures, ensures the highest possible quality of operations and maintenance.",
                "Relating to fatigue specifically, safety is assured through a core component of our safety management system known as the fatigue risk management system, FRMS. FRMS enhances safety with a data-driven, science-based approach, continuously monitoring and managing fatigue-related safety risks, and ensuring personnel maintain required levels of alertness for safe operations. For example, the system includes automatic circuit breakers whereby a base is taken offline to allow the crew to rest and recover from taskings completed during certain time periods. Besides such mandatory protection, Bristow crews are empowered to control their workload in response to any fatigue issues. FRMS is mandated for national coastguard aviation operations and approved by the Irish Aviation Authority. FRMS ensures that any potential fatigue of flight and technical crew is proactively managed on a continuous basis. To summarise, fatigue management is an essential part of safety and, in our operation, is carried out to the highest industry standards. Safety is therefore not at risk.",
                "I turn now to rosters and duty time management for SAR crews, in particular the way working time is recorded and the application of factoring. Our crews are rostered and perform duty in accordance with our approved flight and duty time schemes described in our operations manuals. These specify how crews may be rostered, how much flying time is permitted, and how crew rest may be managed, all to ensure that fatigue is avoided. These procedures are in accordance with O.58, which provides the detailed working time and rest limitations for helicopter crew. Of note, crew duty is limited to 2,000 recordable hours per year and, in accordance with regulation, duty hours are accumulated throughout a shift, whereby hours spent in the crew rest facility overnight are factored appropriately. Factoring is the established process by which aviation operators determine duty time when taking non-flying elements into account. Indeed, factoring is well established in Irish helicopter SAR operations and is common in SAR operations in Europe.",
                "To further clarify the practice of factoring, this refers to overnight crew rest hours between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m. when there is no activity beyond holding readiness for emergency response taskings. During this period, crew are at an extended 45-minute readiness to launch for taskings as opposed to their 15-minute readiness in the daytime. This aspect has been the norm in IRCG helicopter operations for many years. If crew rest and sleep are not interrupted, that is, if there is no call-out during these hours, then 16.5 hours are logged for the shift in accordance with the regulation. If they are called out during standby hours, then the full 24 hours are logged. This arrangement, which is familiar to crews in Ireland as well as in other parts of the world, enables the efficient delivery of safe and effective lifesaving services to the community. Our evidence and data gathered provide us with resounding confidence in the suitability of these practices in Ireland and are further supported by our decades-long experience and evidence from our global safety management systems in other jurisdictions.",
                "In our considerable experience delivering first-class SAR operations, there is no indication across any of our systems to suggest that our flight time and duty practices adversely impact safety.",
                "If there were, we would respond immediately.",
                "Similarly, the requirement stipulated under the contract for crews to remain on base for the duration of their shift is, in our opinion, a positive step towards a safer and more effective service. Remaining on base lowers fatigue and has a generally positive impact on safety while avoiding potential outside factors, such as adverse weather, traffic, car breakdown or defective mobile phones. Any of these elements and more could potentially prevent critical team members from responding to emergency calls in time. Similarly, driving into work with urgency at night detracts from the attention needed to mentally prepare for the tasking at hand and exposes crew to avoidable risk.",
                "In recognition of this, Bristow Ireland is investing in modern, purpose-built accommodation to provide crews with a high level of comfort during overnight hours. These facilities are furnished and equipped to high standards and will ensure crews can rest and recuperate properly overnight. As stated, the priority is always safety. Bristow Ireland ensures the highest safety standards are achieved and our working practices align with the regulation, contract and all relevant legislation.",
                "I assure the committee that Bristow Ireland is committed to delivering a service that is not only safe, reliable and accountable but one which is primed to deliver an ever greater level of emergency response, with new helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft, technology and facilities for our excellent Irish teams. We welcome oversight and engagement and we will continue to work with regulators, unions and communities to uphold the highest standards of safety and transparency. Perhaps at some stage, the Cathaoirleach, along with the committee members, will have the opportunity to visit the bases to see our operations and facilities at first hand. Bristow Ireland would be grateful for the opportunity to welcome them at that time. I thank the committee for the opportunity to attend. We are happy to take questions."

CHC Helicopter records 17 hours and 15 minutes for a 24-hour shift and their crews go home at night, whereas Bristow Ireland logs 16 hours and 30 minutes but its crews are required to stay at company accommodation. Why is Bristow Ireland only recording 16 and a half hours? How is this legal? Who agreed this?"

People in those working conditions are not going to have a dispute or bring matters to attention unless something is wrong, so the fact it has come to this stage makes me question. My first question is similar to one from Deputy Crowe. There seems to be a differential in how factoring is applied between airlines and the rescue service. That is one thing I wish to ask. Is this compliant with EU regulation? I argue it is not. Second, in the context of the new contract, factoring and Aeronautical Notice No. O.58, which Mr. Bartlett spoke about, when will the contract be renegotiated? Who decides this? Who is responsible? If removing factoring is going to make things easier or resolve the current dispute, whose responsibility is it? Is it that of the Minister or the IAA? Where does the buck stop?"

The way it looks to me is that 24 hours are being counted as 16.5 hours, which is not honest. I do not believe it is compliant.

While everyone appreciates what the company's crews are doing, the company also works in an employment law situation and based on European Court of Justice rulings, Irish law, SI 507/2006 and aeronautical notice O.58 the company is out of alignment. I agree with my colleague that safety does matter to the company but it is a new contractor and this is a more commercially efficient way to run things. I would ask the company to treat engineers, flight crews and technical crew at base equally. Finally, I would ask that all of the legal advice, which is so central to what we are talking about here, which is the welfare of workers and the welfare of people the company is dealing with out on site when it flies missions, be furnished to the committee. A report should be produced by this committee and sent to the Minister and the IAA. I am convinced that something has happened here. The company is either compliant with regulation or it is not. If it is not compliant, then there is some correspondence somewhere that we as a committee need to see and need to be furnished with. Whether one calls it lobbying, which would be my terminology, or engagement, which is Mr. Bartlett's terminology, that needs to be furnished to us in the next round of correspondence."

IALPA has a positive working relationship with the operators, which includes industrial relations agreements and collective labour agreements which set out pilots’ pay, terms and conditions. These agreements were referenced in the reply to a parliamentary question, reference number 63061/25, and IALPA can confirm that there are no agreements in place that undermine Irish or European law, especially regarding European working time directives.",

The IAA has statutory responsibility for the regulatory oversight of aviation safety in Ireland and for advising the Minister for Transport and the Government in this regard.",

They are now required to be on base for a full 24-hour shift, which is a new requirement of the Coast Guard introduced to reduce the amount of time required to get an emergency helicopter airborne and to reduce fatigue. With this change, a method of factorisation is being used for the purpose of recording and logging pilot hours, thereby reducing the actual hours worked to a reduced amount of time being recorded. This has a detrimental effect on the recording of the pilots’ hours for the purpose of flight time limitations, FTLs, the EU working time directive and, therefore, safety.",

Article 22 of the order states, \"Airport or heliport standby will count in full for the purpose of calculating cumulative duty [hours].\" This is also in line with international best practice and civil aviation norms. The reason this type of duty or work hours is recorded in full and not factorised is the pilot is in the workplace when on standby and it is normal to record all time in the workplace as actual work or duty hours.",

In 2022, the IAA further published aeronautical notice O.76, which mandated operators of specialised operations to fully comply with the provisions set out in the previous notice O.58, while also allowing an operator to vary the flight time limits should it implement an FRMS allowing for a 24-hour operation. The purpose of fatigue risk management systems is to promote safety and make the operation safer than prescriptive flight time limitations. An FRMS should never be used for the purpose of increasing pilot work hours or reducing their rest, but the opposite, to establish a system that ensures pilots, when at work, are not fatigued and are well rested. With the FRMS approved by the IAA for the Irish Coast Guard service, we have seen the tool being used to allow for the reduced recording of work hours not allowed under previous flight time imitation schemes.",
                "There is no provision in law for a fatigue risk management system to amend or propose changes to the requirements set out in Directive 2000/79/EC, which details how working hours are recorded for pilots, nor for the Irish Aviation Authority to approve or allow such changes. The directive stipulates that the maximum annual working time for any pilot shall not exceed 2,000 hours, during which the block flying time shall be limited to 900 hours. There is no possibility of factorising hours or reducing the actual working time to suit an employer or regulator. In 2010, the then chief Coast Guard officer approached the Minister for Transport requesting the Department give an exemption from Directive 2000/79/EC to the then operator of search and rescue services for the purpose of recording work hours for search and rescue pilots. This request was denied, and our understanding is that the then Minister did not believe the State could undermine or interfere with the European directive on a point of law. It is disappointing 15 years later to learn that the same stringent oversight is not being applied and an FRMS has been approved by the IAA that appears not to be in line with existing legislation or the spirit of enhancing safety."

I am assistant general secretary with responsibility for the IAESA branch and for our members in it, the technical crew, who are winchmen and winch operators, as well as paramedics and advanced paramedics. I am joined by Mr. Everitt, who works as a technical aircrew winch operator and winchman paramedic. He has more than 28 years’ experience in his role.",
                "The four keys points we will raise today concern the search and rescue, SAR, aircrew at Shannon and Weston airports who are currently required to remain on site for 24-hour duty periods, starting at 1 p.m. and finishing at 1 p.m. the following day under an immediate readiness model. Aircrew based in Sligo and Waterford will transition to this same model on 1 February 2026. Until September 2025, SAR personnel were permitted to return home during duty periods, provided they lived within 20 minutes of the base.",
                "The distinction between immediate readiness and standby is central to understanding this change. Immediate readiness requires the aircraft to be airborne within 15 minutes in certain situations. To meet this requirement, all technical and flight crew must remain physically at the base for the duration of the shift. Standby, by contrast, involves a longer permissible response time.",
                "Crews may wait for a tasking from their homes or other appropriate location and are not required to remain on base. The second point is that the fatigue risk management is a scheme designed to help identify and reduce fatigue among SAR crews. Here, we argue that it is being misused by the IAA to factor the working hours of search and rescue crews. Both EU and Irish law clearly indicates that time spent at work is working time. Recent EU case law from 2021 reinforces this mainstay of workers’ rights. Finally, current IAA regulations seek to classify the on-duty pilots and technical crew as standby personnel for a portion of their continuous 24-hour shift and allow factoring of working hours that are otherwise defined as full working time under legislation. This misapplication of standby regulations and ignoring of working time legislation has resulted in the repeated under-recording of actual working time as defined by law.",
                "It is important to note that from the very beginning of our engagement with Bristow, we were clear that technical crew would not accept any factoring of their hours, that is, recording fewer hours than those worked, which is done in order to allow the operator to continue to roster workers for duties when they have breached their 2,000 hour limit of recorded hours, otherwise known as clock hours, while technically remaining compliant with European Aviation Safety Authority, EASA, and Irish Aviation Authority regulations. Members of the committee should be aware that the size of the disparity between worked hours, the clock hours, and recorded flight hours can potentially be enormous and possibly up to 800 hours in a year. This depends on the pattern of call-outs during immediate readiness time period from 10 o'clock at night to 8 o'clock in the morning, however.",
                "Generally, we have developed a positive working relationship with Bristow Ireland – save for this one critical issue. Having raised our objections to factoring, Bristow management was unequivocally clear with its position. It would utilise factoring, despite our protestations and arguments against it. It even went so far as to confirm that should any of our members refuse to work more than 2,000 hours, they would be immediately subject to the full rigours of Bristow's disciplinary process. The critical issue here is that despite Fórsa’s best efforts in attempting to resolve the issue, Bristow relies on the legal protection afforded to them by the IAA to operate in a commercially profitable way. This is done at the expense of our members’ welfare. Technical crew are happy to work overtime when it is by mutual consent. They are also flexible and happy to adhere to all of Bristow’s other operational rules and procedures. However, given the dangerous and kinetic nature of their work, being able to spend their personal time away from duty is of paramount importance for them. This is a matter of fairness and workers’ rights to have existing law applied fairly to them.",
                "In short, factoring crew hours allows the operator to roster staff for additional time beyond 2,000 hours. The employer seeks to justify this by relying on having a fatigue risk management system, FRMS, in place. An FRMS is required to allow operators to deviate from the standard 12-hour shift and instead operate 24-hour shifts. It should have nothing to do with justifying the recording of reduced hours. Our members have expressed serious concerns that FRMS is being misused and misapplied. In summary, the solution to this issue is potentially a simple one. If the IAA is directed by the Minister to mandate all operators to adhere to the spirit and intent of the EASA regulations, mindful of compliance with several relevant case law examples, and to properly record all worked hours as elapsed hours, the issue would be immediately resolved."

When Deputy McGuinness asked his questions, he was told unequivocally and categorically there is no change to working hours, everything is the same and nothing has changed here at all. For me, I got the grain of truth at the end because we heard from Bristow that its crewing levels are determined by factoring. If factoring determines crew levels, if you removed factoring, you would require more crew. There is more cost for the company. There is a commercial decision central to all of this. I can tell you one thing: when any of us here phone 999 or see something out at sea, or someone has fallen down a ravine, I do not want a yellow-pack search and rescue service. I want one that is properly paid, looked after when they are at base and one whose stress levels are not through the roof when they are at home. That is the search and rescue service I want. What I heard at the end was if you join the dots, you make a circle. There is a commercial decision at the heart of this here.",
                "I have a specific ask. On foot of what Deputy McGuinness suggested earlier, and I second it, I have an ask of the committee. Aeronautical notice O.58 is what governs a lot of this here. Something has changed that has allowed those hours to be exceeded. Something has changed and things like this do not just get dreamed up. There is some correspondence trail. I want the committee to formally seek, and hopefully it will be seconded, that before the IAA comes in, this trail of correspondence is furnished to us. Something has happened here that has utterly transformed how our search and rescue bases work and how their hours are factored. I ask that correspondence be sought and furnished to us in its entirety beforehand.",
                "Finally, I note this went before the WRC before but it was bounced asked as an aviation regulatory issue. It is not. It is a workplace. I am only one member of this committee but in my opinion, there are breaches of EU and Irish work law. That belongs in the WRC. Maybe Kieran Mulvey or someone could come in here and mediate. Maybe it needs to go directly to the WRC but I also suggest that be a formal suggestion from this committee, as in its current kicking over and back, it is not going any place fast. Those are two suggestions I formally make.",

I have one last question and I encourage Mr. Everitt to use all the time he has, at the Cathaoirleach's discretion. Fórsa circulated correspondence. Attachment No. 3 was an old email that said everything had to be brought within this 2,000 hour work limit. What has changed?

                "Good morning and I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak here today. I have been in search and rescue for 28 years. My first five years were in the Defence Forces. I joined CHC in 2002. In 2002, my contract stated my working hours would be arranged when I arrived on base. At that time, my 24-hour working shift was calculated at 18 hours and 45 minutes. In that, from 9 o'clock at night until half 7 in the morning, those hours were counted as 50% time. That lasted until about 2010 when some of our search and rescue aircrew actually breached the 2,000 hour limit. You can imagine the amount of work you have to do to breach the 2,000 hour limit, even though your hours are being factored. The Irish Aviation Authority actually closed the base for a period of time because of it.",
                "To rectify this, the Irish Aviation Authority gave CHC permission to use a new flight time limitations, FTL, scheme. That FTL scheme quartered our time for the first six hours, from 9 o'clock at night to 3 a.m., so every hour you worked was only counted as 15 minutes, and halved it again. I went from 18 hours and 45 minutes to 17 hours and 30 minutes. They also gave a further permission to backdate that for an entire year. I was at 1,920 hours. Overnight, I went to 1,710 hours. That was across all four bases immediately.",
                "From 2010 onwards, we were on quarter time, half time, while on immediate readiness. That is another thing I would like to talk about; the stand-by method terminology. We are on immediate readiness. When the phone goes, you get an immediate response - 15 minutes by day to airborne and 45 minutes by night. You then travel forward to the new contract where the contractor has to comply with the request for tender from the Government through the Department of Transport. It deems we must stay on base at night.",
                "We must stay on the base at night. With that in mind, through our union we said that if we are staying on base, we are physically at work. Conversations were had with Bristow during our negotiations and it was 24 for 24 all the way through to June 2025. Then, almost overnight, it was a case of no, we are factoring. Now my working day has gone from 17 hours and 30 minutes to 16 hours and 30 minutes and I am on the base for 24 hours. That is the small history lesson as to how we have descended and it has been eroded from-----"

As Chair of the Oireachtas Committee on Fisheries and Maritime Affairs and as a lifelong trade unionist, I feel this in both senses. It is a workers' rights issue and it is also about safety. It is about the safety of the crew and it is about the safety and well-being of the people they are tasked to respond to.

I think it is very clear and I think Mr. Everitt hit the nail on the head. This is a commercial contract. This is about cost. The operator here is doing what a commercial operator will always do; it will prioritise a margin for itself as otherwise it would not be entering into contracts of this nature. However, it is for the Government and the regulator to balance the natural and legitimate demand of a private operator to seek more profit for its shareholders with the public good and I do not think that is happening here.",

That was something we had to engage in. There was a disagreement between me and a member of management in Bristow in that we are counting hours as elapsed hours, clock hours if you like. Bristow was saying that there is a different number for our members of technical crew. I asked what happens when we get close to that flight time limit, FTL, of 2,000 hours. I was told in no uncertain language that they would be subject to the full rigours of disciplinary process, which one can only imagine would be up to and including dismissal.

If that were the case, though, then surely the Department of Transport would not have been invited to make observations and become involved in the review of aeronautical notice O.58, such as it is. My understanding is that this is a very limited review.

The best way to explain my day is probably to look at yesterday when I handed over to the duty crew at 12.45 p.m. They have now been on duty for on or about 23.5 hours. They have another hour and a half to go and they are hoping they do not get a call out, and that is in every base across the country automatically right now. In Weston, Waterford, Shannon and Sligo, they have all been on duty for 23.5 hours. Once crew members go on duty, they take the aircraft and the responsibility over, and it is a responsibility. Their day is determined by various things, including checks and a flying programme. We all need to fly and to stay proficient. We fly by day and by night. At the same time, we always live under the tasking agency, which can at any moment, day or night, call us for anything, for absolutely anything. In my 28 years, I thought I had seen everything, but I actually have not seen everything. As we go through our 24-hour day, like the Cathaoirleach said in the earlier session, it is 24 hours and you do feel it. Yes, we go and rest. Yes, we go to sleep. It is not your sleep, though. We are on a phone provided by the company. We are in accommodation provided by the company. We are on a radio provided by the company. The moment that radio goes off, we are up and moving to whatever. We are an unscheduled service; we do not know what we are going to. The reason it is 45 minutes at night, for example, is that we have to wake up. There is sleep inertia.",
                "In the current contract, we stay on base. There are two bases that go home. I think the contractor, the Irish Coast Guard and the Department of Transport changed that. It was changed based on a recommendation or review following the Rescue 116 crash. That is why that was changed. That is why we stay on base now. Once we are up and moving when a call comes in, we are planning immediately. There is an immediate response, so we do not own our day. We do not own any minute of the day. We are always on call. It does not matter whether we are in the aircraft, at the base or at the accommodation. We can be doing checks or whatever. Once we go in, that is us for 24 hours. As the principal response agency in the country, we are the only emergency service that does 24-hour duties. The 24-hour model of duty is a good model of duty considering that FRMS has been brought in to justify 24 hours, and not to justify factoring. So, that is a 24-hour shift. When we go in, that is it. Where we end up is not up to us. When we go is not up to us. We have some control over when we fly. We plan to fly. We plan to fly by day or by night or to do it in the morning. We may have stakeholder engagements, with members of the Coast Guard, for example. We work with all the other principal response agencies in the country, including the fire service, An Garda Síochána, the ambulance service, north and south of the Border. We can plan those, but sometimes we plan them and they go out the window because we are going out on a call. That is the 24-hour duty."

What we were offered instead was something like TUPE. We were told there would be an agreement. Bristow would broker an agreement with us that would cover all the other features proved by TUPE, but not TUPE itself, which is a strange and bizarre approach to take from our point of view but we had to work with it. That delayed matters quite significantly. As I said, through a tremendous amount of work with Mr. Everitt and the other representatives, we have resolved nearly all the issues, save for this particular matter. From the very outset, literally from day one when we met Bristow initially, we were clear that factoring was not something we were going to accept and nor could we accept it. The company was silent on it until it had the confirmation from, I am assuming, the IAA that it would be able to utilise this particular scheme. In one sense, who can blame Bristow? There is a commercial decision. It is not a charity. It is a significant contract to have with the State for a long period of time, so of course the company is going to try to maximise the benefit to its own shareholders, as was mentioned here earlier."

Regulations matter to pilots. We comply with them in all forms in what we do when we fly. What is really important to highlight is that morale is quite low on this particular point. A change took place, and that was a change in the contract. It is also important to highlight how factorisation comes in and how it came about. Factorisation is a long-standing norm in civil aviation and special flight operations whereby pilots are on standby at home. It recognises that people are at home where they get better sleep and can go about their business. When the change took place, and the Government and the Irish Coast Guard mandated that pilots be on base for 24 hours, we welcomed it with the full understanding that the operator would follow the regulation, which is O.58. This specifically states that if someone is on heliport or airport standby, which they are, it counts in full for duty hours. It is just like airline pilots. If they are sitting at the airport, they are on full duty hours. We had this change in the contract with the introduction of the requirement to stay on base for 24 hours. It was then somehow it was realised that there was a problem with the hours and that the number of crew would need to be increased.

There is an email that is referenced as attachment No. 3. It relates to CHC reduced working hours and was sent on 22 March 2010. It states explicitly that with immediate effect, all CHC Ireland aircrew shall adhere to a maximum duty time of 2,000 hours per annum. That was deemed to be safe and best practice at the time. Something has changed radically since then. I would say that was when a new contract came in. The move from CHC to the new contract provider, Bristow, allowed people to do a bit of a reset. There was a contract negotiation and there was over-and-back. Subsequent to that, there was engagement or lobbying - I call it lobbying, and they will call it engagement - and basically the FRMS, which Captain Tighe referred to, is now being used as a way to override Irish and EU law. Will the witnesses expand on that? Will the be more specific as to how this breaches domestic and European law. During their presentation, they referenced a European Court of Justice case involving a Dutch or German fire service where there was an attempt to bring this in. Will they elaborate on that?",
                "Perhaps if we have time, IALPA can answer my next question. It seems that some of this change belongs in the sphere of commercial civil aviation, with airlines and pilots having to go out in the morning and factoring hours for them. Has a solution for this sphere been applied it to the unpredictable world of search and rescue? When I hear of fatigue, low morale and staff not being treated right, it worries me. It worries me at a human level and because these helicopters take off at speed and at night to get to the most precarious and dangerous situations. We want the pilots and people like Mr. Everitt to be at their very best when they take off. I am sure they are at their best, but it is a strain. That is obvious."

At that time, the IAA wrote to CHC to tell it that. The latter is the email Deputy Crowe is referring to. The legislation on mobile workers clearly states the 2,000 hours have to be spread evenly throughout the year. People cannot do 200 hours one month and 100 hours the next. It has to be spread evenly. What we see now is that if someone does nine shifts in month, which is 216 hours, it is clearly over the limit of 190. It also does not apply the 2,000 hours equally throughout the year. Deputy Crowe asked what can we do about it. We are very clear that this is European law. We are already in the early stages of the transfer. If the 2,000 hours is breached for our members, however, we will go to the WRC and the Labour Court on points of law. It will be disappointing if we have to do this because this is a function of the State. Although the IAA is a regulating the service, the Department of Transport has oversight of the IAA."

For my colleagues who are still on the old contract sitting at home, that should be counted as full working time. They are at home but they can do nothing other than to sit and wait for that call. This is clear under European Union law in three cases. One was a decision of a Belgian court which was brought to the European Court of Justice. The second case was in Germany, where an on-call fire service had to be somewhere within 20 minutes.

That culture is being undermined. The crews are being asked to undermine their own culture and they are being asked to do things that are unsafe. I do not think that is good and it does not bode well for the service. It is obviously having an impact on the well-being and morale of the personnel. I also fear it will have a knock-on impact on recruitment and retention, the availability of the service and its capacity to be sustainable and to survive. This is all because a commercial operator, effectively, does not want to recruit sufficient staff. I would be interested in knowing and hearing from both IALPA and Fórsa how many additional personnel in both sections they think it would take for Bristow to be able to provide the full level of service within the 2,000 hour limit-----"

It appears to be just a straightforward commercial decision to do so. This is notwithstanding the fact that we do have agreements with them. We do. But this still remains an issue and it is something which is absolutely solveable, in our view. It is something that the Minister can intervene on, and on which the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, can provide the clarity required."

Reflecting on my notes, obviously the committee will further engage, including with the Minister. The Minister will be before the committee before the end of January. The IAA will be here in early January. Today's session has really prepared us well for that engagement. There are a number of key follow-ups from today for additional information that we will request from Bristow. We will write to it on the legal advice underpinning some of its decisions. Clearly there is real disagreement in how crews feel that their hours, rest and well-being are being respected. The extent to which crews are being overstretched is really concerning. They personally feel that they are being undervalued. The public must have confidence that the people flying these crucial and important missions, which often result in the saving of lives, are crews that are rested, alert and, most important, supported.",

                "I thank the Cathaoirleach. Good morning everybody. It is a great pleasure to be able to join members today. As the Cathaoirleach said, I have been here before. The genesis of that arrival, which was about ten years ago, was a phone call from Martin McAleese who wanted to know if I was aware that no unionist leader had ever engaged formally with any part of the Leinster House operation. I was not aware of that but we put it right with the appearance in front of this committee. I was glad to do that. Obviously, that was a party political appearance. This time, I am here as an Executive minister. I cannot separate myself from the fact that I am as wedded to the 1998 agreement, both personally and politically, as I was at the time. Actually, at the time I was a broadcast journalist. I spent interminable hours in the car park of Castle Buildings where the negotiations were under way. If I had been told then that I was going to end up in an office on the fifth floor of that building, some 30 steps away from the famous room where the deal was done on 10 April that year, I would have invited you to a random drug test. Such is life, and that is where I find myself today.",
                "I will begin by saying what I said in the Northern Ireland Assembly when I first spoke as Minister of Health. It is something I have said at meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council and at one-to-one meetings with the Minister, Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill, that is, that I have no ideological or political objection to further health co-operation between the two jurisdictions, in fact, quite the opposite. When we go to the Border for health meetings I discover that the Border is not defining difference but actually showing the similarities and challenges that are absolutely equal in both jurisdictions. I am always willing to explore cross-Border collaboration, particularly where there is a clear population health need and where we can do it in a sustainable, long-term manner. When it comes to health and well-being, doing what is right is my main priority.",
                "From the start, my mantra has been better outcomes for patients, service users and the glorious people who deliver health and social care. Given that health services in countries throughout Europe are under pressure, some to an extreme degree, it makes sense that we work together in a mutually beneficial way to improve those outcomes, North and South. Let us not forget our shared experience of Covid-19, which underline the importance of North-South co-operation and relationships. The next pandemic, and there will be a next pandemic, will be no respecter of borders or boundaries. Having said that, it should not come as a surprise to members that when I talk about cross-Border co-operation I do so firmly in the context of two jurisdictions. We could spend the hour debating the merits of a single all-island, all-encompassing health and social care service, and I am well aware some members would be keen to advance that; however, my feeling is that it would be more profitable to focus on those individual health issues where there is a consensus around co-operation. When it comes to co-operation I am happy to do more when it leads to those better outcomes.",
                "The main official channel for cross-Border co-operation is, of course, the auspices of the North-South Ministerial Council, NSMC, and my department works hard to further cross-Border co-operation in that space. The next sectoral meeting is scheduled for 14 January. One of the key aims will be the formal ministerial sign-off of a revised work programme. The Minister, Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill, and I have already told our respective officials that we are content to approve it. The revised work programme groups potential areas for cross-Border co-operation under three main themes: acute services; health inequalities and population health; and the future of healthcare. It is intended to offer a high-level framework for identifying key health priorities for co-operation. It will be a living document. Detail and emphasis will be updated, as necessary, according to ministerial priorities at subsequent NSMC meetings.",
                "I will highlight two areas that come under the future of healthcare theme. The first is digital and data. The starting point for this is the patient. Ensuring sound foundations in digital systems and data are at the heart of transforming the delivery of our health and care system. They provide patients with modern and sustainable services and improve the working lives of our workforce. They are also fundamental to ensuring we can provide services as efficiently and economically as possible. Many of our patients access services in the other jurisdiction, whether for specialist services, such as cancer or paediatric cardiac surgery, or general hospital services such as maternity care or attendance at an emergency department. It is likely the necessity for such cross-Border services will increase in the future, so it is vital that we quality-assure the delivery of these services by ensuring there is a free flow of data between our healthcare systems, taking into account relevant data protection legislation and the requirements of the European health data space regulations.",
                "Officials from both jurisdictions have developed excellent working relationships. During the pandemic, liaison between our care systems enabled the rapid deployment of digital apps to support citizens, the development of systems to enable track-and-trace activities limiting the spread of the virus, and, critically, ensuring that systems were in place to support the administration and management of Covid vaccination. Such work will continue and will be a key part of the health programme going forward.",
                "The second area I will mention is that of genetics and genomics. Genomics is one of the fastest growing fields in modern medicine. I believe we ought to work closely as neighbours to harness the potential of genomics and personalised medicine for the benefit of our patients and health systems. We should take advantage of our unique island-wide skill base, engaging with stakeholders, including our citizens, to advance research, discovery, innovation and implementation. My officials will be happy to meet with HSE colleagues to explore opportunities for collaboration in this area, potentially around shared clinical pathways, a common genomic test directory and cross-Border sharing of genomic data, to support further progress towards embedding this medicine in the delivery of healthcare for our respective populations.",
                "It is all about better outcomes for patients, families, service users and our workforce.",
                "There are, of course, challenges in cross-Border working, and I will illustrate this with reference to the ongoing co-operation between the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service and the National Ambulance Service. In recent months, both have made steady progress in strengthening joint arrangements for cross-Border emergency response under the North-South specialist ambulance response programme. A joint governance structure is now in place, with regular operational meetings, shared action logs and aligned escalation arrangements. Common incident management procedures have been agreed, including the use of shared terminology and updated control room protocols. Initial joint training has been delivered for commanders and call handling staff.",
                "Work is progressing on harmonising clinical and operational procedures, updating the memorandum of understanding on mutual aid and improving control room interoperability. However, two regulatory issues are impeding progress, those being, temporary professional registration for cross-Border working and the carriage and use of controlled drugs. These remain under discussion at policy level, with both bodies supporting the work through operational evidence and risk assessment. We remain committed to addressing such obstacles to operation, but we cannot just ignore them or pretend they are always easily addressed. That is the reality.",
                "Another reality is that my Department's budget is under immense pressure, and it will be for the foreseeable future. That inevitably means we are not always able to do everything we would wish to. That can in itself be a driver for closer cross-Border co-operation, for example, to benefit from efficiencies of scale, but it also requires us to prioritise, and it is not always the case that priorities will coincide. However, I want to leave the committee with the message that, in spite of any differences or difficulties, my Department and I remain committed to continuing and developing cross-Border co-operation, not only with the Minister for Health, Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill, but also with the Minister for children and disability, Deputy Norma Foley, and others.",
                "In conclusion, I thank committee members again for the opportunity to be with them today, and I look forward to our discussion."

I wish to go to a couple of the key issues they spoke about. One was the necessity to include the population of the island as a whole to form the critical mass for clinical trials. The benefits of this are obviously not just confined to the innovative advancements in medicine. It also allows us to compete internationally for foreign direct investment. What is the Minister doing, or what can he do, to ensure that happens and what, in his opinion, needs to be done to enable it to happen?",

However, there will be areas, such as rare cancers, where a bigger population would be needed, and that is where an all-island approach makes sense. We in Northern Ireland are missing a trick to a certain extent in terms of clinical trials. It is not that we do not do them, and when we do do them, they are very successful, but we could do more. I been speaking to people. There is a very good professor at Queen's University, Professor Ian Bruce, who came to us from Manchester. He is all across this and understands exactly the benefits of exploiting clinical trials for the benefit, not just of the health system, but of patients. To put it crudely, if a person is in a clinical trial, the health service may be providing them with a higher class of medication without even having to pay for it. What is not to like about clinical trials?",
                "As the Deputy knows, we have now gone live across the five geographically defined trusts in Northern Ireland with the encompass system, which is for electronic patient records. That is now bedding in. It has been in a couple of the trusts for well over a year, so they are well-advanced. The last two trusts only came onboard on 8 May of this year, so they are still getting used to it. It is interesting. When I visit some healthcare settings, I ask somebody who is checking patients in what they think and it can be quite negative because they are not used to it yet. However, some of the clinicians will stop work, turn to me and say that they have worked in the health service for 20 years and it is the best thing that has ever happened. On my phone, I have the My Care app, which has all my stuff. I get the appointments, results and blood tests. It is remarkably efficient and just very comforting to have.",

We need to bring forward what would probably be a single-clause piece of legislation to fix an issue we have with the sharing of secondary information. However, that is for within Northern Ireland. In terms of doing it on an all-island basis, we would obviously be dealing with European legislation. I am not sure if Mr. Wilkinson is across that, but I will give him a moment.",

There are technicalities to work through, but it is clearly an issue.",

That is something we can provide learning from as to how that works and how effective it can be. The second element is the exploitation of data. That means using the systems we have to better provide digital enhancements and improve the service. The third area is one we referenced, that being, looking at some of the barriers that will stop particular information flow.

That is something that has benefited in terms of providing additional capacity for needs within the health system here, but also in terms of using and keeping our capacity to teach and learn that number of medics.",

We are working very closely on that. We are working collaboratively on training places and joint training and on addressing the qualifications issues.

The services are very much appreciated. They are not what we would like them to be because there are always constraints and where there are constraints, we are playing second fiddle. We understand that but we would like to make improvements. We are maybe inclined differently, as in the Six Counties versus the Twenty-six Counties. Problems along the Border are not that simple from my perspective. We need to change the blueprint because the area covers 11 counties, not six. Over a third of the island is the problem child when it comes to health and a whole lot of other issues. We need to start to realise the area is that big, one third of this island, because all the Border counties in the South are as badly affected. We are all fighting for services and closer to the Border, we get the lesser end of the services. That is where collaboration is all the more important. I have been in Daisy Hill Hospital with Justin McNulty a number of times. He had the previous Minister down there. There are so many opportunities along the Border to have centres of excellence in different areas. It does not have to all be just one centre. We should start moving them around. Is there any sign of collaboration from that perspective between the Minister and the Minister, Deputy Carroll MacNeill, or is there a possibility of doing that in future?"

I am as guilty as anybody, having grown up basically in the shadow of one of our acute hospitals, the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald. I expect it to do anything I want in terms of health delivery. Whatever the procedure is, I want it to be doing it, but of course you cannot have an acute hospital at the end of every street. We are trying to condition people and educate them to think about hospitals as a network. With a very high percentage of people, if you tell them what they need is done once a week in their local facility but 30 miles away it is done ten times a day five days a week, they will say they want to travel. Again, the Border does not have to be an obstacle to saying there is a set of centres of excellence in Northern Ireland and then a parallel set of centres of excellence in the Republic. Paediatric cardiac surgery is an example. Jointly, we are having a huge issue with paediatric pathology. I think there is a global shortage of specialists in that area. We are sending patients to England, which is far from ideal. I think to begin with some people were choosing to fly, but someone who has just lost a baby could find themselves in the middle of a stag or hen party going to England for the weekend. Once people get to Liverpool, they get a first-class service but the situation is far from optimal. A solution on this island, wherever that may be, would be great. I spoke to Stephen Donnelly about this when he was health Minister and I have spoken to the current Minister. I think officials are still looking at that. That idea of having centres of excellence is the future, not just in terms of efficiency and value for money but in terms of the best outcomes for people. Does that answer the Senator’s questions?"

When we look at the work that was done in Altnagelvin and the cross-Border element, it has been a success. It treats people from Senator Blaney’s area of Donegal. We have those hospitals on both sides. I add the caveat that I am all for centres of excellence but we do not want to see too many on one side of the Border and too many on the other. I understand Enniskillen hospital is not operating to its full potential. The Minister’s colleague, Diane Armstrong MLA, would be on to me to try to get that. We have Daisy Hill Hospital in Newry, Monaghan hospital, the Louth hospital in Dundalk and Cavan hospital.",

Going forward, as was said, when the population here and the Northern Ireland population are added together, that number may attract the top professionals to come and base themselves in Ireland. If they base themselves along the Border in the hospitals, it would be good for the population as it would allow us to get those high-end units into the Border area. For people in other parts of Ireland, Dublin is the big centre and nobody minds going to Dublin for a major operation but it would be great if clusters could happen along the Border.",

They are coming from all parts of Ireland. Bus tours are going up weekly. It shows that is happening. I have heard of people coming from Northern Ireland to Dublin on the same reciprocal scheme. It is moving in the right direction, but we need to speed it up and get to a point where we will have centres of excellence dotted along the Border. That can be achieved with a bit of work. I commend the Minister on his attitude to getting there, as he said in his opening statement.

As a result, you will still need all of the infrastructure right the way up to acute hospitals. The ambition is that those acute hospitals become less busy because by the time you get into one, it is normally to undergo a very expensive procedure.

That is a good foundation from which to look at development into the future.

We have had a process happen in the South whereby we consolidated or closed hospitals. This happened in Dundalk and Monaghan along the Border and, very much, in the mid-west around Limerick, which has led to enormous pressure being placed on other hospitals. I understand that emergency surgery no longer happens at Daisy Hill, Enniskillen and Causeway. That is leading to significant pressure on Craigavon Area Hospital. Last week, people had to wait up to 19 hours in the accident and emergency department in Craigavon for treatment. There were 40 ambulances stuck in hospital car parks on one particular day as their crews tried to get patients into those hospitals. The delays were caused by the pressure on those hospitals. There is a need for centres of excellence and hospitals with staff who are skilled in deal with issues relating to heart disease, trauma and stroke - the very high end of health - but there is also a need for emergency departments and emergency surgery for grannies with pneumonia who make up the majority of those who go through smaller hospitals and emergency departments.

She was a 42-year-old woman who lived in Newry and who died as a result of lymphoma cancer. She was forced to go to London for treatment, even though the travel was very hard on her because of her ill health, and despite the services being available in the South. We need to get to a situation where there is almost a right for people on both sides of the Border to obtain treatment on either side of it if the relevant service exists. While there is great work happening in Altnagelvin, the majority of people in Donegal still go to Galway for their cancer treatment. That is my second question.",

I have asked the trust to come up with a vision for the South West Acute Hospital because it does an awful lot more than emergency general surgery. That has become a focus for the population.

However, we are also looking critically at discharge and what we can do to have those community packages in place that allow people who are medically fit to be discharged to be sent home. More long term, in terms of our shifting left, we want to look at how much care we can give in the community to avoid those people attending emergency departments, particularly our elderly population for whom the emergency department might not be the best place to receive such care."

He might be aware of the report published by the ESRI earlier in the year entitled Economic overview of Ireland and Northern Ireland. It found some very worrying disparities in health outcomes between the two jurisdictions. Waiting lists are longer, infant mortality rates are higher and life expectancy is shorter for those living in the North. This committee has heard that health outcomes for people from marginalised communities or disadvantaged groups are significantly worse. Has the Minister’s Department considered commissioning a joint mapping exercise for health data across the island using universal metrics in order that we could identify interventions that would have the greatest impact across the island?",
                "Over the summer, the Minister introduced the Adult Protection Bill in the Assembly. This is something really close to my heart and a topic I have dedicated a lot of my time in politics to. How is this Bill progressing? Has the Minister considered undertaking work on an all-island basis to create a universal culture of adult safeguarding which is vital? If not, does he think there is merit in doing so?"

The difficulty is the implementation because we do not have the budget to go straight to full implementation of that Bill. We have made clear, frustratingly, that it will be implemented in stages as the funding becomes available. I had the first-day brief and because health is so broad it seemed to last about six weeks. The one that really jolted me and stuck with me was health inequalities. Two babies born today, particularly two females, in one of the maternity units in Belfast could grow up in the city perhaps a mile or less apart, one in the area of the greatest deprivation and one in the least, for example, the Malone Road and Sandy Row, which are less than a mile apart. Their healthy life expectancy currently varies by over 14 years - in a First World country a quarter of the way into the 21st century. I do not even understand how we tolerate that. I have made it an ambition. We picked two areas of deprivation, one in Derry and one in Belfast, which we call demonstration areas because I wanted to demonstrate that we could get results. I will ask Mr. Wilkinson to go through the three lessons we picked out of that.",
                "I want to go back to Executive colleagues because health inequalities are not just about health. In fact, our research suggests it is only 20% health interventions. It is 40% socioeconomic, 10% environment and the remaining 30% is behaviours such as substance use, smoking and vaping. The tobacco and vapes Bill coming through Westminster will be very helpful on that 30%. I would love to see minimum unit pricing on alcohol but I do not have full Executive support and I need it. I am beginning to think I will not get that this mandate. If we can take a lump out of that 14-year difference, what a difference we are going to make to the lives of those people living in areas of deprivation. To Executive colleagues, when I say it is their responsibility - the Ministers of education, housing and environment - I am not saying I want to use their budgets as well as me taking over 50% of the Executive budget. I am also saying that when it comes to educational underachievement, I know healthier children do better at school so it is my problem. It is not just the Minister of Education's problem. As for our rate of economic inactivity, 27% of people of working age are neither in work nor seeking work. The biggest single reason is ill health, mental and physical. It is not just the economy Minister's problem; it is my problem. These are three of the big sticky issues that have been around since before the 1998 agreement. What a difference it would make if, as an Executive, we collectively decided we would target those three issues and make lives better."

I know there is an intention to increase CAR-T cell therapy capacity in this State. Will the Minister confirm his support for citizens across the island having access to that treatment? Is he engaging with his opposite number here to prepare for that?",

We can all agree that is essential for policy development, strategic planning and workforce planning. I am sure this would be of great benefit to the Minister in his department. I welcome the sentiments in his opening statement about developing that. Will he elaborate on action taken to enable this? In light of his stated intention to introduce legislation on the secondary use of data - that may be the single-clause legislation he referenced earlier - will he provide clarification as to whether this will simplify the existing processes for sharing data on an North-South basis?"

He also outlined that they had a principle that the merging of the services and provision of services in both parts of the island would not denude the service on either side. They were not asset-stripping one side for the benefit of the other. That principle has worked. He said they brought two average services up to a world-leading service on the island. The funding for that has been shared island funding. It struck me in terms of an invest-to-save-type process, there is clear evidence of a particular service that would benefit from the input of funding from both departments. He also made the point there are other areas of health provision which would benefit from the same approach.

We have heard from previous witnesses in the last few weeks that it relies on very motivated individuals and goodwill rather than anything more structured.",

The Minister has shown a real ability to strip out the ideology and just get down to practical co-operation.",

Are the powers we need on the island or are there EU and Westminster dimensions that need to be got through to solve those two pressing issues?"

He will be aware that the British-Irish Parliamentary Association met in Stormont recently. We had a very good discussion on the subject of energy. The challenges facing both jurisdictions in that regard are the same as in health. There is not an unwillingness in either jurisdiction to try to see how we can better co-operate. The Minister referenced the meeting he had with our Minister for Health, Deputy MacNeill, and the next one on 14 January. There is a part that the North-South Ministerial Council plays in this. We had a discussion in mid-November with the All-Island Congenital Heart Disease Network and others. There are blockages that the Minister, Mr. Nesbitt, referenced with GDPR and other issues being faced around data sharing between both jurisdictions. Earlier, he posed a question about where the situation would be and how we would do health services if we were starting out with a blank canvas. What are the top priorities to try to engage an all-island health service? How would that be done?",

Now we have encompass, which gives us the ability to do public health initiatives and to isolate areas and say when we are seeing trends, either geographic or demographic. The data we get in Northern Ireland is good but there will be occasions when the data on an all-island basis is going to be much better. Sometimes, western European data would be good. I want to see information systems talking to one another in a way that allows us to do validated, authentic comparisons.",

Between now and May 2027, people will not see a hell of a lot of difference. My ambition is to set in some infrastructure that compels the next Minister of Health to think they should continue on that journey. The former Secretary of State, Mr. Alan Milburn, was over from London in Belfast a while ago. We were talking about health inequalities and my desire in that regard. He said he really admired me because it was a 50-year project. I needed adult Pampers at that stage because I do not think it is going to take that long, but it is a long-term thing. I am thinking about long-term issues beyond my tenure in this post."

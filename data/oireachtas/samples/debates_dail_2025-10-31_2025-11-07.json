                    "The committee did a very good job. The timeline for pre-legislative scrutiny is set down by the Standing Orders of this House, to the best of my knowledge. The committee kept to those timelines and produced a comprehensive report, and I thank Deputy Ó Laoghaire and all members of the committee for their work on that.",
                    "As the Deputy rightly recalls, the general scheme of the defence (amendment) Bill 2025 was published on 21 May. It consolidates, with amendments, the existing provisions of the Defence Acts 1954 to 2015 concerning the dispatch of members of the Defence Forces for service outside the State. The general scheme also proposes amendments to existing legislation to provide for the suspension of members of the Defence Forces to give effect to recommendations in the 2024 Ward report.",
                    "The pre-legislative scrutiny process of the general scheme was completed, as Deputy Ó Laoghaire rightly says, at the end of July. This process provided the Oireachtas committee with the opportunity to examine the heads of the Bill and to hear from and bring in many relevant stakeholders on the proposed legislation. I am, as I have said, grateful to all members of the committee. There are very good proposals within these recommendations. I say that sincerely. I am working through them with my officials - indeed, I went through quite a number of them this week - as the full Bill is being drafted.",
                    "Under the current proposals in the general scheme to amend the legislation, the requirement for a UN Security Council mandate will be removed. I again underline that the legislation in place allows members of the UN Security Council, by means of a veto or indeed threat of same, to bind this country's hands in its international peacekeeping engagement. Recent vetoes by a UN Security Council member on a proposed resolution for a full and unconditional ceasefire in Gaza last June, as well as the challenges evidenced over the summer with regard to the extension of the UNIFIL mandate to allow peacekeepers to southern Lebanon, are ample evidence of this. With regard to the latter particularly, in the event that the UNIFIL mandate were not extended, Ireland would have been in the position of having to plan to withdraw its Defence Forces personnel from UNIFIL immediately following the expiration of the mandate.",
                    "I believe it is untenable, therefore, for the Government to continue with this policy. I again state my strong belief that such considerations on international peacekeeping engagement should be within Ireland's exclusive sovereign control and that decision-making on this should be purely within the remit of our Government and our Oireachtas, which have been democratically elected by the people of this country.",
                    "I recognise, however, that in removing the UN Security Council mandate requirement there will be a need to strengthen the democratic oversight governing the ongoing deployment of Defence Forces personnel overseas. Therefore, in parallel to removing the UN mandate requirement, text will be included in this Bill which will require that the mandate of future operations be consistent with, and adhere to, the principles of the UN Charter and international law. These principles are being refined to ensure appropriate legal effect as part of the drafting process.",
                    "I am interested in working with the Deputies on this. We will never reach agreement on the broad policy around this - I take that point - but I am determined to bring forward legislation in this area, as is the Government, and we will do that. I am, however, very willing to work with, and in fact very enthusiastic about working with, this House to try to develop an oversight mechanism to provide independent external assurance on adherence to these principles. I do not wish to speak for the committee, but from my rereading of the pre-legislative scrutiny report from the committee this week, I think the committee was teasing its way through that as well. I concede on the floor - not even concede but agree - that there is a need to beef up the legislation on that.",
                    "I intend to bring this Bill to the Government shortly - the Deputies will ask me what \"shortly\" means, which is a fair question; I expect it to be within this year - and for the debate in the Oireachtas to begin thereafter. This will provide - and we should provide - ample time to work through the legislation, and I commit to providing that time from the Government's perspective.",
                    "I want to make it absolutely clear that the Government has no desire to alter our policy of military neutrality. The amendments proposed will do nothing to change Ireland's traditional position of military neutrality, which has always been characterised by Ireland's non-participation in military alliances. Our engagement overseas will continue to be firmly grounded in the principles of the UN Charter and international law and will, of course, require the consent of the democratically elected representatives of the people of Ireland."

In the context of a presidential election and a presidential candidate, or our President, it is not an area in which they have executive power, but the nature of all presidential elections is that there is discussion about Ireland's place in the world, how we see ourselves and how we can best exercise influence internationally. The candidate who, in my view, articulated very clearly a vision for an Ireland that holds its own course and that is neutral, as a clear-eyed assessment of our place in the world and of how best we can use our influence, won a resounding mandate. Most opinion polls indicate very strong support not only for Ireland's policy of military neutrality but also for retaining the triple lock. The Tánaiste has talked a great deal about sovereignty. The greatest test of sovereignty in this jurisdiction is the Irish people. Would the Tánaiste consider putting a significant proposal that has constitutional ramifications to the Irish people?"

The Government will not tell us where it wants to send these troops. I oppose that. I defend our neutrality. I believe the majority of people do. However, I want to focus, at least initially, less on the substance of that but on the democratic question. The Government has refused, despite calls from many in the Opposition, to hold a plebiscite to allow the people to decide, so the closest thing we have to a view of the people is the presidential election. Neutrality was arguably the number one issue in the election, and there was a clear difference between the Government's candidate and the candidate I supported. Both said they supported neutrality, but the difference was that Heather Humphreys said it in the way the Tánaiste says it, which is to empty the word of any meaning. One candidate, Catherine Connolly, defended the triple lock; the other candidate opposed it. The candidate who defended the triple lock got 63% of the vote. That is an expression of people's will. The Government really has no mandate to proceed with this, particularly in the context of the promise to keep the triple lock being crucial in persuading people to change their minds in terms of the second Nice treaty referendum. People have voted for this effectively twice and the Government wants to get rid of it without allowing them a third vote."

                    "No, but I have a mandate to bring forward legislative proposals. I have a mandate to table draft laws, as do the Deputies opposite. I have a mandate to debate and discuss those laws, and my mandate is perfectly valid, as is the mandate of every Member of this House. The Deputies cannot pick and choose which mandates they like. We tend not to talk about the President in this House. I will not do so or talk about the President-elect other than to wish her every health, happiness and success as she prepares to take office. The Deputies should not over-interpret results from any election. Question No. 4 is a fascinating parliamentary question in that Deputy Murphy is deciding to attach motives to the Irish people. We have not seen this since de Valera had to look into his heart to decide where the Irish people stood. Deputy Murphy is deciding what motivated people to go out and vote in the presidential election, a very brave thing to do. I am not sure it tallies with any evidence we have seen from exit polling information that was published by Ireland Thinks. If we want to talk about mandates, one of the figures we should talk about is the fact that 70% of the people of Ireland who had a right to vote either did not vote in the election or chose to spoil their vote. Let us talk about that as well. I would not get carried away in making decisions on the result of a presidential election, which was resoundingly won by President-elect Connolly, and I wish her every success. We are beginning to see that Deputy Murphy will attach to the President-elect every view of every policy he wishes. The President-elect was very clear in the election campaign: I heard her say many times that she would have no role at all in the substance of the legislation. She will have a very clear constitutional role, which she will discharge with distinction, as every President of Ireland ever has done. That is my first point.",
                    "My second is that if we are on the issue of opinion polling - Deputy Ó Laoghaire made the point that the majority of people of Ireland do not favour the change to the triple lock - I do not have the data in front of me but I do remember seeing a poll in The Irish Times that was published only a number of weeks ago that showed opposition to changing the triple lock down and support for changing it up. I think, therefore, that the Irish people are well able to differentiate between military neutrality and amending our laws as to how we dispatch and deploy our troops overseas."

There was the vaguest hint and glance to making such a change in the Fianna Fáil manifesto, but it did not refer to repealing the triple lock. The Tánaiste's party made no such commitment. This is precisely the point. We are not claiming that the presidential election was a referendum on neutrality, pure and simple, but we want a referendum on neutrality. We want a referendum on the triple lock. We want the people to be able to decide. Why is the Tánaiste so scared of allowing the people to have their view and their say on this?",

In fairness to my predecessor, who is now Taoiseach, the process and the policy process of changing the triple lock was advanced in the previous Government. The Deputies will remember the comments of Micheál Martin in the previous Government. When we then went before the people - Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael - we were clearly not indicating that we were going to change that position. We had only articulated it a couple of months earlier. This Government and the previous Government have been quite clear on this. I think a majority of Irish people will come with us in relation to this issue. I think they differentiate between that issue and the question of military neutrality, as they should because I am massively in favour of military neutrality as well. I welcome the recognition from the Opposition today that we are not going to extrapolate every policy issue for the next four years on the basis of an overinterpretation of the results of the presidential election."

                    "The short answer is \"No\". I was enquiring about this recently. I have seen some media speculation in relation to this. I have been honest with the House. A major opportunity and challenge for the Defence Forces is going to be to secure a multi-role vessel programme and the upgrading of that. That is where the focus is and will remain. I am happy to provide that clarity. My priority as Minister for Defence is to ensure the operational capability of the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Service is maintained and developed further in order to enable the Defence Forces to carry out the roles assigned by the Government. The capital funding of €1.7 billion allocated to defence in the latest national development plan up to 2030 represents an increase of €600 million on the previous baseline of €1.1 billion. The revised capital allocations will enable targeted progression on key elements of our commitments to get to level of ambition 2.",
                    "The Commission on the Defence Forces specifically recommended a programme of naval vessel replacement under level of ambition 2 to ensure a balanced fleet of modern ships, including a multi-role vessel, is reached in the next decade. This recommendation has been accepted in principle by the Government. Preliminary work with respect to the consideration of this recommendation with the support of marine advisers is currently under way and nearing conclusion and will inform the next steps in this regard.",
                    "The Naval Service currently has a fleet of eight commissioned vessels. These eight vessels consist of two P50 class large patrol vessels, four P60 class offshore patrol vessels and two P70 inshore patrol vessels. Capital investment in the Naval Service vessel renewal and replacement programme is ongoing. The programme of works for the midlife refit and upgrade of the two P50 class vessels has been completed. Two P70 class inshore patrol vessels purchased from the New Zealand Government were commissioned into State service as LÉ Aoibhinn and LÉ Gobnait in 2024.",
                    "The Deputy will be aware of the challenges faced by the Naval Service in recent years, and to this end I have instructed the Defence Forces to develop a regeneration plan for the Naval Service which I expect to receive in the coming weeks. This will allow for the plotting of a path forward for the future direction of the Naval Service. It is not my intention to advance the procurement of a multi-role combat vessel, but rather to address the recommendation in terms of the multi-role vessel programme."

They are vital for maritime disaster relief, our capacity for peacekeeping and our ability as an island nation with a volunteer Coast Guard to respond to the needs of people in case of emergency. In delicate peacekeeping and humanitarian situations, multi-role vessels are much less likely to be met with resistance than an armed warship and have much more flexibility in the assistance that we can provide. I do not deny that we need serious investment in our Defence Forces, but we need to be clear on what we are trying to achieve because multi-role combat vessels would not deliver our humanitarian and disaster relief aspirations. They would limit us to a much more aggressive role at a huge cost to the Exchequer. We are currently unable to staff the ships that we have. Combat vessels are bigger and more expensive, require more specialised staff and are more expensive to run. I have not heard any discussion on the opportunity cost of going down that path. I am glad to hear that it is not on the agenda. The Tánaiste listed off some technical names of vessels. Will he clarify that none of those are combat vessels?"

It is also what is provided for in the recommendations of the Commission on the Defence Forces. That is the plan. The equipment development plan is a living document. We continue to review it. We continue to update it based on the level of funding available, organisational priorities and timing issues. The Defence Forces are currently re-evaluating all their strategic equipment and infrastructural priorities to align with the revised capital allocation they have received. The Naval Service vessel renewal and replacement programme will be progressed in accordance with this. The Naval Service currently has a fleet of eight vessels. Four of the vessels are regularly deployed on maritime defence and security operations. These four vessels are the three P60 class vessels and the LÉ Aoibhinn, which is a P71. All four vessels conduct patrols on a rotation basis. I will set this out to the Deputy in a note, but the answer to her closing question is \"No, they are not\"."

We need to have a candid conversation about sub-sea infrastructure and the shadow fleet because that is the other context in which this arises. We could have the finest combat vessels available patrolling every inch of Irish waters, but most of the sub-sea infrastructure we are talking about also runs outside of our territorial waters. In those situations, we would be completely unable to do anything to protect those cables, no matter what kind of ships we had. We know this because it has happened on the edges of the waters of NATO member states in the Baltics. While combat vessels may provide an opportunity to virtue signal to other EU countries about our willingness to take part in an arms race, the reality is that our capacity and fleet is best served by equipping them for humanitarian and disaster relief and surveillance. MRVs can monitor cables and foreign vessels and can also save lives on a scale that MRCVs cannot. It is comforting to hear that there are no plans to invest in combat vessels.

This has been prioritised with a target date of 2028 identified in the detailed implementation plan.

We are at a critical stage now in terms of this project and, pending a final decision on the options of delivery, it would be premature for me to make any further comment on likely costs. Training needs will be determined and delivered as part of the delivery of the programme also."

A key focus, and a key early focus of the programme, should be our counter unmanned aerial system capability.

We thank the 362 men and women of Óglaigh na hÉireann for that. I make that point because we get to talk about things in the abstract here.

To support this and the implementation of related measures, the recent budget provided a record allocation of €1.49 billion for the defence sector, an increase of €145 million on 2025. These funds include, among other things, a provision for the recruitment of a net 400 additional Permanent Defence Force members per annum.",

That was the first year for a long time there was a net increase, albeit small, in personnel. I am pleased to say that signs for the year to date give cause for further positivity - I was briefed on this by the Chief of Staff yesterday. Application numbers already exceed the total for last year and discharges are significantly fewer than this time last year. There are many more people applying and fewer people seeking to be discharged.",

That points to the fact that we have found it difficult to retain experienced and well-trained officers who can aid and assist in training young officers in the interests of national security. A key aspect of this is retention. A specialist pay review was recommended by the Commission on the Defence Forces in 2022, which has not been established, to provide an ongoing review of the application of existing specialist pay rates and allowances and to make recommendations where adjustments are required.

Additional staff have been approved to resource cyber command in achieving its initial operational capacity.",

The Defence Forces routinely carry out monitoring and surveillance of Ireland’s exclusive economic zone, EEZ, using our Naval Service assets and Air Corps maritime patrol aircraft. In addition to at-sea monitoring, the naval operations command centre in Haulbowline carries out remote monitoring 24 hours a day, seven days a week. I look forward to visiting it this month to be further briefed and view its work.",

This year, we are seeing the benefits of a number of initiatives I have overseen, such as the patrol duty allowance, with the number of patrol days to date having exceeded the total number of patrol days completed in 2024. We have already seen more ships at sea for more days at sea this year than we did over the whole of last year. The Naval Service continues to maintain a constant presence in the Irish EEZ.",

This will support better monitoring and surveillance of growing threats at sea and will help improve the Defence Forces maritime domain awareness. In other words, we exchange information with other European countries. This will be of significant importance to our maritime security."

That, too, is going to make a big difference in terms of our security because the new sonar capability will now be used on Irish naval vessels to monitor activities in the Irish exclusive economic zone, in particular in the vicinity of our subsea communication cables or our gas pipelines. As I said in response to an earlier question, work is also ongoing on the development of radar capability. I will keep the Deputy up to date."

However, in relation to the benefits of private wires not only will it help the investments the Government will be making but it will allow critical infrastructure, businesses and communities, to generate and use power locally. By creating those semi-independent energy hubs, they can then operate off the grid if our grid is ever physically attacked or there is a cyberattack. By decentralising the supply and removing the single points of failure of our offshore supply, private wires make Ireland's overall energy system more resilient, more secure and far better. It will also help with the housing crisis and it will help with the cost per unit of electricity because we are increasing the supply and reducing the demand. Everyone will benefit from this. I met with the Office of Parliamentary Legal Advisers, OPLA, last week regarding my Bill and I hope to get support from across the House."

The first thing I want to say is that Ireland is never going to recuse itself from conversations around defence and security because conversations around defence and security, as the Deputy rightly knows and advocates for, are not the same as conversations about changing Ireland's military neutrality, which we have no intention of doing. When I sit around tables at Europe, there are a number of other countries - not a majority; far from it - that are also militarily neutral. A country can be militarily neutral and take military and defence seriously. In fact, I would argue that there is a greater obligation on you to take the defence and security of your own country and people seriously when it is not militarily aligned as part of any military organisation or alignment.",

It is a key focus for the work of Government because Ireland will have an opportunity to shape and manage the EU’s agenda for that six-month period. Within the European Union, it is accepted that security and defence is a national competence and that any decisions as regards EU defence arrangements, including any deepening of EU co-operation, does require unanimity. It is within this context that Ireland will balance our policy of military neutrality while holding the Presidency.",
                    "It is the prerogative of member states to make arrangements which serve their own national defence needs, which, in Ireland's case, is our policy of military neutrality, as characterised by our non-membership of military alliances and our non-participation in mutual defence arrangements. Holding the Presidency obviously will not change that policy.",

We are a strong proponent in this country of the important role the EU can play in support of international peace and security.

The latest figures available to me are that personnel in our Naval Service stood at 800 at the end of September, which is up from 719 at the end of last year. I am also pleased to say that at the end of September, we had received 2,357 applications for the Naval Service, which is an increase of more than 400 on what we received in the totality of last year. There is a big body of work to do, which I do not dispute in any way, in terms of our Naval Service. I have instructed the Defence Forces to provide me with a regeneration and growth plan for our Naval Service. It is encouraging to see those numbers in terms of recruitment, retention and applications into the Naval Service this year.",

In the meantime, however, we are continuing to engage with the EU military assistance mission, EUMAM, initiative where we have been providing training to several hundred members of the Ukrainian defence forces."

I intend to work very closely with Ms Kaja Kallas, our EU High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, in trying to bring peace to this horrific conflict. The Deputy is quite right that there is a huge amount of talk and effort put into trying to bring about peace. Unfortunately, that all looks somewhat like folly when we see Putin showing no interest in peace. I believe from a European Union point of view, and this will be Ireland's position, we need to continue to apply economic sanction on Russia to get Putin to change his nexus or his calculus in relation to his illegal aggression. Therefore, it is about continuing to work at a European level to try to maintain that European unity and solidarity in relation to Ukraine. Then, if we get to a point of peace, obviously, Ireland will be wanting to participate in conversations about how we can play a constructive role. However, I think the big challenge, if the war has not ended by then, is going to be to try to bring about peace and be a strong voice in terms of ending the conflict and using the levers at the EU's disposal to maximise that pressure."

Fr. Paul showed huge bravery and courage that night. I recall talking to him in the aftermath of that horrific attack. I was really taken by his absolute Christianity and humanity.

The contributions and sacrifices made by Defence Forces chaplains over the years are widely recognised and appreciated by the Defence Forces, my Department, the Government and the people of this country. Chaplains are not subject to military law, other than when accompanying members of the Defence Forces on active service. Chaplains are responsible for the pastoral care of members of the Defence Forces. Up until now, they have been appointed to a military installation by their bishop or religious superior after consultation with the head chaplain and following approval by the Minister for Defence. With regard to chaplains and their representation, I have asked for proposals to address this urgently. I said this at the RACO conference in Mullingar in recent weeks, where it was one of the issues highlighted. This needs to be resolved. I intend to resolve it once I have received proposals from my officials in the next few weeks. I am happy to engage with the Deputy."

As outlined, the legal advice is that chaplains are not members of the Defence Forces but it is difficult to reconcile that with the reality that they wear the uniform, they are employed overseas and they are remunerated by the Department of Defence, as well as other elements. The objective of RACO is that they would receive the allowances, protections and entitlements afforded to all other members of the Defence Forces such that in practical terms, chaplains would be members of the Defence Forces even if legally that is not the case. There are examples in others sectors. School chaplains are represented by the INTO, so there is a precedent."

At the moment, chaplains are free to join almost any union or representative association of their choice - the Deputy mentioned one example - with the current exception of the military representative associations, RACO and PDFORRA, hence the problem. The law applicable to representative associations is outlined in the Defence (Amendment) Act 1990. Section 1 of the Act defines a member in this context as \"an officer, non-commissioned officer, private or seaman of the Defence Forces\". RACO is limited in law to representing officers of the Permanent Defence Force and chaplains are not classified as officers so they cannot be represented. That is the legal issue and where we have to fix it. I am clear that we need to work together on it.

To this end, my Department published a high-level action plan for the report of the Commission on the Defence Forces. This included recommendations relating to the Defence Forces' cyber defence functions. As a result, the Defence Forces have established a joint cyber defence command. This command will be able to conduct full-spectrum cyberspace operations to robustly defend against cyber threats, support Defence Forces operations at home and overseas and enhance our national cyber defence resilience and contingent capabilities.",

This strategy sets out a comprehensive roadmap to ensure that our Defence Forces achieve operational capability in the new domain. To give effect to this strategy, Defence Forces specialists have been assigned to the operation of this unit. I very recently approved a new Defence Forces officer to that role at the higher rank of brigadier general level. In addition, my Department engaged with the Public Appointments Service to recruit civilian cyber specialists to embed them in the joint cyber defence command. It is intended that such posts will be filled as soon as possible. We are funded to fill them; we are just going through the recruitment process. I am satisfied that from a defence perspective we are now on a positive trajectory to ensure that this new cyber defence command unit is well positioned.",

It recommended that we update and publish the cyber defence strategy in line with best international practice and that we provide for additional specialist personnel at part of a joint cyber defence command managing cyber defence, defence IT services and CIS. All actions have been progressed. We now need to build on that in the time ahead. To ensure the new unit has the appropriate support infrastructure, my Department approved the development of a dedicated IT operations and cybersecurity block in McKee Barracks through the refurbishment of an existing building. McKee was chosen as the location to consolidate a number of current operations and provide the necessary high-end infrastructure requirements to support future operations in the cyber domain. The project is at design stage. The design team was appointed in June. The project will cost around €1.9 million. It is proposed to procure a construction contract by way of a restricted tender competition. This facility will provide for the increasing recruitment needs in terms of space of the joint cyber defence command."

To this end, the Department of housing has completed what it calls the lessons learned process following Storm Éowyn. My colleague, the Minister for housing, Deputy Browne, published the lessons learned report on Storm Éowyn last month.

I will never forget when I was canvassing in Arklow and I went to the house of a young soldier who had come back from Lebanon after six months. I went there out of respect because I was called by community leads, who had a little function for him. He had come back from the Lebanon after six months, as I said, and I think he was in the 124th regiment. I could not get over how young he looked but it was the reaction of his parents to seeing him. We can never underestimate that. As somebody said to me, when somebody joins the forces, their family joins the forces. We can never underestimate what these young men - these young Adams - and women are doing for our country in keeping the peace abroad but also what they mean to their communities. He joined the force because there was a man, Jim Ford, around the corner who was there and he was his idol. It is very important the Tánaiste continue the investment into the Defence Forces and personnel."

I have done many of these but I was very struck by exactly what the Deputy said - the youth. I met a young 19-year-old man who will be the youngest person deployed. I was also struck by the man I met with his ten-month-old baby and his partner. He will be away for that child's first birthday and for Christmas. This is the sacrifice the men and women of Óglaigh na hÉireann pay and their families pay. It is also fascinating when talking to them that so many have a family tradition. I meet the young man or woman and I meet the grandfather as well; it is that level of service. I always make the point of paying tribute to the men and women who serve with such distinction in Lebanon and other parts of the world but also the families who sacrifice a huge amount always but particularly at important moments like Christmas where there is an empty chair at home. That is why it was important that we took the decision to establish a new office of veteran affairs this week because we owe a duty to those who have served with distinction, not just while they are wearing the uniform but in the aftermath of that too."

This is up from 719 personnel at the end of 2024. Let me be honest and say that the establishment strength is 1,094. We are below the establishment strength and we need to get to that number.",

These four vessels consist of three P60 class vessels as well as the LÉ Aoibhinn, with all four vessels conducting patrols on a rotation basis. Any decision to deploy additional vessels on maritime defence and security operations is made by the military authorities.",
                    "Challenges in the recruitment and retention of personnel in the Naval Service are well-documented and a wide range of recruitment and retention initiatives have been introduced to address these. These include: an increase in the maximum recruitment age to 39 for those roles that had a recruitment age below that, and to 50 for direct-entry officer specialists; an increase in the mandatory retirement age to 62; a doubling of the Naval Service patrol duty allowance after ten days; the extension of the Naval Service tax credit for a further five years; the application of the working time directive across the Defence Forces in January of this year, subject to certain exemptions; and the extension of the provision of private secondary healthcare to all members of the Permanent Defence Forces. There has also been significant progress on pay with the most recent increase paid in August of this year.",

Recruitment to date for 2025 has been robust, with 150 inductions to the Naval Service as of 30 September. This is 80 more than the same period last year and 53 more than the total achieved for 2024.",
                    "In addition, significant growth in specialist recruitment has been achieved. Since taking up this role, I have learned very quickly that specialist recruitment for skills needed to get a ship to sea is very often the pinch point. As of 30 September, there have been 16 direct entry inductions into specialist roles in the Naval Service, which is the highest number in five years. Some challenges undoubtedly remain but significant progress is being made on a number of fronts. I thank those behind this work in the Naval Service. It is my intention to visit Haulbowline this month. Perhaps this is something we could arrange for the defence committee to do in the new year as well. It would give members the opportunity to engage directly with the Naval Service at the base in Haulbowline. I have also directed the Defence Forces and the Department of Defence to publish a joint plan on Naval Service regeneration and growth. I expect to also receive that this month. Once I bring that to Government I will be very happy to brief colleagues and engage with them on it."

It is unacceptable that we have had a situation over the past year and a half that ships have been put to sea without a functioning main gun because of inadequate personnel. I raised the issue of artificers earlier, and marine engineering officer teams are operating at roughly half strength. This is resulting in increased workload, added responsibilities and declining morale. This potentially runs the risk of some of those personnel, even adding further to the problem, by departing from the Defence Forces. In some of those critical specialist areas, the numbers remain critically low. This remain the case and has real operational implications and personnel implications. Along with the full radar picture, it is perhaps the most pressing need from a national security point of view to ensure that our naval capacity is brought back to something resembling an acceptable level."

More interventions will be needed to have a step change. That is why I have asked the Chief of Staff to produce a workforce plan by the end of April, which I will then publish and share with Members. This will show how the Defence Forces believe we can get to the figure of LOA 2 by 2028, which is 11,500 people overall, broken down between the Air Corps, the Navy and the Army. It will identify the pinch points. Some might be on our side regarding policy and some may be on their side in terms of training capabilities. We will have this plan by the end of April."

Our neutrality is best served by being able to stand on our own two feet and to engage with our allies on our terms rather than having to rely on the likes of British armed forces or the Royal Air Force in our skies. This is where we need to get to and we can only do that through investment, recruitment and offering a career that is financially rewarding and rewarding on a skills level so that people feel they are part of something bigger, which our Defence Forces actually offer. However, we are still far behind where we need to be. A lot of the improvements will come from actions that have been outlined and more.

In the 63rd naval cadet class, six cadets commenced training but only two were commissioned. The remaining four withdrew before commissioning, citing the extended service commitment associated with naval officer training as the primary reason for their departure. The length of these undertakings needs to be reviewed as well as the terms and conditions. We need a mixture in the Naval Service. We need to ensure there is an adequate number of personnel as a whole. We need to ensure that there are enough cadets, from an officer's point of view. We also need to ensure that the specialist staff are there to ensure that ships going to sea are safe. A ship and the personnel required in it is a machine in several respects and each part is necessary. We do not have enough of hardly any of the parts at this point in time, particularly specialist staff."

We have our ships at sea and our Air Corps. We made a decision, as the Deputies know, to join an information exchange system this year, which is really important for exchanging information with European counterparts on what they might see in their sea heading in our direction and vice versa. We will have a new national maritime security strategy published shortly and over 300 submissions have been made to that.",
                    "Recruitment is very much going the right way. Last year was the first year in quite a number of years we saw any stabilisation or increase in the membership of the Defence Forces. This year we will see a significant improvement on that. What I said to our Chief of Staff yesterday is that in and of itself it is not going to be enough. This is a view he and I share. We are going to have to look at what more can be done. We have established a major training centre that will have huge capacity by 2027, I think, in that it will be able to take in 1,000 recruits a year. We need to ensure all the pinch points are addressed.",
                    "Regarding Deputy Ó Laoghaire's point, the encouraging thing is there is huge interest now in joining the Defence Forces. Whether it is the Air Corps, the Naval Service or the Army, the number of people saying they want to join is going up and we need to make sure we have processes in place to speedily respond to that in a very competitive market for attracting people. I have outlined to the House a number of measures we have taken to try to make such a career more financially attractive. I accept there are issues with cadet pay. I addressed this at the RACO conference and I am committed to my Department engaging with the Department of public expenditure and representative bodies on that matter."

                    "Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta Callaghan as an gceist. SAFE, which stands for Security Action for Europe, is an EU instrument designed to provide member states with up to €150 billion of loans backed by the EU budget to provide financial assistance to member states to support their urgent public investments in defence, increase production capacity, improve the availability of defence products and address capability gaps. Ireland supported the adoption of the SAFE instrument and is availing of possibilities available under the SAFE regulation which will allow our country to realise our ambition more quickly and more efficiently. I am determined to provide for the development of a full spectrum of Defence Forces capabilities that will bring Ireland in line with other similar-sized European countries when it comes to defence and security. The Government continues to invest significantly in defence through our national budget. We saw an increase in capital funding to €1.7 billion. The funding represents an increase of 55% on the figure for the previous five years or €600 million. This increase in funding will be utilised to address long-standing capability gaps, modernise core infrastructure needs and support the delivery of defence responsibilities.",
                    "In the first instance, I have agreed that the Department of Defence should leverage the common procurement opportunities offered under the SAFE regulation as much as possible, so we have decided to opt in to the common procuring under that regulation. By procuring jointly Ireland can achieve lower prices, quite frankly, than we could if we were procuring alone and we will not be competing against other member states for limited resources and we should be able to access additional capabilities more quickly. That is part 1 of the regulation. With part 2, the question is whether we want to draw down loans under the funding mechanism. A decision was taken in conjunction with the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation not to draw down funding via the loan mechanism at this time. However, I have engaged and I expect a second round of calls to be made about that, so we do not rule that out at all. We have prioritised very significantly increasing our capital and current budgets for defence. That is where we are putting our initial resources. We are using the procurement mechanism to jointly procure while keeping the option open to opt in to a loan or funding mechanism at a future date."

We are making good progress and it is really important that this momentum should continue. I mention the second part of the SAFE regulation, which is the loan. One way I would have liked to have seen this momentum continue was through availing of the SAFE loan. It was a loan that was very competitively priced and had a long maturity and for me it is a missed opportunity. I understand fully the logic of not wanting to borrow money when we have a very healthy surplus thanks to the work and commitment of the Ministers, Deputies Donohoe and Chambers, but this loan had other advantages too. It would have really bolstered Ireland's commitment to European solidarity and security, especially in light of the ongoing war in Ukraine and increasing threats to our critical infrastructure, including undersea cables that are vital to Ireland and the EU's digital economy, but also to our democracy."

That said, I certainly do not rule out, and have had conversations about, further SAFE calls from a borrowing point of view that may happen in the future which we may well avail of."

The logic of creating the SAFE regulation was to ensure EU money stayed in the EU to support and encourage European enterprises to be developed with the long-term goal being to strengthen Europe's industrial and technological base. At a recent defence committee meeting, the Department of Defence said that out of the €340 billion spent on defence purchases by European countries, 80% of that went outside the EU. It is to be applauded, therefore, that the EU is working in this way to ensure our industries and economies will benefit from the necessary increase in defence spending across the Union. There is no doubt that in a small nation like ours the opportunities for economies of scale in procurement are greatly increased by us joining other defence forces across the EU for procurement purposes. As the Tánaiste has said, we get better value for the State's money and equipment can be delivered more quickly too.",

I am currently in discussions with the Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Employment on how we look at the mandate of Enterprise Ireland to enable it to assist Irish SMEs that may well be able to do more in this space and wish to do more but perhaps have not been covered by the existing Enterprise Ireland mandate.

We have a conciliation and arbitration subcommittee on the working time directive. This is a matter for formal consultation with the representative bodies. I thank PDFORRA and RACO for their constructive and proactive engagement. My Department and I are absolutely willing to engage with the representative associations on any outstanding matters around implementation through this subcommittee. I highlight that operationalisation is a matter for military management, which I know will take this seriously. I understand that a meeting of the working group subcommittee is due to be held shortly. On foot of the Deputy's question, I will suggest that this be scheduled as quickly as possible and that this subcommittee becomes the forum through which the outstanding matters can be progressed with the representative bodies."

That is an important recruitment tool and it is an even more important retention tool. It is also an important recognition of the important work done by the Defence Forces and the need to protect our Defence Forces personnel. Obviously, there was complexity in introducing the working time directive for our Defence Forces, including the Army. As a result, alternative compensatory measures were put in place. Good faith now needs to be shown by all sides in bringing this to a conclusion as quickly as possible. I will certainly use my own leadership and interest to get us to that point."

It was published in advance of the budget so that we could look at the short-term measures we could take. We acknowledge the increased energy cost pressures on businesses and households and commit to bringing forward measures to contain energy costs and, importantly, to also tackle energy poverty.",

The 9% VAT currently applied to electricity and gas has been extended to 2030, resulting in a saving of approximately €100 per annum for the average household. The fuel allowance has been increased to €38 per week from January 2026. That equates to an increase of more than 15% and will provide an additional €140 to over 460,000 households during the annual fuel allowance season. As the Deputy may know, eligibility for the payment has been expanded to include those in receipt of the working family payment, approximately 50,000 extra households. These are targeted support measures.",

It supports the delivery of our national retrofit programme, which has retrofitted nearly 260,000 homes already. That is a permanent measure. It is an €89 million increase on last year's budget allocation. That means more funding than ever is now available to make homes warmer, healthier, more comfortable and less expensive to heat. These are permanent changes. Analysis carried out by my Department and the SEAI indicates that a household can save between €750 and €1,120 per annum by making changes to their house through the retrofit programme.",

Households pay, on average, €350 per year more for electricity and €150 more for gas. There has been a spate of price hikes across the summer. Will the Government consider reintroducing the supports?"

At a recent meeting of the climate committee, the justification for the price hikes by, for example, Energia came under scrutiny. There are concerns that these are being used as an excuse but we in Sinn Féin introduced legislation to enable the Government to hold energy companies to account and it was rejected by the Government. There is no point in sitting down with energy companies, who not only have to make profit this year, but have to make increased profit next year and the year after that, without proper structures to hold them to account and challenge their narrative that it is all due to the war in Ukraine or to network charges. They should be held to account and have to justify their price increases year on year and month after month."

The Government has delivered just 12% and 3% of those targets. The Government has often said that investment and delivery will rapidly increase year on year, but the budget for 2026 tells a different story. The Minister said it was a record increase but it has the same capital allocation for retrofitting as the Revised Estimate for 2025 so it is actually a decrease on the promised capital investment of €641 million. Are the targets now null and void? Is the Minister going to accept that?"

Social Justice Ireland has said the retrofitting scheme constitutes little more than a wealth transfer. The programme for Government made a number of promises to focus on lower income homes to have retrofits each year from 2026 to 2030 but since then there have been zero changes to how the grant scheme is administered and zero effort to tier the grants so that they can be directed at those who need it most because the upfront cost to a home is an astronomical €60,000 to €70,000 which is unacceptable and unaffordable to most people. Most people on lower incomes, especially those who use solid fuel, often in rural, older homes, are locked out of the scheme. It is a bit like the EV scheme where richer people in Dublin and Cork are availing of it more and not those who need it most."

Only 355 loans have been approved over the last year. If the average loan is about €48,000 that is only €17 million which is far from the game-changing results we were promised.

I stated in response to a previous question that direct measures by way of assistance, particularly to those who need it most, were brought forward in the budget. The energy companies need to play their part too. Arrears levels are too high. I am questioning some of those arrears, particularly on gas.

I would encourage people who feel they are in that space to make sure they are on the vulnerable customer register.

I did discuss those very matters with the four companies in relation to their margins. The IEA report looked at the margin between retail and wholesale. It is not that the retail price is three times higher in Ireland than in other places. It is the margin. There are specific, unique characteristics to Ireland, particularly in relation to us being an island nation, the reliance that we still have on imported fossil, which we need to reduce further, and the fact that our energy retailers hedge and purchase forward. When we see a wholesale price decrease, I can fully understand people asking why the retail price does not come down straight away. The energy companies buy forward and they hedge. They will have purchased energy ten or 12 months ahead in some instances. That is why we do not see that decrease happening as quickly as we would like. I will continue to meet with the energy retailers on a regular basis. I have interrogated their pricing structure and I will be bringing forward further measures in the final energy affordability report, which I will publish in 2026."

There are unique attributes to Ireland. That said, energy costs are too high and we need to bring those prices down permanently. We are affected by geopolitical issues. Ukraine has had an effect, absolutely. Europe has had to pivot away, and rightly so, from dependence on Russian gas and oil. We are still importing a significant amount of our energy from third countries. That is why the expansion of renewables is so critically important, which we are seeing. There was another successful option just a number of weeks ago for onshore and the delivery of additional electricity, our electricity, our energy that is clean and generated here.",

It is important to acknowledge that the largest retailer has not increased its prices. We need to get prices down. We will do that by continuing to diversify our electricity market and electricity generation. That is why grid investment is so critical, including things like the North-South interconnector. If that was built, it would bring down energy prices for every household and every business pretty much straight away. Projects like that need to be delivered."

In particular, my Department has been engaged on advancing guidance on the noise aspect of the draft guidelines to ensure they are robust and fit for purpose, having regard to our target to generate 80% of our electricity from renewable sources, and we need to get there, as well as the need to ensure adequate protection of communities and residential developments in proximity.",

For the month of October, we paid €115 million in curtailment costs and over €300 million in the last three months, taking money from every household to give to people who are profiting from wind energy. This is a business case in terms of what people are doing. They are flooding the market with these now. How many of the wind energy turbines in this country are owned by Ireland?

We see that when we drive through the country. Curtailment costs are an issue and reducing dispatch down is an issue. Why is that? It is because the grid needs upgrading and we need more storage. We have about 1 GW of storage but we need more. Storage is critically important as well in order that we can dispatch energy when we need it. This is an issue, by the way, right across Europe and the developed world. It is not unique to Ireland. However, technologies are improving and we need to expand storage as well in order that we can release that energy, reduce curtailment costs and reduce dispatch down. That is going to happen. That is why PR6, which is the investment plan, will be published before the end of the year by CRU and will detail what investment we need. About €16 billion to €18 billion of investment in our grid between now and 2030-----"

Our climate action plan specifies a target of 5 GW of offshore wind capacity by 2030. That is not going to happen but we need to ensure those projects are in construction and that is down to planning. This target will be met in the early 2030s through a combination of projects from phase 1 and from within the south coast DMAP. The five phase 1 projects with a combined capacity of 3.8 GW are in development off our east coast. Applications for planning consent for all five projects are with An Coimisiún Pleanála and are subject to planning consent. I anticipate that these projects will be in construction by 2030. There were significant further requests from An Coimisiún Pleanála on the five phase 1 projects, mainly related to very significant additional bird surveys. That is the reality, unfortunately, of where we are there but these will be delivered.",
                    "Separately, an offshore wind auction process for 900 MW under the Tonn Nua site off our south coast is under way right now. This site is within the south coast DMAP, which was approved by the Oireachtas and the Tonn Nua project is expected to be operational by 2034.",
                    "My Department is working towards further auctions to achieve our 2030 target. We had a successful RESS 5 onshore auction as well where we secured over 1 GW of onshore renewables. However, offshore is absolutely critical. We need to work these projects through planning and get them out of planning. I have met with the phase 1 developers. I meet them regularly. We saw auctions in Holland recently where there were no bidders at all. Ireland is still seen as a place that is very attractive for offshore wind following on from what the Deputy said. Therefore, there are measures we have put in such as the Maritime Area Planning Act. We need faster consenting through MARA and are working through revised processes in MARA, which are starting to bear fruit. The Planning and Development Act, which the last Oireachtas passed and which the Minister, Deputy Browne, is commencing through the course of this year, will make a big difference as well by setting the statutory timelines. Indeed, the transposition of the RED II and RED III directive, which we are engaged in now will also be critically important."

It is not just in relation to energy. We have been discussing this ad nauseam in terms of different areas of society. Seven phase 1 projects have maritime area consents, as the Minister mentioned, totalling around 4.2 GW, yet none are near construction. The delays in both grid readiness and planning are stalling process. I appreciate the Minister's involvement in trying to get things moving, particularly from a planning perspective and I appreciate how difficult it is. However, EirGrid's offshore grid connection policy is not due until 2026. It will be early next year, so not too far away. Developers still do not have clarity on connection costs or timelines. The maritime area planning regime, while welcome, has no statutory decision timelines. Anything around here needs timelines. An Coimisiún Pleanála lacks the resources and the expertise to process these applications quickly."

We respect the right of third parties. However, we have done things well too. If you look at onshore, which I have mentioned previously, we are a European leader in the integration of renewables into our grid. We are a European leader - and one of the world leaders; number two in the world - in relation to onshore winds. We have gone from about 7% of electricity generation through renewables just 20 years ago to about 41% or 42% last year. This shows what is possible. To be fair, the granting of onshore applications by An Coimisiún Pleanála in quarter 1 and quarter 2 of this year reached record levels. That is why we have had a very successful RESS 5 auction. However, offshore is really where we are going to see that absolute pivot. If we look at just those five projects, there is nearly 4GW. We have between 6 GW and 7 GW of onshore renewables. We will see in these projects alone what that will deliver. I will come back in on supplementary regarding MARA."

It is not just about missing or meeting our climate targets. Offshore wind is Ireland's single biggest opportunity to secure our own clean energy, cut bills for families, as the Minister mentioned earlier, and build a new industry with long-term jobs along our coast. We have seen the success of onshore and of solar throughout the country and the expertise we have garnered in those two key areas. However, to realise the ambition, we need urgency and we need accountability from the various bodies in how projects can move from plans into generating power."

I attend the offshore wind energy task force and, for the first time, I brought this sector into the room. Therefore, it is not just Government agencies. We have brought in the development sector and it is at all of the meetings. Instead of people writing back and forth to each other, or attending separate meetings, everything is dealt with in the room. That urgency is there.

Therefore, all the extra energy we are creating in renewables is being gobbled up by the data centres. The Government's own officials last November, in a memo issued by the Department of public expenditure, pointed out that the upward pressure on energy bills is due mainly to data centre expansion. That followed a warning from the Secretary General of the Minister's own Department in May that data centre growth could threaten our ability to solve the housing crisis. We have repeatedly highlighted the unfairness in the funding model for our grid, but the draft or interim decision for PR6 in July seems to ingrain this. Under the CRU's draft decision, households and SMEs will see their electricity network charges increase but the data centre users will see reductions of up to 18%."

They are not correct. Government policy is clear on this. We have a growing population and growing housing stock, thankfully. Price review 6, when published before the end of this year, will show how we will meet that future energy demand. We need to invest in our grid, and there will be a cost associated with that. I mentioned what we were doing last night in relation to providing the equity investment for ESB and a further equity investment for EirGrid. That reduces the requirement for borrowing somewhat and allows them to leverage off that equity to borrow. Into the future, I will look at maybe longer term borrowing and repayment to reduce the burden on the regulatory framework. That is something we have to balance, but we do need this grid investment. I put it to the Deputy again that projects like the North-South interconnector are absolutely required. This is consented to both sides of the Border and it is not developed. It needs to happen. The connector is one project that will bring down energy bills for businesses and households straight away."

Unfortunately, however, there does not seem to be anything there to safeguard against repeating past mistakes to ensure that the investment is directed towards the social good and to prioritising energy affordability. One company, Energia, justified its recent price hikes based on the network charge increases. On its website it says that it has worked to minimise the impact on customers but that the price changes are unavoidable. At a recent appearance before the committee, however, concerns were raised that network charge increases could not be used to explain its recent price hikes because the network charges increased by €29 but its charges increased by €200. This suggests that the energy suppliers may be using network costs to facilitate extra profit, which is not surprising. To date, the committee has received no update from the regulator about its justification. At a minimum, we need transparency as to how the costs are translated into bills and mechanisms to safeguard against profiteering."

I have met the four largest energy providers and have interrogated them on this very matter. We have to watch this very closely. Energy bills are too high in Ireland. They are too high right across Europe. In Cyprus, net energy costs are about 20% of average net pay, so we are not on our own on this. We are about the eighth most expensive in Europe. As I mentioned to Deputy Whitmore earlier, there are unique reasons for that because of our being an island nation, but we need to take measures that will drive down costs permanently. We will always be at risk of geopolitical issues too, though. That is why we need to continue and accelerate the delivery of clean energy and renewables - energy that we ourselves own and can generate to decarbonise our society, to reduce energy bills and to secure energy for the future of this country. That is what drives me. Affordability is key and central to that. Every discussion I have at the European Council and with energy providers is about affordability. We have to work hard on that to drive down costs and provide affordability but also support those who need it most. That is why the measures in the budget were so critical."

This puts a far greater cost burden on the owner. I am led to believe there is a significant shortage in such professionals, both technical and practical. This makes for huge delay in delivering the energy upgrades and therefore they are far less attractive. For example, the cost of conservation technical expertise to ensure the internal and external walls of these properties are treated properly could erode a grant available of up to 60%. Does the Minister of State have a breakdown of the number of traditional properties that have taken on these energy upgrades? Will the Minister of State consider putting some extra funding in place for people who own these properties to engage conservation professionals?"

One part of that was a new pilot to support the retrofitting of traditional built homes. I will work with the Deputy on the specific instance he has raised. We have also introduced two pilots aimed at informing approaches to increase the number of heat pumps installed. We know as demand increases a lot of the traditional built homes that may have conservation challenges will become a lot more expensive to retrofit. We are working at streamlining the processes. If there are examples that the Deputy wants to share with us, we certainly will work with SEAI and try to build them into a broader programme that meets the needs of everyone throughout the country."

As I said earlier, we need more skills and contractors and better supply chain resilience. That is why we are very much focused on more SEAI staff for the warmer homes scheme, and indeed, more one-stop shop operators. It is at 26 already. To the Deputy's point, it needs to be ensured that all homes are included. To get that specific skill set and expertise is something we can go to back to SEAI on and revert to the Deputy on. We will get the figures to the Deputy around warmer home retrofits for traditional homes."

The Government, my Department and the Minister of State, Deputy Dooley, are fully committed to protecting our rivers, safeguarding our fish stocks and supporting local communities and anglers. I fully recognise and acknowledge the seriousness of the fish kill on the River Blackwater near Mallow. This event has had a major impact on local community anglers and the wider catchment. From the outset, the Minister of State, Deputy Dooley, was in regular contact with Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, Cork County Council, local councillors and Oireachtas Members in the area. He has visited this site twice and established an interagency group to co-ordinate, investigate and respond. The investigation concluded in September by IFI on behalf of the interagency group set up to co-ordinate the investigation. The report is published on the IFI's website. The report provides a clear account of the State's response to and the investigation into the incident. The incident conclusively rules out systemic disease, water quality issues and licensed discharge. Evidence pointed to a short-lived waterborne irritant that dissipated before it could be traced as a source.",
                    "While it is regrettable that no specific cause was found, I assure the House that this was not due to a lack of effort or action but because the event was transient. The Minister of State and the Department are satisfied that every avenue was investigated with over 40 site inspections, 900 chemical screens, pathology tests and extensive monitoring, sampling and surveys were carried out by the interagency group. The priority is now to apply lessons learned from this event, strengthen enforcement and build resilience to ensure that we are better prepared to prevent and respond to any such further incidents. On that note, IFI has commenced the process of formalising a joint protocol with other relevant State agencies to address significant future pollutant events that result in fish kill. This will ensure that a combined emergency response will be deployed as quickly as possible to mitigate the effects of significant pollution discharge that impacts fish and their habitats."

It was probably way more than 40,000 fish, such as trout, that were killed. The problem is that once those fish are gone, they are gone. Their reproduction capacity is gone. It will take more than ten years to get the river back to a standard and that will not naturally happen either. There has to be serious management and monitoring of the river because there are invasive species in it and they may now become the dominant species there. It is important issue that needs to be taken care. I welcome the interagency group. It is important that protocol is put in place immediately or as soon as possible. What was clear from investigating this was that all the different agencies were working in their own silos. There was little overlap between them. Unfortunately, the delays that happened allowed for that contaminant to wash through the system before any investigations could happen."

We go back to the Energy Security in Ireland to 2030 report that we published, and we published the Cambridge Economic Policy Associates report as well. We offered briefings on that too. A very clear risk was identified in that we have no gas reserve in this country. That is why we are proceeding with the floating storage and regasification unit, FSRU, which will be State-owned, State-led and State-operated. I expect we will receive a decision shortly from Gas Networks Ireland, GNI, on preferred locations. State-owned and State-led is absolutely needed and required. My focus is on expanding renewables, reducing our dependency on fossil fuels and moving away from them. We operate an open and transparent legal regulatory and planning consenting framework. Any application for fossil fuel infrastructure in Ireland will be subject to appropriate approvals by the relevant bodies. They also have to have regard to the provisions of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021. Government policy on reducing fossil fuel use is set out in our programme for Government. We are absolutely committed to it. We remain of the view that long-term energy security is best achieved through substantial growth in indigenous clean, renewable energy; improvements in energy efficiency, which we have discussed; electrification of heat and transport; and increased electrical interconnection with our neighbours. The Celtic interconnector is under construction. We will have the MaresConnect interconnector, and we are engaging with European partners on another interconnector to continental Europe. Any application made for any fossil fuel generation is a matter for the planning authority, but it must have regard to our climate Act and our programme for Government."

He did not actually provide a clear answer to the board, and he essentially gave the same response as he has just given to me, but that is not the same as giving a clear policy direction. The previous Government gave a clear policy direction on fracked gas. That is no longer in place. What I am looking for, and I hope the Government will do in recognition of the fact that it wants us to move away from fossil fuels, is a clear policy direction from the Minister to say that private commercial LNG facilities is not a policy the Government wants implemented in Ireland. That was the kind of direction An Coimisiún Pleanála was looking for. It will be making its decision on this in early 2026. Will the Minister please provide that guidance?"

The reality is, if a privately owned LNG facility is established, there is no way that any Government could justify spending nearly €1 billion on a publicly owned one. My fear is that if the privately owned facility gets the go ahead, the Government will quietly kick to touch the publicly owned one and instead rely on that privately owned one.

                    "I thank the Deputy for his question. Our Department is very committed to helping households cut energy, reduce emissions and generate their own clean power. Grants of up to €1,800 are available through the SEAI for solar photovoltaic, PV, installations in homes built and occupied before 2021. Since 2022, over 90,000 homes have received grants totalling over €196.7 million, delivering 450 MW of installed capacity and saving over 93 kt of CO2.",
                    "This high demand shows the scheme is working and the solar industry has scaled up to meet market needs. Homes built since 2021 must comply with Part 11 of the building regulations which set high energy performance standards. Builders can meet these requirements by installing heat pumps and-or solar PV during construction, which is typically cheaper than retrofitting. New builds, therefore, already enjoy significantly higher energy efficiency compared to older homes.",
                    "In addition, since May 2023 the VAT rate for solar PV installation in private dwellings was reduced to zero. This applies to new builds as well as existing homes. There are no plans to change the eligibility criteria at this stage but the scheme will be kept under review. Meanwhile, households can benefit from the clean export guarantee which pays for the excess electricity exported to the grid. The rate is currently between 15 cent and 25 cent per kilowatt, depending on suppliers. The Government is also investing record funding of over €550 million in budget 2026 to support energy upgrades, including solar PV and the national retrofit plan. As we are making it easier and cheaper for households to install solar PV through grants, zero VAT and export payments, we will also ensure newer buildings meet high energy standards from day one."

Indeed, it reduces the overall installation cost because if it is not included in a new build, the costs will be greater compared to retrofitting.

These figures cover all plastics, including PET. As EU exporting reporting does not isolate individual polymers, currently most PET collected is recycled abroad due to economic viability, but measures are underway to change that.",

Under the single use plastic directive, PET plastic beverage bottles must include 25% recycled content from 2025, rising to 30% by 2030. This creates strong market demand for recycled PET and makes investment in Ireland's recycling infrastructure more attractive. Schemes like the deposit return scheme and Repak play a key role in meeting targets and supporting investment. Repak currently provides €100 per 10 tonnes of plastics recycled in Ireland and is working with industry to expand capacity. The forthcoming whole-of-government circular economy strategy will set ambitious targets to reduce resource use, increase reuse and drive innovation. My Department is working closely to create conditions for higher PET recycling rates through regulation, market incentives and investment in domestic capacity."

We are exploring avenues in regard to how we make use of the unredeemed deposits. The establishment of a recycling bottle-to-bottle plant will be an important part of how we deal with the additional consistent supply of high-quality PET, and it makes the investment viable. No decision has been made in that regard yet. We are working through that with Re-Turn, and we will make that decision known in due course."

We have massive opportunities there. We have not done well in Ireland. We have one district heating scheme in place in Tallaght, but we have a number of others that we can deliver in the near term. To this end, the district heating steering group report was approved by the Government the year before last. The report contains a suite of recommendations, but we really need to move on this.",

I met with officials from the EIB, and we signed an agreement the week before last. My Department is now engaged, through the SEAI, in undertaking a comprehensive advisory project, which will draw on best practice across Europe to help to inform the long-term strategy for developing district heating systems in Ireland. I am speaking at the district heating Ireland conference next week, and I expect to have expressions of interest in other schemes on that.",

The general scheme of the Bill has been approved by the Government. It has been drafted with the intention of appointing the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities, CRU, as the regulator for all heat networks, including district and communal heating, which Carlinn Hall falls under. The general scheme sets out proposed functions for the regulator, so there is work ongoing.",
                    "The Deputy has raised Carlinn Hall on a number of occasions in this Chamber. It is a private scheme. It is not a district heating scheme. The SEAI has provided - I have asked them to provide - advisory assistance to residents. I believe that is under way. There are some solutions there. We are a long way from the EIB being able to assist Carlinn Hall residents, but if we can continue to provide advisory support to residents, I will continue to ensure that happens. Some bespoke solutions have been put forward to residents in that development and it is something they will need to advance, but if we can provide support in an advisory way, we will."

We are talking about another 50,000 households in that space. I met with the four main energy companies directly. At my request, they have established hardship funds across those providers for the winter months and I am grateful that they have.

We are doing a specific piece of work on noise. That is in my Department. We work with the lead Department in relation to the publication of the draft guidelines. This is not passing the buck; it is just a fact that the lead Department is the Department of housing and local government. We are working in conjunction with it. Once the draft guidelines are published, they will be published for public consultation. I want to see an expansion of renewables, which we are seeing, and expansion of wind energy, solar, utilising biomethane and AD and other forms of renewable energy. For clarity's sake and for communities, the guidelines are being updated, need to be updated and will be published in draft form. I cannot give an exact timeframe but work is advanced and nearing completion in that regard. I will respond to the Deputy directly after I consult the Minister, Deputy Browne."

                "The cost-of-living crisis is completely out of control. It is getting worse by the day. It is putting people under massive pressure. We have constant price hikes and ever-increasing bills. It means working households, even those with two incomes, are really struggling to keep up now. They are squeezed from all angles. It is price hike after price hike, bill after bill and people cannot catch their breath. They are living in stress at thought of the car or the washing machine breaking down - that wee one unforeseen expense tipping them over the edge - and you sit there and you do nothing. Last month, you delivered a budget of €9.4 billion that left people worse off. It was a budget with no cost-of-living package, where you broke your promise of tax breaks for workers. It was littered with cushy tax breaks for top-brass executives, developers and landlords. You left working people behind and you chose to look after those at the top at the expense of everyone else. Your priorities are right here to be seen in your finance Bill. While you could not find the money for cost-of-living supports, here is what you did find the money for - a tax cut of €105,000 for the highest-earning executives, 99 of whom already earn over €1 million, and 19 of whom earn over €3 million; a tax reduction of €320,000 but you only get that if your pension pot is already €2 million and more; and measures that allow developers to make millions of euro of profits building apartments and not having to pay a penny in tax on those profits. You are pouring money into the pockets of those who are already flush while ordinary workers have to watch every euro as they are hit by massive electricity bills, sky-high food prices, rip-off insurance costs and out-of-control rents. There is no end in sight for families out there.",
                "You guys talk about a magic money tree when dismissing the calls to help households. Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have a big fat magic money tree and its leaves are evergreen when it comes to looking after the big boys. You have no problem there and ordinary people see it. You took away their energy credits; you took away the double child benefit payment; you hiked up student fees despite the fact that you promised you would reduce them; you increased the cost of petrol, diesel and toll roads; you jacked up the local property tax; and you provided no extra help for renters but a nice increase for landlords. That is where your priorities lie. None of this is fair. It is not right and you need to change course. Targeted measures are needed, of course, but this cost-of-living crisis has got so out of control that measures that are targeted are no longer enough. We need far more than that. The truth is households which would have been fine just a couple of years ago and would have been getting by all right are now in desperate situations. They are drowning in bills and your Government simply does not acknowledge that. I ask you this: has the penny dropped? Did you hear from people when you were knocking on the doors during the presidential campaign - although we heard you did not do much of that - that they are really struggling, very frustrated and annoyed you have chosen to make them worse off in this budget while you protect the incomes of people at the very top who are already flush?"

Week in week out, he comes in here and says that €9.4 billion more is being spent etc. and then he tries to pivot to suggest it is all being spent in a certain direction. He ignores the fact and does not tell people at home that the bulk of that money went to increasing public services. I presume he agrees with the very significant increase - hundreds of millions of euro extra - in funding for disability services that came out of that pot to which he referred. I presume he agrees with the very significant increase in the education budget, including for capitation fees and special education, all the extra funding to our health service and the largest ever social protection budget, including measures for carers and a major expansion in fuel allowance increases for pensioners. To be honest, I am not sure any more whether he agrees with measures we took to try to help the hospitality sectors in towns and villages in Donegal and across this country. They said to us that their cost base was too high and that was having a real impact on them in keeping the doors open, in servicing the tourism sector, which is such an important part of our economy, and in keeping people in employment. That is a whistle-stop tour of where a lot of the money went in this budget.",

We took a decision to reduce the cost of building an apartment to help to make sure more apartments are built. This week, there was an Oireachtas housing committee meeting. I am not sure if the Deputy has seen it. If he has not, I am sure Deputy Ó Broin will fill him in. Person after person who has responsibility for building apartments came in and said this will make a real difference and will mean we can build more homes for young people to buy and rent."

I do not think when you meet them you describe them in the way you do in this House. You have also come in today, and you tried this at the finance committee yesterday, to try to suggest the measures we have taken to assist small landlords are somehow disproportionate to the measures we have taken for renters. Lest there be any doubt, the budget package we have in place to help renters, the renters' tax credit, is three times the cost to the Exchequer as the tax credit for landlords to try to keep people in the rental market.",

                "It is vitally important that all of us show leadership. Words matter. The Tánaiste's words matter. Where misinformation is spread, we must challenge it. Where there are attempts to sow hate and division, we must build cohesion. Leadership means bringing calm to a debate, not inflaming it. The Tánaiste has said that migration, outside of the number of international protection applicants, is too high. What sectors will he be targeting to reduce the number of migrant workers? Will he be targeting multinationals, pharmaceutical and tech companies? The Tánaiste knows well that these sectors provide a huge amount of employment and taxation which funds our public services. Will the Tánaiste be targeting the health and care sectors? If it was not for migrants working as doctors, nurses and carers, these services would crumble.",
                "Will the Tánaiste be targeting the large number of migrant workers that our food processing sector relies on? How would a shortage of workers in this sector impact on grocery prices? I doubt somehow that the Tánaiste will target the hospitality and tourism sectors. Which cafés, pubs, restaurants or hotels would the Government close? Is the Government thinking of reducing the supply of construction workers? This would have a detrimental effect on our ability to build the homes that are needed, the schools and hospitals. Which major infrastructure projects would the Tánaiste shelve? It is migrants who do essential work as security guards, cleaners and shop workers. Does Government think we can somehow do without these essential workers?",
                "Migrants play a critical role in our economy and our society. It is not just as doctors, nurses or carers - they bring skills and expertise to a wide range of sectors and contribute significant levels of taxation that fund our public services. Migrants are not just critical to our economy; they contribute to communities, culture and sport. They are our friends, our family members and our neighbours. I welcome the news that Zohran Mamdani has been elected mayor of New York. In his victory speech on Tuesday night he said, \"New York will remain a city of immigrants: a city built by immigrants, powered by immigrants and, as of tonight, led by an immigrant.\" It is a powerful reminder that immigration is not a threat; it is a source of strength. As the Tánaiste will know, many of the immigrants who built New York came from Ireland. We should show the same pride in the people helping to build and power our country now.",
                "We have an ageing population, which means that our reliance on migrant workers will only increase in years to come."

                "First, I join the Deputy in agreeing that what we saw happen in Drogheda at the IPAS centre is the most despicable crime. It is attempted murder. It has nothing to do with a migration debate in this country - absolutely nothing. It is a horrific, almost unspeakable act where babies and young children were sleeping upstairs. Everybody in this country, regardless of their political perspective, is utterly horrified. We are all united on that.",
                "I also join the Deputy in reiterating what I already said and what I say every time I speak about migration: migration is a good thing and migrants make a positive contribution to this country. I do not in any way doubt that. I often say that our health service would fall over if it was not for people coming in. I take the Deputy's point that they are in many other parts of our economy and our society. When you go into our schools and see the diversity, that is a good thing. I do not have any disagreement with the Deputy or anybody else on that.",
                "I also know this: we have to have a clear migration policy. It is a statement of fact that our population has grown at a very fast rate. It is a statement of fact that for every 10,000 people who come into our country, roughly 3,000 more homes are needed. I believe it is a statement of fact that we need to look at migration in the round, we need to plan for it and we need to have a mature discussion about what is an appropriate level of migration. We need to do exactly what the Deputy has suggested, which is to go through our economy sector by sector and identify the work needs there. The Future Forty document that has been published this week by my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, is very useful in terms of analysing around 2,000 potential different scenarios regarding how our country might develop and grow in our demographics.",
                "We need to have an evidence-based debate. The Deputy has not said it but some of the comments from his party this week were disappointing. Accusing someone of dog whistling and at the same time calling them Nigel Farage, which I think is a dog whistle, is not a mature debate.",
                "People from other political parties immediately just call me names for stating the fact that, in my view, migration has risen at too high a rate, but it actually is not just my view. I have here a graph that uses Eurostat data. The green line shows Ireland's net migration and the blue line is the equivalent Europe and the grey line is the equivalent for the eurozone. It can be seen objectively that over the last several years our population, in terms of net migration, has risen way faster than the European average and way faster than the eurozone average, and that is a challenge. The extremes in politics, which neither the Deputy nor I is a part of, on the far left and the far right are the ones that fester when politicians of whatever stripe in the centre do not stand up and show willingness to engage, discuss and debate.",
                "The Government intends to do two things. It intends to bring forward new legislation for international protection and there are legitimate issues that need to be addressed, including the fact that the majority of applications are refused. The Government also intends to produce a national migration strategy in 2026 to have an evidence-based, data-driven, informed discussion. I would invite people across the House to engage with that in a calm and responsible manner."

The Government published a report this week saying that to meet housing demand alone, we need at least 50,000 additional construction workers. The Tánaiste also knows the facts about our ageing population. Again, the report pointed to the situation that we will soon have a reduction in the numbers in our workforce who will be able to support people who are retired, to pay for pensions and to care for our elderly. The Tánaiste knows these facts. Unless there is a miraculous baby boom, we are going to need more and more migrant workers to help support our public services and our economy, to care for our elderly and to contribute to society, and that is a good thing. Migrant workers have played a very positive role in Ireland and we are going to continue to need that. We are talking about cutting off some of the supply of workers that we need in different parts of our economy. I have listed off a range of areas where migrants are essential. I challenge the Tánaiste to say where he will reduce the supply of migrant workers. Is it in housing, health, pharma or tech? What area of the economy does the Tánaiste think can do with fewer migrant workers? Let us stick to the facts. Where does the Tánaiste think there is an oversupply in the workforce at the moment?"

I met with Damien Owens, the director general of Engineers Ireland. and spoke to engineers who did not even know the standard was being reviewed. They are being trained to use documents that Government-commissioned research from Geological Survey Ireland has proven to be scientifically wrong. The damage in these homes is caused by internal sulphate attack, not mica, yet engineers are being instructed otherwise. This is not a neutral educational decision. The Housing Agency employs these chartered engineers. They must complete this training to work on the defective concrete scheme. They are being instructed to apply for this discredited standard and are paying for the privilege. Damien Owens has told the Oireachtas joint committee that IS 465 is not fit for purpose, yet Engineers Ireland is proceeding anyway, while Government agencies employ and rely upon these same engineers. The State cannot pretend to detach from this by funding the research that disproves the standard and at the same time allow its own agencies and engineers to operate and to be trained. The research does exist and was paid for by the Government. The Government is complicit in misleading homeowners and committing an injustice.

Will he confirm that the Government accepts full responsibility for the oversight of such training and the competence of the engineers whose assessment determines homeowners' eligibility for redress? Will he acknowledge it is entirely unacceptable that the Government commissioned and paid for research that disproves IS 465, yet allows its own scheme to continue training and deploying engineers and to act as if the research does not exist? Will he finally accept that every decision taken under this flawed framework deepens the State's exposure to legal challenges and potential judicial reviews?

From 6 November, all homeowners who have been given an non-demolition option will be offered a choice of continuing with the work on their dwelling under the option determined or the option of a full technical review of their application by the Housing Agency. This review will be informed by the current research, once the full review of IS 465 is complete. If homeowners choose to continue with the works, they will continue to avail of the 40-year Government guarantee. Homeowners who receive an option 1 demolition are unaffected by the changes.",
                "This is complex. It is an important matter and it potentially has serious implications for homeowners and also for the Exchequer. I need to be truthful about that. The Department will review the contents over the consultation period and consider the advice received from the expert group. I do not want to make any inappropriate or pre-emptive comments on the draft standard or the potential changes that it might bring to the grant scheme, but the point about additional training is well made. Yes, training will have to be provided should there be changes, and it will have to be certified or overseen by Government. I will ask the Minister, Deptuy Browne, to continue to engage with the Deputy and other Oireachtas Members in affected counties on this quite technical but very practical measure for homeowners."

I have heard on my recent visits to Donegal that there are also a number of tweaks, though that is completely the wrong word, on how the scheme is being applied and homeowners have made some sensible suggestions to me. A group of homeowners feel they are falling between stools in terms of being able to access and draw down a scheme that has quite a large quantum of money.

It states exactly what I and others have been saying here for years about UHL. It came out with an A, B and C plan. My view is we need A, B and to work for C. Option A would involve expanding the capacity at UHL. Option B envisages the ED staying on the existing site, along with the infrastructure for critical and complex surgical procedures. Option C is a new hospital for the future. Again on a positive note, a meeting was held here yesterday, convened by Deputy Cooney. It was well-attended by all parties and none. For the first time I was at a meeting where everyone in the room was on the same wavelength. It was 100%. All parties were there. They said A and B plus C.",

Let us compare one to the other. That private hospital contractor made profit on that building, so why can we not build our hospitals more cheaply, and we take the profit margin out? Why do we not go to the private sector to deliver it? I want A, B and C. I am going to work with everyone who was in the room. There were other people who could not attend who are also in favour of this. The Minister, Deputy O'Donovan, is here. I hope he backs this as well. We want a new hospital for the mid-west region. The lives of people in Limerick, Tipperary and Clare are at risk unless we deliver this. I have been critical of UHL since the start. I am delighted the previous management are gone. I am delighted with the management there at the moment because they are working with everyone who was at the meeting yesterday. People could not speak highly enough of the management in situ. Bernard Gloster is retiring. He is a massive loss, but replacing him is in the Government's hands and whoever takes his place better be as good as he is because otherwise we are going down the same rabbit hole again."

There are some things that are just more important that party politics and shouting and roaring at each other in here. Healthcare and making sure the people of the mid-west have a proper, fit for purpose health service is our priority, the priority of the Minister for Health and the priority of everybody I know across this House. Let us proceed on that basis. Deputy O'Donoghue and other mid-west TDs have been very vocal advocates for the improvement of services at UHL for a sustained period and there is a need for a comprehensive approach to the provision of services in the short and long term, because people cannot wait forever and a day. They need stuff now and then they need to know where this is going in the time ahead. We are fully committed to improving services in the mid-west region.",

The Deputy was at the opening and I want to acknowledge that. I am glad to say that while nobody wants to see anybody on a trolley, we are beginning to see the benefit of that extra capacity. I too know the new management team the Deputy mentioned to be good people, based on my past postings. I am glad to report the average number of people waiting on trolleys at UHL has halved in the three weeks since the new 96-bed block opened compared with the three weeks prior to that. It is still too high, but it shows the benefit. If you put in extra beds and put in the right management you can begin to see improvements. Importantly, there are now enabling works under way for a second 96-bed block. A further 84 inpatient beds are planned at UHL through the acute hospital inpatient bed capacity expansion plan. These projects include 32 rapid build beds. With the first 96-bed block, when you add that up we will increase bed capacity through this variety of initiatives by 308 beds by 2028, with 572 new beds across the region by 2031.",
                "Let us get back to the HIQA review. We have a roadmap. The HIQA review gave us three options, but the Deputy is kind of right; it did not necessarily gave us three options. Did it give us a menu to work through? The Minister briefed the Government on 30 September. Option A of the review was \"Expand Capacity at UHL on the Dooradoyle site\". Let us all agree we have started that, we need to do more of that and the quicker the better. On the point about infrastructure delivery and cutting through red tape, we are going to have proposals from the Minister, Deputy Chambers, and his Department very shortly, probably this month, on how we speed up infrastructure delivery. The second option was to \"Extend the UHL hospital campus to comprise the existing Dooradoyle site and another site...\". The third option talked about the potential to develop a model 3 hospital in the HSE mid-west. Alongside these options, HIQA has also presented an extensive number of additional considerations, including system-wide work - reforms, I suppose - that need to be progressed in parallel. I am clear that all options remain on the table. The Government has not ruled out doing any or all of these. That has not happened. The extensive findings and considerations presented by HIQA are being considered fully by the Minister and her officials and in terms of this not dragging on, the Minister has committed to reporting back to Government on next steps by Christmas."

My office and I have been in contact with many of those directly affected since the closure and what we have heard is deeply troubling. Over the past two years, conditions within the company have clearly deteriorated and many people now question whether the takeover of Fastway in 2022 was a case of vulture capitalism and whether fraud or serious mismanagement was involved. Franchise owners and employees have described a situation that became more chaotic and unfair as time went on, with invoices going missing, payments being delayed or held back and commissions not being paid at all. Many were struggling just to keep their businesses afloat while waiting on money that never came. I have also been told of polygraph machines, that is, lie detector machines, being used in franchise interviews and of large cash payments being requested as part of the purchase process, raising serious questions about transparency, legality and oversight.",

They are now left with huge losses and no way to recover the money. One franchise owner I spoke to is now facing personal insolvency. He is owed around €50,000 by the company and owes roughly the same amount to Revenue. He had been in the process of selling his franchise earlier this year, hoping that a busy Christmas and new year period would allow him to clear his debts and move on. Instead, with the closure, he is left with nothing but debts. This is increasing stress and his livelihood is gone.",

Will the Tánaiste tell us whether there is currently any investigation under way into the management, ownership and conduct of Fastway since its takeover in 2022? If there is not, will he push for one to be launched to establish the facts, to hold those responsible to account and to ensure justice?"

My thoughts, along with those of the Deputy and everybody in this House, are with all of those affected by the receivership. This news is extremely concerning. The Deputy has given us tangible examples of the human impact of this issue. It is hugely concerning for all involved. While there is never a good time for something like this to happen, it comes at a particularly difficult time of the year. The Deputy has made a number of very important points on behalf of his constituents. I very much respect that. I will not comment too much for fear of affecting processes that are in place or that could be put in place in due course. I would not want to cut across the independence of such processes. However, I will make sure that the Deputy's comments are brought directly to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Burke, and the Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Dillon, who is here with me today. I will make sure that all of those matters are considered in an appropriate manner.",
                "Receivership is a long-standing legal mechanism for the enforcement of a security. It is important to note that receivers are independent in the execution of their roles and neither the Government nor a Minister can intervene in such matters. The Department of Social Protection is now engaging directly with the receivers and the affected employees to provide them with necessary information and support at this time. There are robust protections in place for employees of an insolvent employer and it is important that these are made clear to everybody involved. The receivers submitted a collective redundancy notification to the Department of Enterprise, Tourism and Employment on 31 October. I understand the receivers are currently undertaking the 30-day consultation with the employees' representatives required by law. The State will guarantee eligible employees statutory redundancy and certain outstanding wage entitlements via the redundancy and insolvency payment schemes. These schemes pay impacted workers a maximum of €600 per week for up to eight weeks where arrears are due in wages, holiday pay or minimum notice entitlements. Other creditors, including self-employed contractors, should make contact with the receivers in order to submit proof of debt and to file a claim regarding unpaid moneys. I just wanted to put those issues on the record of the Dáil.",

This is a very serious situation. It is dire. They are absolutely determined and, after a meeting yesterday, cautiously hopeful but they have nothing in writing to say the Government will agree to their very reasonable demands for access to a HAA medical card and a State contributory pension. In fact, what they have had from Government so far is the exact opposite. In the first instance, the Government voted against proposals from Sinn Féin and Catherine Connolly to grant all survivors access to these things. In early October, the Minister for education wrote to say there was no change to that position. Does the Tánaiste recognise the urgent need to resolve this matter? Will he bring this hunger strike to an end? Will he do the right thing by these survivors? Will he give them a written commitment to meet their demands today?"

A modern, equitable approach would be to consider distance-based, time variable tolling, tax relief for commuters or scrap it altogether.

It is very welcome that the first section of the scheme for the families who lost loved ones in that fire has been completed. However, lawyers for the survivors are getting very frustrated because they have not had an update on the redress scheme that was committed to well over a year ago. It is 44 years since that fire and these survivors are not getting any younger. Many of them are still living with serious and ongoing health problems that they sustained that night. I have submitted numerous parliamentary questions but I cannot get a clear answer on it. When does the Tánaiste expect the Minister to bring this scheme to Cabinet? When does he expect it to be rolled out? Can the Department be asked to open up communications with the lawyers on the whole process please?"

If we can get this right over the course of this Government, we can transform childcare in a way that other parts of society and our education system have been transformed in years gone by. The first step is that the Minister will before the end of the year publish an action plan for 2026, detailing what she believes we will be able to get done in 2026, what immediate measures can be taken with the allocations she received in the budget. Early in 2026, she will publish the comprehensive action plan that knits together the 22 commitments in the programme for Government and looks at how we get to the €200 per month per child, which is doable, and how we also make sure there are places, how we use our planning system to drive that, and how we empower parents, recognising it cannot be one-size-fits-all. Childminding works for some people, private crèches or community crèches work for others. A whole variety of situations can happen and we have to empower the parent as well.

A mediator met with them earlier this week. In between all of that, I have written to them a number of times and at every step of the way encouraged them to please come off their hunger strike. My first and foremost priority is their health and well-being. It is not a nice time of the year. At the same time, I appreciate what they have gone through. I have listened to many of their stories and understand the position they are in. I am asking that they would come off hunger strike. We will continue to engage with them in good faith. The work the mediator is doing now is based on engagement they had yesterday and we want to be able to come back to them as quickly as possible. However, there is an absolute desire on part of Government to try to resolve this as quickly as possible but above all that their health and well-being would be front and centre in all of this."

In that context, given that we are a representative democracy and we have occasional debates on this issue, in order to stop the manipulation on the far left side of the politics of identity and on the far right of the politics of hate, we need more debate. We need more debate. Yesterday, I asked whether the Government would consider a citizens' forum on this issue. A citizens' forum would include a lot of newcomer citizens who came to these shores and now are Irish citizens. They would be able to contribute to the debate. We can look at what our resources and our obligations are under UN conventions and what is and is not possible. Above all, it would put to bed a lot of the myths and misinformation and allow a proper, reasoned and respectful debate. Could that be done concurrently with any other discussion in these Houses?"

                "That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to require the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to produce a report on the appointment of an emergency independent inspector for Dublin Zoo.",
                "I am introducing this Bill in an effort to highlight a range of very serious issues at the zoo. None of them has been properly investigated, despite repeated attempts by concerned workers at the zoo to bring them to the attention, first, of management and HR and then of the Charities Regulator, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, and even An Garda Síochána. When journalists have asked questions about this, they have been met with legal letters. One journalist received no fewer than 11 legal letters, including a letter sent to their entire workplace. The issues include very serious animal welfare issues culminating in the deaths of numerous animals and the disappearance of whole species from the zoo. There are credible allegations of harassment, including sexual harassment, of zoo workers by managers. There are financial irregularities, of which I now have documentary proof, including the misallocation of funds raised in a Save Dublin Zoo appeal during Covid to build an extension to the zoo director's house. To cap it all, there was a lack of concern and a total lack of proper oversight by the State over any of this.",
                "This is not some faceless bureaucratic organisation. This is a national institution loved by generations of children and their families who go there believing the animals they see are being well cared for and that by going to the zoo, they are contributing to the conservation of endangered species around the world. It gives me no pleasure to say that for some of these animals this is far from the truth. Over the past few years, I have spoken on multiple occasions to zoo workers who are outraged at the neglect and mistreatment of animals in the zoo. To be clear, in most cases this is down to understaffing and a lack of proper training. It is the fault of zoo management, not at all of the workers. A recent example is the deaths of all the African wild dogs. This is an endangered species about whom welfare concerns were raised three years ago by NPWS inspectors, and by me in this House. This time, welfare concerns raised by experienced zoo keepers were not investigated in time and all the dogs died. One dog had cancer in the mouth that was left untreated and had to be put down. Before it died, it got no medication or medical intervention. Another was pregnant and became very swollen. Her lungs and heart became filled with fluid. She never recovered after being administered an anaesthetic and she died. That species is now gone from the zoo. The same thing happened with the wolves, which were all put down after a health check. That is two whole species gone from the zoo. Other animal deaths have included four bongo antelopes and a black buck whose leg was snapped in half and left hanging on by a ligament after being inappropriately transported in a horse box. This is a very small, fragile antelope who should never have been moved so roughly. Last weekend, a pregnant cheetah was moved from Fota Wildlife Park to Dublin Zoo at Hallowe'en. She gave birth the next day and all the baby cubs are now dead. She should never have been moved when pregnant. Another incident I have raised in the past was the drugging of a family of elephants that were cruelly separated by zoo management. Two of them died from stress and the rest of the remaining herd developed herpes reactivated by stress.",
                "Another serious problem at the zoo is harassment, including sexual harassment of workers and a refusal by HR to take appropriate action to protect staff. A female staff member repeatedly complained about being harassed by a male manager. He was eventually suspended for four months. During that time he was, on at least one occasion, sitting outside her house in a car late at night. This was reported to HR but nothing was done. When she returned to work, the manager followed her around in an intimidating manner. Nothing was done about that either. She was then the only person to be made redundant in the zoo while the male manager is still a senior member of staff. Last April, the same woman had a brick thrown through her front window. On a previous occasion, when I spoke about issues in Dublin Zoo in the Dáil, the tyres of her car were slashed. In another incident, three female members of staff were sexually harassed by a male manager at a conference. A subsequent HR investigation confirmed three instances of harassment. He is still a senior manager at the zoo.",
                "The final set of issues relate to the misallocation of funds raised by a Save Dublin Zoo appeal during Covid. An investigation by the Charities Regulator found that some of those funds were used to build an extension to the then zoo director's house. I have a letter from the zoo released only under freedom of information admitting that the funds were used for this extension. I also have an email from the Charities Regulator stating that it would not publish the Covid funds investigation because \"the publication of this information could be detrimental to the zoo's reputation\". Even if it did its job properly, the Charities Regulator's remit is limited and does not extend to animal welfare. An entirely new system of independent oversight is urgently needed. I hope this Bill can be the first step in developing that."

I acknowledge and thank Deputy Carthy, who is the Chairperson of the justice committee, for the fact that the committee has agreed to waive pre-legislative scrutiny of this short Bill. That is the appropriate decision to make, and I thank the members of the committee for agreeing to my request in that regard. I am conscious that the justice committee has a lot on its plate in terms of the legislation coming from my Department which does require pre-legislative scrutiny so I acknowledge publicly the work the committee does in that regard.",
                "The general purpose of this Bill is to increase the number of ordinary judges in four or the five jurisdictions that operate within our courts system. I want to increase the number of judges on the District Court, the Circuit Court, the High Court and the Court of Appeal. There is no proposal in this legislation to increase the number of judges who can sit on the Supreme Court. You will be aware, a Chathaoirligh, that, previously, the judicial planning working group had made a recommendation that the country required 44 new members of the Judiciary. The previous Government agreed with that decision and the current Government will continue with that process of appointment of 44 further judges. It has to be pointed out that the previous Government appointed 24 of those judges. The purpose of this legislation is to ensure we can have 20 more judges available for appointment. Members will also notice, however, that we are seeking the appointment of one extra judge on the Court of Appeal as well. The reason for that is the decision the Government made, agreed to by Mr. Justice Michael McGrath of the Court of Appeal, that he would chair the commission of investigation into the handling of historical child sexual abuse in day and boarding schools. I commend him on agreeing to do that, but it does mean that under this legislation I am seeking a total increase of 21 judges across the various courts.",
                "The Bill marks the second phase of legislation to allow for the recruitment of these additional judges and, as I have indicated, 24 of them have been appointed to date. It is important that we in this House all recognise that the reason we are seeking the appointment of more judges is not in order that people can become judges but in order to facilitate individuals in Ireland who seek access to the administration of justice and who require access to the courts. We know from research and experience that the impact of additional judges can be extremely positive in improving waiting times and cutting the backlogs that existed in our courts for very many years.",
                "The Bill provides for a number of technical amendments related to the Gambling Regulation Act 2024, the Family Courts Act 2024 and the Child Care Act 1991 to allow for the more efficient operation of those Acts when fully commenced.",
                "The general scheme of this Bill was approved by the Government in September 2025, and further consultation was undertaken with various Departments. The results of those discussions have been taken on board in the published Bill. For reasons of urgency, as I said, particularly in the case of the amendments to the Gambling Regulation Act, we sought a waiver in respect of pre-legislative scrutiny. As I said, I thank Deputy Carthy and members of the justice committee for agreeing to that.",
                "Before turning to the main provisions of the Bill, I want to point out the reason it is important that we appoint more judges to be available to hear cases. If we want to ensure that citizens and people seeking access to justice in our courts get access to decisions and judgments more quickly, it is essential that we appoint more judges. Judges are required to sit hearing very many cases, and that is the public-facing part of their job. Sometimes we forget, however, that at the end of a day sitting in court, a judge is required to go off and prepare paperwork, read further paperwork and, for the superior courts, prepare judgments in respect of complex issues that have been raised before them.",
                "I think everyone in the House agrees we are lucky in this country that we have an internationally recognised Judiciary. It is renowned for its integrity as well as its commercial awareness, fairness and sense of impartiality. Anyone who appears before an Irish court can, I think, be relatively satisfied that they will get a fair adjudication in respect of their claim. As Minister for justice, I am very much committed to ensuring that I try to improve access to the justice system for people in Ireland. In order to do that, I have to further modernise the courts. I also have to ensure that the facilities are in place to ensure that justice can be administered in those courts. I am the first Minister for justice to operate the appointment of judges under the new system that was given effect by the Judicial Appointments Commission Act. I have been able to appoint individuals to the District Court, the Circuit Court, the High Court and the Court of Appeal under that new process. I have no previous experience as to how the old system operated but, just from the point of view of informing Members of the House, I am pleased with the way the system that operates at present is operating. I think it is bringing forward individuals who are highly qualified for the purpose of judicial nomination by the Government. As you know, a Chathaoirligh, when a judicial vacancy is advertised, people are allowed to apply for that position. There is then an adjudication of those applications by the Judicial Appointments Commission. It conducts interviews in respect of a number of individuals who have applied and then it sends to me a list of three names, not in any order of preference, from which I have to make a recommendation to the Government that we nominate one of the three persons. If there is more than one vacancy, a greater number of names are provided. If there are two vacancies on a court, I will get five names. I think there are two for every three others that are identified there.",
                "Traditional resourcing is essential to ensuring that the courts can administer justice efficiently and effectively for all our citizens. As I stated to the House at the outset, this Bill will give effect to the judicial party working group's recommendations to increase the number of judges. We have seen already that 24 have been appointed, and the purpose here is to appoint another 21.",
                "In terms of court sittings, we can see that there has been a marked improvement as a result of the appointment of further judges. There has been an increase of 14% in the District Court, an increase of 28% in the Circuit Court and an increase of 18% in the High Court. There are some improvements that are worth noting and that probably do not get sufficient recognition. We have seen a 33% increase in family law cases resolved in the District Court, a 13% increase in criminal cases resolved in the District Court and a 6.5% increase in civil cases resolved in the Circuit Court. Waiting times for civil trials in the Circuit Court have gone down from 50 weeks in 2023 to 31 weeks in 2025. We have also seen that waiting times for criminal appeals in the Circuit Court are down from 33 weeks to 24 weeks and there has been a 5.9% increase in resolved cases in the High Court between 2022 and 2025. It is also important to point out that the waiting time for bail cases in the High Court has decreased from 104 weeks in 2022 to 41 weeks in 2025, and priority custody cases decreased from 70 weeks to 28 weeks over the same period. The increase in the numbers of judges hearing cases is obviously resulting in greater productivity and greater numbers of judgments. Of course, it is also putting pressures on other areas within my Department. Because we now have the Central Criminal Court sitting so much more frequently than was the case previously, more people are finding themselves sentenced to terms of imprisonment for serious offences. The increase in judicial numbers obviously has a knock-on effect on other areas such as prisons.",
                "It is important to note that there are training days for judges who are appointed now across all jurisdictions. That is important to ensure that judges are attuned to the needs of victims and equipped to deal with the increasing complexity in areas of specialisation that is now apparent in the law.",
                "Obviously, the purpose of this House is to enact legislation along with the Seanad and the President. However, every time we create a new law, generally within it we are providing a criminal sanction. Where we do that - or even if we do not provide a criminal sanction but just provide a civil remedy - necessarily we will find ourselves creating more potential disputes because the law has been increased and set down as requiring certain obligations to be performed either in the State sector or in the private sector and that will result in more complaints that the law has not been complied with. That will require more judicial adjudication.",
                "On the provisions of the Bill itself, section 1 is the standard Short Title and the commencement section. Section 2 provides for the repeal of sections 263 and 271 of the Gambling Regulation Act 2024. That is being done for a particular purpose. The purpose was now being given effect to by section 10 of the Bill, which I will refer to presently. Section 2 also provides for the repeal of sections 31 and 33 of the Family Courts Act 2024, which are no longer required. This section also provides for the repeal of various parts of section 80 of the Family Courts Act to account for additional amendments to the Child Care Act 1991 as provided for in section 9 of this Act. Section 3 provides relevant definitions for Part 2 of the Bill.",
                "Section 4 provides for the amendment of paragraph section 1A(2) of the Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Act 1961 and increases the statutory limit on the number of ordinary judges of the Court of Appeal by three, rising from 18 to 21. Section 4 provides regulatory power to increase the number of judges on the Court of Appeal by one judge for operational reasons in line with the same existing powers for the High Court. If it is the case in the future that a Court of Appeal judge is requested by the Government to do some other statutory functions, such as a commission of investigation, it will hopefully not be necessary for us to come back to seek extra judge to be set out in legislation for that judge to be replaced. Section 4 provides a degree of flexibility within the Court of Appeal, and it mirrors the provisions that exists in respect of the High Court.",
                "Section 5 provides the Government the flexibility to appoint a judge permanently to a particular district and allows for a number of unassigned judges that can be assigned temporarily as need arises. It provides for an amendment to section 2(1)(b) of the sixth Schedule of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act 1961, increasing the number of unassigned judges by six, rising from 28 to 34, in line with increases of overall numbers of District Court judges. When somebody is appointed as a District Court judge they may or may not be assigned to a particular district. For certain parts of the country, it is imperative that we have District Court judges assigned to them in areas which are more remote and where it is absolutely necessary to have a judge assigned there to ensure that if something arises and somebody needs to be brought before a court immediately, we have a judge there. However, there are many unassigned judges who perform a role within the District Court and where they go to wherever the workload is required under the direction of the president of the District Court.",
                "Section 6 provides for an amendment to section 9 of the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995 and increases the statutory limit on the number of ordinary judges of the High Court by six, rising from 49 to 55, in line with Government commitments. It is necessary that there are that number of judges in the High Court because of the increasing workload that is being imposed on High Court judges as a result in many respects of the expansion of the legislative framework that exists in this country. There are a huge number of laws being generated each year. Every time we create a law there is a requirement that they be adjudicated on where there is a dispute.",
                "Section 7 provides for the amendment to section 10 of the Courts and Court Officers Act and increases the number of ordinary judges of the Circuit Court by six. That will rise from 45 to 51. Section 8 provides for the amendment to section 10 of the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995 and increases the number of ordinary judges of the District Court by six, rising from 71 to 77, in line with Government commitments. District judges are really the judges who are at the coal face of the administration of justice in Ireland. Most people who find themselves in a situation where they have to encounter the justice system, they do it through an encounter in the District Court, which deals with most of the legal issues that arise for people that require them to before the courts.",
                "Part 3 deals with technical amendments relating to the Child Care Act 1991. Section 9 provides for amendments to section 12 of the Child Care Act to update the District Court to the Family District Court, previously provided for in section 80(b) of the Family Courts Act 2024. Section 9 further provides for amendments to update provisions in the Child Care Act that contain references to \"a justice\" or to \"a judge\". This was previously for in section 80 of the Family Courts Act, which is repealed by section 2.",
                "Part 4 deals with amendments relating to the Gambling Regulation Act 2024. It is the case that the reason for the urgency in this legislation is that I want to ensure the legislation in place in respect of gambling regulation can be amended in the slight technical way that it is in this Bill as it is necessary to do that in order that the Gambling Regulatory Authority of Ireland, which is doing great work, can continue to meet the timelines it has set for itself and to even advance further in its licensing of entities under that legislation.",
                "Section 10 provides for the amendment of section 1 of the Street and House Collections Act 1962 to amend the definitions of \"collection\" and \"exempt activity\" to refer to the Gambling Regulation Act 2024 rather than the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956. Section 11 provides for an amendment to section 1(2) of the Gambling Regulation Act, which contains a cross-reference to section 9 of that Act where it should have referred to section 10. Section 10 of that Act permits the Minister to repeal or revoke those statutory provisions underpinning the existing licensing framework for gambling, which are contained in the Totalisator Act 1929, the Betting Act 1931, the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 and in related statutory instruments.",
                "It is the authority's intention to begin accepting applications for certain types of betting licences in the coming months. The repeal of both the 1929 and 1931 Acts will ensure that all applications for new betting licences must be made to the authority under the 2024 Act. Not doing so would result in the introduction of a dual licensing system, whereby an applicant for a betting licence could circumvent the enhanced regulatory regime introduced in the 2024 Act by obtaining licences under the 1929 or 1931 Acts. The section also includes further minor technical and drafting amendments to several sections of the 2024 Act.",
                "This Bill is intended to increase the number of judges in the various courts to further ensure the courts can administer justice efficiently and effectively for all our citizens. The enactment of the Bill will lead to further efficiencies in the courts system. It will improve the progress of accessing justice by members of the public. It will provide improved waiting times across all courts. It will provide for more timely judgments and contribute to better clearance rates. It will provide opportunities for training and development for members of the Judiciary. It will also provide an updating of the Gambling Regulation Act, so that the Gambling Regulatory Authority of Ireland can operate as fully as possible to ensure that licences can and are provided for where they meet the statutory test. I will have the opportunity to listen to colleagues and I will respond to what they have to say."

                "Cuirim fáilte roimh an deis labhairt ar an Bhille seo. One of the key problems within the justice system is the length of time that it takes for court cases to be heard and that often means that victims and their families are forced to wait far too long to get justice. There are particularly lengthy delays in respect of sexual violence cases, which of course increases the trauma for victims. It impacts on the abilities of victims, survivors and their families to get about rebuilding their lives. Court delays contribute to other problems, including a matter that we have discussed on a number on occasions, which is the huge number of crimes that are being committed by those who are on bail. That is due to the larger number of people who are on bail awaiting court cases and then the high number on remand.",
                "The Law Society of Ireland has highlighted the fact that cases in this State currently take 1.5 times longer than the European average. It pointed out that too few judges and court staff are tasked with managing a disproportionately high caseload, further exacerbating delays and undermining the system's effectiveness. By numerous bodies, Ireland has been criticised for the low number of judges that we have. The EU justice scoreboard, for example, this year shows that for the past decade Ireland had the lowest number of judges per capita across all EU states. Therefore, we welcome the increase in the numbers of judges as provided for in this legislation.",
                "I make the point strongly to the Minister that there needs to be a corresponding increase in Courts Service staff to ensure delays are reduced. We need to look at the physical infrastructure of the courts that has also been identified as inadequate in many instances to meet the challenge and needs of the justice system.",
                "Issues have been highlighted by the Law Society and others in terms of privacy, for example, around family law cases and how the physical infrastructure in the courts, in many cases, restricts their ability to operate effectively. In addition to increasing the number of judges, the other factors increasing court delays need to be addressed as a matter of urgency.",
                "As we look at how the court system operates, we also need to look at the wider experience of those who have reason to be in the courts such as the jurors, witnesses and victims. I raised with the Minister the need to introduce a payment to compensate for the costs of those who serve on our juries. The absence of such a payment impacts on people who are, in many cases, already struggling with cost of living, as well as those with caring responsibilities and the self-employed. I have raised this previously with the Minister. He has pointed out that the self-employed and full-time carers can be excused from jury service but it is not good enough that those groups are then under-represented on our juries. Those who wish to serve should have that option and those on low incomes should not be out of pocket for carrying out their civic duties. It is 12 years since the Law Reform Commission called for the introduction of what would be a modest, flat rate daily payment to cover the cost of transport and other incidentals involved in attending jury service. That has also been very strongly supported by the Law Society. I ask again that the Minister look at this issue to bring forward proposals to address the cost incurred by those who undertake their civic duty by serving on juries.",
                "There is also clearly a need for greater support for victims and survivors for whom the court process is naturally very traumatic. I acknowledge that supports have improved but we must also acknowledge that much more needs to be done. The specific issue of the lack of court-leave was raised by a number of those who have gone through the judicial system as victims and witnesses. I was struck when this was raised over the summer by the sisters, Paula Fay and Catherine Wrightstone, following the conviction of their brother for sexually abusing them. Ms Fay reported that when she told her employer she was going to be a witness in a trial and that it could take three weeks, she was told she was only entitled to use her annual leave or seek unpaid leave. The fact such an entitlement exists in other states shows it is widely recognised as important. It is something I ask the Minister to examine with a view to introducing such an entitlement here. Having spoken to many victims who have been through the judicial process, there have been a range of experiences. Some have been very complimentary of the supports they have received but all, by the nature of their experiences, find the process traumatic. A number pointed out the supports they felt should be in place were simply were not, and we need to address that.",
                "Victims of sexual violence need specific support. How difficult the process is for many of those has been highlighted multiple times. Rape Crisis Ireland has been running the national accompaniment programme which has been funded by the Minister's Department for over 15 years. The Department started funding some centres to deliver a professional model of delivery but did not roll this out beyond Dublin which resulted in a two-tier system for survivors. Rape Crisis Ireland is looking for the model to be moved from a volunteer-based one to a fully professionalised delivery that has equal access across the State to help minimise the impact of secondary traumatisation and to empower and encourage survivors to stay with the case as it progresses through the judicial process. I ask the Minister to look again at this issue with a view to implementing and funding the proposal put forward by Rape Crisis Ireland.",
                "The legislation makes some technical amendments related to the Child Care Act 1991 and the Child and Family Agency. I want to take this opportunity to make a number of brief comments on Tusla. We have seen a litany of issues occurring over Tusla's remit in recent months and years. Frankly, they are alarming. There have been too many incidents involving children in State care. Over the past year alone too many children were failed and too many children have gone missing. An inspection of Tusla's separated children seeking international protection service discovered that in January and February of this year, approximately 30 children were missing. Too many children have died. There is the case of Kyran Durnin who is missing and presumed dead. There is the case of Daniel Aruebose whose skeletal remains were found in Donabate in September and the case of Vladym Davydenko who was killed at a Tusla care facility in Dublin last month. Then, of course, there was the horrific incident of the ten-year-old girl who went missing and was sexually assaulted at Citywest. I want to repeat the very serious concerns about how such a young girl, who was obviously a vulnerable child, could end up going missing and remain missing overnight while the public were not been informed. The language used in the statement issued by Tusla in the aftermath of that incident was deeply concerning to many people. It verged on victim blaming. The word \"absconding\" was used for a child which is language we use for escaped criminals, not for vulnerable children who have gone missing from State care. There has to be a full and thorough investigation of that incident. This and other recent cases I have mentioned must serve as a wake-up call for us as Oireachtas Members. Tusla is failing in its purpose. As elected representatives, the people we interact with are telling us of negative experiences, by and large. People generally do not approach us to say they have had a good experience with State services but I have never met anybody who said their experience with Tusla has been positive. There are serious and fundamental issues there that we need to address as a matter of urgency.",
                "We have heard how the inspection by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, of Tusla services in the south east found the capacity of the service to provide a quality, safe and effective foster care service had not improved since the previous inspection in February 2024. It was reported that one child in Tusla care had eight social workers in two and a half years. Dealing with the concerns around Tusla must be an urgent piece of business.",
                "In respect of the technical amendments to the gambling regulations contained in this Bill, I want to bring to the Minister's attention what appears to be a disregard of legislation that is currently in place. I know we are moving towards the enactment of the more recent gambling legislation. However, if somebody goes on to their social media or Facebook account right now, they will see an advertisement for a raffle where, with the stroke of a button, they can enter into a draw for a house, a car, or, in some cases, tens of thousands of euro. Those lotteries are operating outside of the law as it currently stands. It appears to me that nobody is paying any attention to it. We need to address that. If we have laws in place and they need to be changed or are not fit for purpose, let us address them. However, if people are blatantly breaking the law, then we need to address that. Sinn Féin will be supporting this Bill."

                "One of the main problems within the justice system is the length of time it takes for court cases to be heard. Justice delayed is justice denied. These long delays in relation to sexual violence cases increase the trauma for victims. I was at a very emotive briefing today, hosted by my colleague, Deputy Carthy, where we heard very powerful testimonies from women who were victims of sexually based violence. One thing that struck me, which is directly related to the legislation we are discussing today, is that only 5% of all cases of sexual assaults make it to court. I cannot help thinking if we had a faster, victim-based judicial process, we would see this number increase. I hope this Bill will go some way in helping this process. The briefing I was at was about victims of sexual violence and the civil protection orders. This will be debated in this House on 25 November. It is no coincidence that 25 November is international day of the elimination of violence against women.",
                "For the 5% of the victims and survivors who make it to court, the challenges do not end when the court case ends, even when there is a conviction. The women today spoke about the fear they feel as their assailants come to the end of their sentences. They fear contact from perpetrators and fear encountering the perpetrator as they go about their daily lives. What I heard today is that something as simple and humane as a court imposing a restraining order on the person convicted of sexual assault from approaching the victim would go a long way in making the victim feel safer. I am urging cross-party support for the Bill on 25 November.",
                "There are provisions in the Bill we are discussing today to speed up the judicial process.",
                "Victims of sexual violence are our families, friends and neighbours and live under a range of circumstances. They may have families, loved ones, friends, jobs, illnesses, exams and bills – all of the everyday dilemmas big and small that people deal with on a daily basis all over Ireland. Having been a victim of sexual violence and then experiencing an inhumane delay in getting justice in the courts can become too much. We need to make this process victim friendly and I hope the increase in the number of judges and supports for courts will make this happen so that women may become survivors and are not just victims.",
                "Every time I speak on this issue, I am conscious about using the terms \"survivor\" and \"victim\". The term \"victim\" describes a person who has been subject to a crime. However, this does not imply any weakness, assume any guilt or assign any blame. The term \"survivor\" can be used as a term of empowerment to convey that a person has started the healing process. People who have experienced sexual violence do not have to be either one or the other; they can be who they want. They can also be both. The women I heard speak today at the briefing were, quite simply, heroes.",
                "The Bill also seeks to make amendments to the Child Care Act and the Family Courts Act in regard to Tusla. It seeks to extend childcare by Tusla when there is an upcoming court case and I have concerns about this, which have already been relayed. A ten-year-old child was recently sexually assaulted while under the care of Tusla, which took place in Citywest, in my constituency. People want to know how a ten-year-old girl under the care of Tusla could go missing. It is a legitimate question.",
                "There is a disturbing pattern of children in the care of Tusla being failed. We think of six-year-old Kyran Durnin, missing and presumed dead, three-year-old Daniel Aruebose, whose skeletal remains were found in Donabate, and 17-year-old Vadym Davydenko, who was stabbed to death in an unregulated Tusla care facility. People have asked me what is going on with Tusla. Tusla needs to examine how it responded publicly to the case of the ten-year-old girl. It stated that the girl had been voluntarily placed into care by her family earlier this year due to significant behavioural issues. This is victim blaming. It went on to say that the child had absconded from care. Prisoners escape and abscond. Ten-year-old children do not. Again, this is victim blaming. Tusla, which is meant to care for some of those vulnerable children in society, needs to take a long hard look at itself. I also call for an immediate public inquiry into this matter. In the context of the Bill, I have concerns about the ability of Tusla to look after vulnerable children any longer than is necessary."

As has been said by my colleagues, and it will be said by many others, the major issue is that the system is not fit for purpose in that court cases in the State can take at least one and a half times longer than the European average. Obviously, that should not be the case. As Deputy Carthy said, we need to make sure not only that we have more judges but also that we have all of the adequate staff to deliver something that is a bit more fit for purpose. We all know justice should be swift, and that is an absolute right. The Bill needs to be expedited insofar as possible.",

I commend Deputy Carthy on the presentation in the audiovisual room earlier with victims and survivors of sexual violence. I would like to think there would be support across the House for the Bill and the simple idea of civil protection orders being provided to those who have been through absolute hell and need vital support. We are talking about those who are survivors and the victims of sexual and gender-based and domestic violence.",

We need to do everything to remove this issue from society as much as possible.",

I do not think many here would not raise issues in respect of safeguarding. There are proposed changes to the Child Care Act and the Child and Family Agency Act. The only thing we can say about Tusla in the past while is that, unfortunately, people who thought they could not be shocked have been absolutely shocked by the ongoing investigations into Kyran Durnin, Daniel Aruebose and the shocking case of the ten-year-old girl who was sexually assaulted while under the care of Tusla.",
                "I would add my voice to those of my colleagues in respect of the disgraceful language used by Tusla in talking about a child having absconded. This is an utterly vulnerable child who was under the protection of the State, and the State failed miserably. We need to make sure that there is follow-up and that we have a system that is fit for purpose and far more robust than what we are talking about at the minute.",
                "We have spoken many times about the fact we do not have a system that is fit for purpose in terms of the supports required by families and children. In some cases, we have left children in really difficult circumstances. It is not just about those who are in care; it is also about the fact that we have not put support structures in place. We need to consider this holistically. In many cases, we can carry out interventions at a very early stage when they would be a lot less nuclear than what is sometimes needed at a later stage. We can ensure that family units stay together. Beyond that, we could provide children with a far better life that could lead to worthwhile engagement with society, including education, employment and all of the rest. I hope we will not deal with such dreadful situations again. We need the full information on the case of Vadym Davydenko.

                "The Labour Party will support the Bill and we hope we can expedite it through the Houses. The Bill is based on the recommendations of the judicial planning working group. This is phase 2 of the recommendations, dealing with the addition of 21 judges. I have to acknowledge the improvements to the various different courts. The Minister read them into the record of the Dáil and I will not repeat them, but they need to be acknowledged. Nevertheless, the Council of Europe report has said that we are still way below the required volume of judges required when compared with our European colleagues, so we still have a bit of work to do on this. While the Bill is a step in the right direction, we will have to go again. We will have to see how the Bill works.",
                "The spending per inhabitant on the courts in our jurisdiction is significantly less than in others. It takes 1.5 times longer for the various courts to sit. While acknowledging that the timescales in many of the courts have reduced and many cases have been expedited, there are still issues.",
                "In relation to the issues that have been outlined by other colleagues regarding sexual crimes, etc., we really need see how we can itemise these to bring them forward and deal with them in a quicker and more compassionate way. I would be willing to work with the Minister on that. I do not think there is a monopoly of ideas on it. I welcome the fact a colleague from Sinn Féin put forward a proposal that will certainly go through as well. We all need to look at every angle we can in this regard.",
                "I will talk a little bit about resources and the courthouses. Where are we in relation to resources in the courts? The Minister might in his reply outline the staffing levels. If he has any updated statistics on staffing levels across the courts, they would be welcome. There have been a number of issues regarding various courthouses, some of which are in my own county, and the condition of courthouses, etc. What is the plan for working with the Office of Public Works, OPW, in relation to those? The Minister might give us some information on that as well.",
                "I want to raise a couple of issues in relation to An Garda Síochána and its workings in the courts. Earlier in the year, when the Minister was not long in the job, he spoke about hoping to make a number of changes with regard to how An Garda Síochána was going to work in the courts. The Future of Policing in Ireland report had a number of recommendations in this regard, some of which were accepted and some of which were not. I actually did not have much issue with them not being accepted. However, we need to look at how we can free up An Garda Síochána. I presume, given the issues we have with recruitment and retention and numbers in An Garda Síochána, that the Minister agrees with me on this. We need to look at how we are going to free up An Garda Síochána more within the courts.",
                "I was very taken with what the Minister said - it must be well over six months ago now, from memory - about the use of digitisation and documentation and how we were going to use digitisation on various charge sheets, bench warrants and a whole range of other things. Where are we in relation to that? Again, the Minister might update us on that. I would be hugely supportive of this. I know a number of gardaí who have worked in the Garda presenter role in the courts. As the Minister knows, there have been issues with that, which have been outlined by certain judges, and we were in no man's land for a while in relation to this. Where are we at as regards how we can look at freeing up An Garda Síochána in the courts? What is the future of the Garda presenter role? Are we moving towards digitisation? Do we need to bring in legislation for how we deal with this? I would say it is a possibility that we would. It is a strong possibility that we will have to do so because otherwise people would be at the mercy of certain courts and certain judges making their own decisions on it under the current legislation as laid down. The Minister might come back to us on that. I would like to know some figures in relation to the resources in the courts. I would like to know about any works through the OPW. In particular, I would like to see where we are going with regard to freeing up gardaí, digitisation, the future role of An Garda Síochána and court presenters and all of that. All in all, the Labour Party will be very much supporting this Bill and looking for its speedy introduction."

                "I welcome the contributions that have been made on this important Bill so far this afternoon. I commend the vision and efficiency that the Government has shown in progressing this Bill, which will fulfil the second phase of a multiyear plan to increase the number of judges. While those who work to administer justice in Ireland are among the hardest working individuals in the country, by increasing the number of judges available to hear cases, we can provide a further boost to their efforts.",
                "Recent reports from the Council of Europe’s European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice, as well as the judicial planning working group, JPWG, found that Ireland had the lowest per capita number of judges in the EU, at 3.3 per 100,000 inhabitants. This compares with a European average of 22.2. In real terms, this translated to delays in Ireland’s judicial system, and in the past has worked to slow down the work of the system. As we know, justice delayed is justice denied. However, in response to these findings, both this Government and its predecessor chose to act decisively, committing to an increase in judge numbers from 173 to 217 over two phases. The first phase, enacted when An Tánaiste was serving as the Minister for Justice in 2023, created 24 new judges and brought with it immediate benefits. These included a reduction in the backlog of criminal summonses awaiting scheduling from over 61,000 at the start of 2023 to just over 7,000 by mid-2024. As well as this, the cancellation of District Court sittings was largely eliminated by the beginning of last year, there was a 17% increase in Circuit Court sittings around the country and waiting times for judicial review in the High Court dropped from 13 weeks to three weeks. Clearly, therefore, the changes made under the 2023 Act worked to greatly increase the capacity of the system to the extent that by the beginning of last year, as many as 12 Central Criminal Court jury trials were running concurrently, which was an all-time high.",
                "This Bill then, which aims to add 20 judges to the courts system, does so on the back of an enormous amount of positive evidence. While this will no doubt be welcome and will go a long way towards improving how justice is administered in Ireland, we must remember that this Bill is a step in the right direction, but there is still more to be done. The JPWG report concludes, “Additional numbers in further phases should be determined by a review in 2025 of judicial needs up to 2028.\" Indeed, it has been noted by those in the judicial profession that increasing the number of judges is not the answer to all workload challenges and must take place alongside broader reforms of the justice system, as proposed by the reports above.",
                "The Government has shown a willingness to act when it comes to providing a future plan for the justice system, and I have no doubt that as that plan is enacted, further consideration will be giving to the supplementary staffing requirements that go alongside an increase in the numbers of judges. I also welcome the Bill’s intention to amend the Street and House to House Collections Act 1962, the Child Care Act 1991 and the Gambling Regulation Act 2024, to repeal certain provisions of the Family Courts Act 2024, and to provide for related matters. These technical amendments are important measures that will improve these Acts’ operation and provide clarity on points of contention.",
                "To conclude, I warmly welcome the Government’s work to increase the capacity of the justice system and I commend the provisions of this Bill, which aims to build upon the proven success of phase 1 to further improve the efficiency of our courts system. The Government has shown real ambition in improving the everyday operation of justice in Ireland, and I look forward to engaging with the justice sector on future developments of the system."

                "I thank the Minister for bringing forward the Bill. It is a technical one that tidies up provisions across our courts and civil law system, and we will, of course, be supporting it. However, I want to use the opportunity, when we have a Bill that is to do with the appointment of more judges, to talk not about the structures of the courts but about the culture that exists within them, particularly when it comes to sentencing and rehabilitation. If we are serious about justice and the administration of it in this country, we have to be honest about the fact that they are still far too slow to use community-based alternatives that actually work.",
                "Last year, South East Technological University, in research commissioned by the Department of Justice, examined how judges view community service orders. What it found is incredibly instructive for our work here. Judges, particularly outside of Dublin, continue to rely on short custodial sentences, of less than 12 months, even though every piece of evidence tells us they do nothing to reduce reoffending. Many judges interviewed admitted they had little information about how community service works in practice - for instance, about completion rates, programme quality or supports for people with addiction or mental health issues. One judge who was interviewed for the research said plainly that they would love to know how community service is analysed, which courses are rehabilitative, and which are suitable for people with addiction or mental health issues. This is absolutely not intended to be a criticism of judges - far from it. It is an indictment of the lack of feedback, judicial education and resources around community sanctions. That same excellent piece of research highlighted that almost half of District Court judges do not have a probation officer regularly sitting in their court, and just as many lack access to community service suitability reports.",
                "It recommended that all courts should have access to community service suitability reports without delay and same-day reports and pre-sanction assessments should be available to every judge in every district. That is a simple, powerful reform that would make many more community sentences a real option instead of an aspiration. At the justice committee meeting this week, we heard about some of the innovations that take places in the specialist Children Court in Dublin. We were then told those innovations are not available elsewhere. That is a real omission and something we should look to rectify. Another study for the Judicial Council by SETU reached the same conclusion that judges need sentencing guidelines on non-custodial sanctions, better training on alternatives to custody and a major reinvestment in the Probation Service to provide pre-sanction reports and community projects in every part of the country. Those are not radical ideas; they are practical, evidence-based solutions to ensure we do not keep using short-term prison sentences that in fact achieve very little. Judges in every court should have the tools, training and information to see probation and community sanctions not as letting someone off but as a structured, supervised path out of reoffending.",
                "I acknowledge there has been progress. The latest report from Restorative Justice shows that referrals to restorative programmes increased in 2024 and provision expanded to new counties, which should be welcomed, but there are still counties that have no specialist restorative provider. Most victims are never even offered to choice to take part and the vast majority of Garda cautions remain non-restorative in nature. The progress is real but it is still limited and very localised. If we are appointing new judges, this is the moment to reshape the judicial culture to ensure rehabilitation and restorative approaches are seen not as a leniency but as justice done well. We need a re-investment in the Probation Service, sentencing guidelines and a judicial bench book that includes community and non-custodial sanctions and joint training between the Judiciary, Probation Service and restorative justice providers. The difference between community or custody is about whether our courts become a conveyor belt into overcrowded prisons or a place that genuinely gives people the tools to change. A short prison sentence may satisfy the demand for punishment but rarely serves the public interest in the long term; community sanctions, when properly understood and resourced, are infinitely better. We have talked quite a bit about recidivism rates which are extraordinarily high even by European standards. If we get the court culture right and provide alternatives to prisons across Ireland, that could make things a lot better. I welcome the Bill."

                "I thank all Members who made contributions. I listened to them very carefully. Deputy Carthy started off talking about long delays in cases that involve sexual violence. I think Deputies Ward and Ó Murchú mentioned that as well. It can be the case that there are lengthy delays when it comes to complaints made to An Garda Síochána about sexual offences. If we think about what the Garda is required to do and the time it can take for a victim to come forward to An Garda Síochána, sometimes allegations of complaints of sexual violence and sexual assault can be historical, as we have seen with the commission into sexual violence in secondary schools to which I referred earlier. That poses significant challenges for An Garda Síochána. Gardaí have to go off and interview people, try to get information relevant to many years previously, which can result in allegations of sexual violence taking longer to investigate. I am also conscious that when An Garda Síochána gets a complaint of sexual violence, it investigates it very thoroughly. I know everyone in the House is anxious to ensure cases come on for hearing as quickly as possible but An Garda Síochána has to do an investigation, get evidence, statements and put the allegations to the individual against whom allegations have been made. When it has done that, it makes a recommendation on its file and sends the file off to the DPP. The DPP then has to consider the file and make a determination as to whether she believes there is sufficient evidence for a prosecution and the likelihood of success. They are all complicated factors.",
                "Notwithstanding that, we in this House can try to speed the process up by ensuring if those steps are taken promptly, they know a court and judge will be available very quickly thereafter to hear the criminal prosecution. That is in effect what we are doing today. However, it is important to point out we cannot speed up every aspect of the criminal justice system because some of it is dependent upon evidence being gathered by An Garda Síochána and consideration of a file by the DPP. That in some cases takes time. There are other examples, which I am increasingly impressed with, where we see a criminal offence take place, the Garda arrests take place fairly rapidly after that, a file is completed by the Garda and we are now getting on to prosecutions sometimes between 12 and 18 months after the criminal act. We have sometimes seen that in the Criminal Courts of Justice. That is a very fast return when it comes to getting cases before the courts to have them determined promptly. I commend people in this House who speak up for survivors. I speak up for survivors and victims whenever I get that opportunity. From the courts' point of view and from our point of view in terms of legislation, it has to be recognised as well that we have to ensure there is a fair trial. We cannot take legislative steps that will result in the fairness of the trial being brought into question. I know everyone in this House agrees with me. Deputy Carthy also talked about how we have the lowest number of judges per capita in Europe. I think Deputy Callaghan referred to that as well. We need more judges, which is the purpose of the legislation. However, I urge a sense of caution when comparing Irish judicial numbers with what is referred to as EU judicial numbers. In the civil law system on the European Continent, they would count as judges people in this jurisdiction we would probably view as prosecutors. One has to be careful when looking at the bald statistics that make us look as though we are a complete outlier; the difference in our legal system and categorisation of people as judges can result in those numbers standing out significantly. Notwithstanding that, we certainly need more judges appointed.",
                "Deputy Carthy, and I think Deputies Ward and Ó Murchú, also referred to Tusla. Tusla is not within my statutory responsibility. I am not saying that to try to avoid discussing it. It has a very difficult task. One of my colleagues made a contribution about how we only hear from Tusla when issues have arisen that go wrong. We are never going to hear of things that have gone well from Tusla's point of view. I think people will agree Tusla has an extremely challenging task. Regrettably, there are thousands of children who fall within its responsibility. When something goes wrong, it is held to account for it but we need to recognise the extent of the challenge it has and that when it provides a service that goes well, we just generally do not hear about it.",
                "Deputy Carthy also spoke about the gambling regulator which is being dealt with in the legislation.",
                "Deputy Ward spoke about the elimination of violence against women. I want to bring to his attention that I got approval from Government a couple of weeks ago in respect of a new sexual offences Bill. That will change the law on consent for rape and sexual assault. At present, the law in respect of consent is that if the accused honestly believed they had consent, that is sufficient. That is a subjective test - the person thought the woman was consenting. That test will be changed and we are going to introduce an objective test that will be reasonably based. It will be an objective, reasonable test. That will improve the circumstance of victims who come before the courts.",
                "I disagree with Deputy Ó Murchú when he said the justice system is not fit for purpose. Every day of the week in this country, whether it is the District Court, the Circuit Court, the High Court or indeed the appeal courts, justice is being administered by judges.",
                "There are practitioners in there and we can see it in our newspapers every day, people being brought before the courts. The system operates very efficiently and effectively and it is important that it does. It is one of the arms of government. We have the executive arm, here we have the legislative arm but there is also the judicial arm. It is probably the least resourced of those three arms of government. It does a job on a daily basis and does it well in terms of the challenges it faces. It is important for us to ensure we provide greater supports to them and that is what we are doing today. I welcome the fact every Member of the House has agreed further judges will improve greater efficiencies.",
                "Deputy Kelly asked me a couple of questions on improvements in the courts and resources. He asked about the capital project for the courts. I want to try to ensure we have capital available to build new courthouses. A lot of new courthouses were built in recent years but the main priority is to get Hammond Lane up and running. There is also a commitment for a new courthouse in Tralee. These are just two examples where I want to see a continuation of progress. Deputy Kelly also spoke about An Garda Síochána. He mentioned several measures I mentioned to him about six months ago. They are coming. They are within the criminal justice and civil law miscellaneous provisions Bill, a different miscellaneous provisions Bill to this one. It is one I hope to be able to introduce in the next couple of months and I have approval from Government for it. At present, it is being drafted in the Attorney General's office and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government. Those issues regarding digitalisation and freeing up garda resources from the courts will be available there. On the issue of garda presenters, I hear very much what Deputy Kelly has said but before I do anything like that, there has to be resources in the DPP to take over the significant amount of work the gardaí do at present very efficiently and effectively.",
                "Deputy Callaghan welcomed the Bill and I note what she said about judges. I have dealt with that previously with regard to their numbers. Deputy Gannon made some contributions in respect of community service orders. It will also be the case in that miscellaneous provisions Bill I hope to bring forward in the forthcoming months that there will be a new statutory requirement in respect of community service orders. There is now going to be a situation in place where if a judge imposes a sentence of up two years, they will have to consider a community service order. The amount of that community service order can also increase from 240 hours to 480.",
                "For the record, the Probation Service does an excellent job. It probably does not get much recognition for the work it does but it does a huge amount of work, particularly in the area of children who come before the courts. I had a meeting the other day with senior officials from An Garda Síochána who are responsible for responding to youth crime. Again, we do not hear about it but there are some very positive results from the juvenile liaison officers and in diverting people from the path of crime."

I ask that anything we discuss be relayed to the Minister and the NCSE. This is incredibly important to all concerned, to the school community, staff, parents and most of all to the children who will not be able to avail of SNA support because a review has indicated that they were not successful. I will run through some of the timeline and give context and emphasise some of the frustrations on everyone's behalf in relation to the process. This is a thriving school in a rural area in Meath. It was unsuccessful in an initial SNA exceptional review, which took place in February 2025. The school considered an appeal and subsequently decided to apply for a focused review as it was aware, as we would have been ourselves, of significant needs in the incoming junior infants class in September 2025. Parents and staff identified this additional need.",
                    "They were told in May that the NCSE was no longer accepting applications for reviews as guidance was changing and that is the piece we all would have been aware of. In August they were told they could reapply for an interim review for the incoming students who were not considered in the review back in February. The deadline for that application was 31 August and the school put in a very comprehensive application. Despite the guidelines stating that it would hear back within two weeks - this was at the end of August - it still had no word as recently as a couple of days ago.",
                    "The Minister, Deputy McEntee, a constituency colleague of mine, visited this school on 10 October. The school staff pursued it. I also pursued it and I am sure other elected representatives from across the political spectrum pursued it on behalf of the school. Just yesterday or the day before, two months on from the initial application, it received the letter from the NCSE saying that the review was unsuccessful. This was a devastating and demoralising.",
                    "As I said, I met staff and parents and many parents have contacted me in relation to this. Under any measure, this school is going above and beyond. It is doing everything it can to provide an inclusive education for children. Staff are stretching themselves at every measure and they have been hit with this. It is devastating for the whole school community, for the principal and for the special education co-ordinator. It factors in additional SNA support and it looks at the potential and the opportunity to work with that and then it is given this news. To add insult to injury, after waiting more than two months, the school is given three days to appeal. That is simply not good enough. There needs to be greater connection and greater understanding in relation to this."

By the end of this year, there will be over 23,000 SNAs working in our education system, committed to supporting and nurturing children with special educational needs. The number of SNAs available for allocation has continued to increase annually, resulting in a significant increase in the number of SNAs employed by schools.

Each year, schools are advised of their SNA supports, which indicates the NCSE will undertake reviews to ensure SNAs are allocated to the children with the greatest level of need. Such reviews can see an increase or reduction in the level of support or no change in allocation. This has always been part of the work of the NCSE and is necessary in order to ensure resources are allocated in line with the level of need.",

The school has also requested the NCSE adviser support in the area of behaviour, on the recommendation of the NCSE’s special educational needs organiser, SENO. The NCSE has confirmed this support was provided to the school in October.

It should be the case that the NCSE, which is in the position of advising and co-ordinating the education provision for children with special educational needs, and any school can discuss these matters in an orderly fashion. I will take the matters the Deputy has raised and relay them to the Minister. As the Deputy mentioned, the school has requested an SNA review in recent days. That is very welcome.

The primary issue in Kildare was the lack of critical infrastructure, including social infrastructure, especially in the north of the county. During the housing crisis throughout the country, Kildare has taken a lot of the housing, particularly as a result of the pressures on Dublin. I welcome a lot of that housing. I am living in a house that was built in recent years. I welcome more housing in my constituency. We saw a 12.8% increase in the population of Kildare North between 2016 and 2022. I have no doubt the population has become a lot higher since then given the amount of housing that has been built. Despite this, we are struggling when it comes to core infrastructure.",

St. Patrick’s Primary School has been in prefabs since its inception and these structures are falling apart. St. Raphael’s Special School still has not got its new school building. Celbridge Community School is still in temporary accommodation as well.",

You would not get it in other parts of the country but for some reason Kildare needs to put up with it time and time again.",
                    "On childcare infrastructure, it is impossible for young parents to find a crèche. There is no primary care centre in Maynooth or in Leixlip even though both towns are bulging. There is no community centre in my home town of Maynooth. If a rural town had no community centre there would be uproar but we in the north east of Kildare in particular have to put up with it time and time again.",
                    "On playgrounds and recreational spaces, we have been promised a new playground in Maynooth. We have received a new playground in Kilcock, which is welcome, but it has been left in a terrible state since it was finished. Clane’s playground is outdated. An upgrade was pledged for the one in Celbridge by Kildare County Council but still has not been delivered. There is no public swimming pool in the north east of Kildare. There is no public swimming pool for families in Maynooth, Leixlip, Celbridge, Clane and throughout the north west of the county, even though there has been commitment after commitment. There are issues with energy and water, and outages of both, time and time again, as I have said.",
                    "If we are expecting communities to take on more housing, which Kildare has done for the past 20 years, we should be building the social infrastructure to match it. Children should be guaranteed a crèche to go to, a school to go to, a doctor to care for them when they are sick and gardaí to look out for the community when there are issues, but these things are not happening. Older people should have a general practitioner they can rely on, but we are not seeing it. My job as a newly elected TD is to ensure the best not only for the people of Kildare but also for the people of the country as a whole, as we all do. However, I suggest that because we are seen as a wealthy county we are not seeing the investment we should."

He earlier raised the issues with large-scale renewable energy projects so this very much follows from that.",
                    "As highlighted in the programme for Government, delivery of essential infrastructure is a key driver in ensuring our economy’s competitiveness and resilience. In the past five years more than €65 billion has been invested in capital infrastructure projects across the country to improve people’s lives, including through the national development plan. It is estimated that total capital investment in 2025 will be close to €17 billion by the end of the year. This represents the highest annual spend to date in the country and this level of investment is going to increase even further. The revised NDP published in July sets out over €275 billion in public capital investment out to 2035. It is the largest and most significant capital injection in our economy in the history of the State. The Government has prioritised investment towards critical growth-enabling sectors, mainly housing, energy, water and transport, in line with the ambitions in the review to enable the delivery of over 300,000 new homes and to boost our economic competitiveness.",
                    "As well as the core housing and competitive objectives, the Government recognises that the delivery of essential infrastructure is a key driver for enabling and fostering balanced regional development. The NDP investment aligns with the national planning framework, Ireland’s planning and spatial strategy, to form Project Ireland 2040, which is an overarching national strategy for social, economic and cultural development. Since Project Ireland 2040 was first launched in 2018, the Government has overseen the delivery of many impactful NDP projects across the country. This includes projects in Kildare North such as the widening of the M7 between Naas and Newbridge; the Sallins bypass; the Maynooth University technology, society and innovation building; a new 1,000-pupil post-primary school in Naas Community College; and Naas library. Numerous small projects have also been delivered or are planned for north Kildare in the housing, education and cultural sectors, including the delivery of hundreds of new housing units over recent years across towns such as Naas, Maynooth and Kilcock. The budget published in October lays out an Exchequer capital expenditure allocation of €19.1 billion, which is an increase of €2 billion on 2025, for increased infrastructure projects and programmes right across the country.",
                    "This includes investment in projects in north Kildare such as the development of student accommodation at Maynooth University; the protection and renewal of the heavy rail network and fleet renewal; the development of the DART+ programme; the progression of the Grand Canal greenway; investment in the eastern and midlands region water supply project; the progression of Uisce Éireann's Enfield to Kilcock trunk main project and Leixlip water treatment plant upgrade; and the development of smaller projects in north Kildare across sectors including schools, housing and cultural areas.",
                    "Further to the announcement of the 2026 capital priorities on budget day, Ministers will publish their sectoral capital plans this month. They will outline the projects to be prioritised for delivery over the next five years from the increased NDP investment, and will provide further detail to the Deputy on the capital programme and projects to be delivered right across the country, including in Kildare North."

The investments in Kildare North are primarily to accommodate new homes being built. My point is that investment is not being made in the social infrastructure that is required for the existing population, notwithstanding the future population. DART+ and improvements to water infrastructure are welcome but let us be real here. This is about allowing more homes to be built in Kildare. As I have said, I welcome new homes in Kildare. We need as many new homes as possible. However, what I am speaking about here is primary care centres, Garda stations and community centres. These are core elements if a society is to run properly. I have been contacted by families who cannot get a GP. There are new mums who cannot get a GP for themselves or for their children. There are serious issues in towns and villages in rural areas around Kildare but the call-out times for gardaí, through no fault of the Garda division in Kildare, are not good enough. I look at schools that are crumbling and housed in temporary accommodation. This is not good enough for the existing population, notwithstanding all these additional homes we are going to build in Kildare. We need those new homes. That is fine but if we want social cohesion and for people to live a good and normal life, we need to ensure they have the basic services they need and deserve."

As the Deputy has said, it is critically important that Kildare North features heavily in many of these plans. The Deputy mentioned Garda stations, primary care centres and community centres. We need developments with that type of orientation. It is critically important. The national planning framework has been published. I am sure extensive work has been done on commuter bands and on areas where there is a requirement for additional health services, schools and public amenities. I look forward to seeing these investment plans. It is really important that they are detailed and that they include reference to Kildare North in many sectors, including transport. As the Deputy said earlier, if large-scale developments are being built, that development should be transport-oriented and support public transport, including rail and roads. It is also important that these announcements are not just published in isolation but as part of a collective plan. As a Government, we are very focused on increasing capital development and accelerating delivery. It is important that, through the newly established infrastructure development unit, we see these projects not only being announced but being progressed through the planning and procurement stages and delivered at pace. It is incumbent on us all to continue to raise the level of ambition and to ensure that the revised national development plan, to which over €275 billion has been assigned out to 2035, is delivered in full right across the country."

                    "I raise an issue I dealt with when I was Minister of State at the Department of Health. It is about having an integrated homeless health hub in Cork city. In October 2024, I arranged a meeting between the Department of Health, the Department of housing, the HSE in Cork and Cork City Council. It was agreed that we would all work together to establish a day centre where people who were homeless could go. At the present time, there is accommodation available to these people at night. The vast majority avail of that accommodation although some do not. However, during the day, there is no place for anyone to go. The accident and emergency department at Mercy University Hospital is under severe pressure. People tend to use that. Businesses are also under pressure because people need someplace to go, particularly in wet or cold weather. We have identified a site, a building, but the building's owners are getting concerned that, 12 or 14 months on, there is still nothing signed on the dotted line in relation to this development. Even if it were signed in the morning, it would still take anything up to 12 months before the facility came on stream while 600 people still have no place to go during the day.",
                    "There is also a huge advantage from the HSE point of view. It is currently paying out over €2 million in staff costs but these staff are in different locations, providing a range of services to people who are homeless. If there was one hub for all of this work, it would make it far easier for the health service, the city council and all of the support people within social services. This issue really needs to be prioritised. I certainly do not want further delay. There is another risk. There is a property identified in a very good location. It is important that we step up to the mark and progress the project now and that I am not back here again in 12 months' time making the same plea.",
                    "I know the Department of Health is not the Minister of State's area but I ask that this be brought to the attention of all of the Ministers. We need to prioritise this issue. We also need to take the pressure off Mercy University Hospital. It is providing an excellent service but it is restricted in the support it can give people who are homeless who are not necessarily looking for medical care but who need someplace to go. We really need to prioritise this project now. Cork is the second biggest city in the country. It is amazing that we do not have such a health hub in the city available for people who are homeless during the day. Obviously, our priority is to reduce the number of people who are homeless. This hub can help with that as well. It can help people to access housing that is suitable for them. At the moment, people who are homeless feel there is no one supporting them. They feel that they are on their own and that there is no dedicated service available to them. I ask that this now be given priority and that it not be delayed further."

This hub will provide a service centred around the basic needs of the clients presenting, but with a focus on homelessness, housing and migration, and it will be aligned with health. The provision of the service shall reduce the need for emergency department presentations. The integrated inclusion health hub would centralise all services for people who are homeless in one location, remove barriers and increase accessibility and engagement with healthcare services.

We already have the staff in place so no additional staff will be required. The issue is about providing the funding for work to be done on the building to make sure it is adequate for the services that will be provided there. It is important the Department makes sure the HSE, the city council and the Department of housing deliver this within the next three to four months, which means prioritising the funding and then prioritising getting the work done. Quite a bit of work needs to be done on the premises but it could be delivered within a short enough period provided we make the decision now and not in six, nine or 12 months.

There is currently a residential waiting list for 55 individuals: eight are aged 66 and over, 22 are aged 46 to 65, 15 are aged 31 to 45 and ten are aged 18 to 30. Forty of these individuals are classified as high risk, highlighting the urgent need for placements and increased resources to provide care for them. Unfortunately, due to resource constraints, St. Michael's House placed a pause on new additions to the residential waiting list from 14 March this year.",
                    "An issue facing families across the country and my constituency concerns children who are now adults and who have disabilities. Their families are deeply concerned about what will happen when the parents pass away. Who will care for their children? There are also those who do not have the capacity to provide care for their children any more because they have got too old or the needs have increased to the point that it is not sustainable for them to continue to provide care in the home. As I have outlined, there are significant waiting lists.",
                    "I have been contacted by the parents of a woman - their youngest child - who is 32 years of age.",
                    "She has Down’s syndrome and associated medical and health issues. As well as Down’s syndrome, she has a visual impairment, mobility and balance issues, sleep apnoea, for which she uses a machine, and speech and language difficulties. She attends a St. Michael’s House day service from 9.30 a.m. to 3 p.m. She really enjoys going and participating in the various activities but there are no respite or social supports outside of this for her parents, who are now in their 70s. They are physically, emotionally and mentally exhausted. Their enduring worry is what will happen to her when they die. There are no residential places available for her. The Minister of State can think about that emotional and mental exhaustion of parents in that situation, who are concerned about what will happen to their child when they pass on. Where will she be minded? Who will look after her?",
                    "Services like St. Michael’s House are struggling to keep up with demand for respite and residential care, which is leaving families in unimaginable and unsustainable situations as they worry about what will happen to their adult children. Between hospital staffing costs, operation costs and, crucially, the lack of multi-annual funding, they are projecting a funding deficit for 2025. If the Minister of State can give me a response to these questions, I would appreciate it."

All Deputies across the House will have specific cases relating to the many families who are finding challenges in this regard. There has been significant investment in residential services throughout the tenure of this Government. We are very aware of the need for increased service provision within the disability sector. In acknowledgement of this, the programme for Government commits to tackling waiting lists for specialist disability services by progressively implementing the action plan for disability services out to 2026 and resourcing and delivering on its targets.",
                    "In budget 2026, the Government has allocated a record €3.8 billion to disability services, reflecting our commitment to the expansion of services to meet the needs of people with disabilities. This represents an increase of almost 20% year on year and an overall increase of €1.8 billion since 2020. Approximately €2.21 billion of the funding secured will enable the Department to deliver residential services for over 9,000 disabled people, enabling them to live as independently as possible in their local communities. In 2026, this means continued support for people currently accessing residential services and an additional €65 million to support the delivery of additional residential responses and supports for adults and children with disabilities. Residential service delivery expectations will be confirmed in the coming weeks in the forthcoming HSE national service plan for 2026.",
                    "The Deputy raised a specific case in St. Michael's House. It is a pivotal provider of disability support, particularly much-needed residential supports. I am informed by the HSE that the organisation provides residential supports to 410 adults and a small number of children with disabilities across 79 centres, mostly in Dublin and the wider Leinster area. It is the intention of this Government to continue to support organisations such as St. Michael's House to provide specialist disability supports to those who require them and to continue to support people with disabilities to live meaningful and fulfilling lives, with a person-centred approach across all services provided.",
                    "The Deputy will be aware that the significant demand for specialist disability services across all regional health areas nationally exceeds what can currently be provided. This is reflective of the additional 20% budget that has been provided. While the Department is working alongside the HSE to move towards more planned provision in residential services, the nature and level of demand is such that the placements delivered tend to be in response to shorter term priority needs. It is important to recognise that the HSE faces significant challenges with regard to increasing the provision of residential placements, namely, the availability of suitable housing, staffing, the increasing cost of providing residential care, the changing needs of service users and regulation.",
                    "In order to address these challenges, the Department of Children, Disability and Equality continues to engage with the Department of housing, as well as the HSE, to explore various ways of responding to demand to provide suitable living solutions that give people with disabilities greater independence and choice in their daily lives."

He acknowledged that the HSE is facing significant challenges in the provision of residential placements and in the availability of suitable housing and staffing, as well as the increasing costs of providing residential care and the changing needs of service users. He has outlined the challenge, but we need to see solutions. While there is an increase in funding, it is clearly not enough and that is the issue. What about families like the one in the case I raised, where the parents of a child of 32 years of age with Down’s syndrome, who are in their 70s, are absolutely terrified about her future and where she will go? We have a significant waiting list for people, eight of them, as I said, over 66 years, and 22 aged between 46 and 65 years. These are high-risk situations. We need a much more considered and significant funding response that addresses these challenges. We cannot just let them go on. People who have disabilities have every right to a decent standard of living, an independent life and supported housing and to be able to live a quality life like anybody else, but as disabled people explain over and over, along with their carers and families, that is not the situation. Yes, the Government is dealing with and responding to decades and decades - indeed, since the foundation of the State - of inadequate support for people with disabilities, but we have to get it right now. We have to provide that republic of equality, particularly for disabled people. We need extra effort for cases like these and services like St. Michael’s House to ensure people with disabilities have that quality of life, and so their families do too. I ask the Government to do more on that."

That is why we have a dedicated Minister of State with responsibility for disability at the Cabinet, working within the Department of Children, Disability and Equality, as part of the wider Government response to increase the number of residential places and improve capacity within the sector as a whole. The action plan for disability services out to 2026 is designed to provide additional funding but also to help build capacity within the services and meet the future needs around residential placements through the provision of over 900 residential care places to tackle not just the current need but also the unmet need, and also to ensure that supply keeps pace with demand because while one bed may be filled this week, another bed may be required next week.",
                    "We have seen progress in 2024. Last year, over 220 new additional residential places were delivered. As of August this year, we had over 142 new residential places. In the most recent budget, an allocation of over €65 million in additional funding was secured for additional disability residential responses. That will be set out in the HSE’s national service plan for 2026. We want to continue to support the likes of St. Michael’s House. Over 1,200 services are being funded by HSE Dublin north county and Dublin city and west, including many in the Deputy’s constituency. I assure him that the Department is working alongside service providers such as St. Michael’s House and the HSE to address these challenges and to support providers right across the country to carry out the vital work they do in the delivery of services to those with a disability."

                "We gather here in the Dáil this evening to debate a very simple Bill that would add just one word to the law of the land, to include comedy in the definition of arts in the Arts Act 2003. We are having this debate at the culmination of a long struggle by comedians for recognition and for Arts Council support in particular. I welcome Ailish McCarthy, who has led the fight for three years now, gathering thousands of signatures on a petition that supports the intention of this Bill. She has also gained the support of numerous arts organisations. Ailish should have been spending her time creating for her comedy sketches and for all of her life as a comedian, rather than having to divert away from that creative work to bang down the doors of the Arts Council, the Minister, politicians and us who are gathered here, to demand equality for one of Ireland's arts. At the same time, she is also trying to keep comedians aware of the resourcing opportunities that exist through her Irish comedy guide. She does that out of the goodness of her heart and an understanding of how difficult it is for comedians and to harness an awareness among comedians and their supports of the need for supports for comedy in Ireland. She is a champion of her art and, on behalf of TDs across the Dáil, I would like to take this opportunity to commend her on her work. Gabhaim buíochas le Ailish McCarthy as a cuid oibre go dtí seo. Níor chóir go mbeadh sí ag tabhairt faoin obair ná go gcuirfí an t-ualach breise sin uirthi ag feachtasaíocht anuas ar an obair atá sí ag déanamh i réimse an ghrinn ag cothú coiméide agus gáire ionann, mar tá an fhéith sin inti. Tá aitheantas ag dul di as sin.",
                "I would also like to welcome other comedians who joined us earlier in an audiovisual room presentation, some of whom are looking in on Oireachtas TV and elsewhere. We had a very interesting briefing this morning for TDs and Senators with a number of comedians and those who are supporting the campaign, including Ciaran McMahon, Sinéad Crilly, Anthony Ferns and Richard Cook, who have all been strong advocates for comedy. Richard Cook founded the Cat Laughs festival in Kilkenny, which marks its 30th anniversary this year. There are many other festivals around the country as well as weekly, monthly and impromptu comedy nights across the country, which deserve to be supported.",
                "The purpose of today's Second Stage debate on Sinn Féin's Arts (Recognition of Comedy) (Amendment) Bill is to decide on the general principle that comedy should be recognised as art. Thankfully, in some ways the debate is already won, in the minds of most politicians and in the hearts of the public. We received expressions of support from TDs and Senators from all parties today, from Fine Gael, Sinn Féin, the Labour Party, the Social Democrats and the Seanad Independent Group, at that meeting. They are in favour of giving comedians the recognition and support they deserve. Nobody from the Government or the Opposition thus far has expressed any opposition to the Bill, which is a good sign. It is not a party-political issue. I hope we are not going to divide on it. We might divide on the approach to it later on, but not on the intent of the Bill. The Minister for culture, Deputy Patrick O'Donovan, has gone public and expressed the view on RTÉ that the Arts Council should fund comedy as an art form. In some ways it is down to the Arts Council, but thus far it has not been willing or encouraging of the Bill. I welcome the Minister's words.",
                "The proposal to delay the Bill by 18 months in its legislative journey is very strange given the expression of support. The last time the Minister and I were having a spat here in the Dáil, he asked me what I had against Listowel. What has he got against comedians? We will have that spat another time; he still has time to change his mind because this can progress to Committee Stage. Deputy Ciarán Ahern has proposed a delay of a month. That would be logical. When we vote on this in two weeks' time, that would put it up to Christmas. The committee would not receive the Bill until January at the earliest. The Brennan report on the Arts Council will have been published and digested at that stage, so the Minister would not have the excuse of having to wait for any reports. We would be able to progress this Bill to the pre-legislative scrutiny phase and deal with the outcome of that report. I hope this evening's debate will change his mind and that the Minister of State, Deputy Dillon, will withdraw or at least not move the amendment to delay this. The delay is costing people money. At the end of the day, these are comedians who do not get the recognition they deserve and definitely do not get the funding and income they deserve for keeping us all happy in the way we should be.",
                "There is no doubt that comedy is an art. Section 2 of the Arts Act 2003 defines the arts as \"any creative or interpretative expression (whether traditional or contemporary) in whatever form, and includes, in particular, visual arts, theatre, literature, music, dance, opera, film, circus and architecture, and includes any medium when used for those purposes\".",
                "Comedy is not mentioned but nor are others. There is nothing exclusionary. The intention of the Bill, because they have been discriminated against, is just to insert that into the legislation so that there is no doubt. Ailish McCarthy wrote to all TDs in recent times and set out the case a lot more eloquently than I probably did. In one paragraph, she says:",
                "Comedy is an integral part of Ireland's cultural identity. It has entertained, challenged and reflected our society while contributing significantly to the nighttime economy. Irish comedians have built a strong global reputation enhancing Ireland's image abroad while providing a thriving industry at home yet despite its cultural and economic impact comedy remains excluded from the same supports available to other art forms. This is why we need your support to progress this bill to the next stage.",
                "The Bill needs to continue. It is not going to change the approach of the Arts Council overnight but it would if it became law within the next couple of months or a little bit further on if needs be. At least we would have thrashed out the impact of the change we are talking about.",
                "We are trying to ensure that the Arts Council, which has a substantial amount of funding, shares that among all of the art forms. Thus far it has not been sharing that for the benefit of comedians in Ireland. We need to ensure that comedians have access to that funding - not a guarantee but access. They need access to apply for grants from which they have been excluded and access to apply for the supports that they deserve as an art form. That is the intent of the Bill but it is also the consequence of it because then comedians will be mentioned in law. Ailish McCarthy managed to get the support of a number of arts organisations and those who are supportive of, in some ways, the gig economy. She listed many of them: Safe Gigs Ireland, Aiken Promotions, Arts and Disability Ireland, Funny Women, Irish Street Arts, Circus and Spectacle Network, Give Us the Night, Disabled Artists and Disabled Academics, Youth Theatre Ireland, the Irish Theatre Institute, the Irish Comedy Guide, the Live Comedy Association, the British Comedy Guide, Gorm Media, the Irish Film Institute, Safe to Create and the Performing Arts Forum. Irish Equity, which represents actors and performers, has stressed that art is made by the labour of creative people and there is no doubt there is a great deal of labour involved in crafting a stand-up routine or a sketch or preparing an improv comedy. These take skills and require time and dedication to write, rehearse and perform. Learning and teaching are required to develop the skills involved in this art.",
                "Comedy is not a new art. Not alone did the Ancient Greeks consider drama to consist of both comedy and tragedy, but stand-up was present too in the Roman world. A wonderful story in Mary Beard's SPQR: A History of Ancient Rome details how a comic dealt with a hostile audience. The comedian who was on stage before him was killed for a joke that did not go down well in 91 BC. I am not suggesting we go back to those days but at least there is an understanding that comedy has a long history and is well respected. \"So spare the swallow, which the gods allow to nest safely in all your houses”, said the ancient comedian, and today we in the Dáil say it. It is time to nurture the swallows of tomorrow. We do not have to look beyond these shores, however, to see the rich history of comedy as an art form. In Gaelic Ireland, the comedic art of satire was considered the most powerful weapon of a poet, capable of toppling a person's reputation, status and kinship and was even suspected of causing a person physical harm, as Dr. Gordon Ó Riain outlined to RTÉ Brainstorm earlier this year. I hope the Dáil will accede to the request that this Bill be passed and go to Committee Stage to continue its legislative journey without any delay. Go raibh maith agaibh."

                "\"Dáil Éireann resolves that the Arts (Recognition of Comedy) (Amendment) Bill 2024 be deemed to be read a second time this day eighteen months, on the grounds that this amendment is premature as the Minister proposes to await the report of the Expert Advisory Committee on the Arts Council before giving consideration to what legislative changes to the Arts Act 2003 would be appropriate.\".",
                "I thank Deputy Ó Snodaigh for his opening comments. The Minister for Culture, Communications and Sport, Deputy Patrick O'Donovan, is unavailable, unfortunately, to be here this evening due to prior commitments and sends his apologies. He has asked me to step in in his absence.",
                "The Government continues its support for the arts and culture and places great value on culture and the arts sector. In the programme for Government, we recognise that they are essential to a well-rounded society, providing opportunity for education, expression and community engagement. The arts and culture programme of the Minister's Department aims to support the development of the arts, culture and creativity by individuals and communities. The provision of over €384 million in budget 2026 for the arts and culture programme will maintain and increase funding right across a range of key initiatives. In particular, the Minister will bring a successor scheme for the basic income for the arts pilot to Government with the intention of embedding a permanent basic income in the arts and culture sector. Support also continues in 2026 for the national cultural institutions, Culture Ireland and Creative Ireland. Screen Ireland's funding has also been increased to support its work in making Ireland a competitive destination for Screen Ireland production.",
                "Regarding the Arts Council, in budget 2026, the Minister maintained record funding for the council. This is in the context of funding for the Arts Council having increased by over 130% since 2015. However, the Minister wants to await the outcome of the ongoing external review before considering further increasing the Arts Council's budget. As the Deputies will be aware, the Arts Council 2023 annual report and financial statements were submitted to Government last February with a report on the unsuccessful IT project at the council. This project, which failed to deliver - at a cost of €6.675 million - has given rise to fundamental questions about governance within the Arts Council. While the report on the ICT project clearly sets out the background to the project, it also points to a broader range of more fundamental questions about governance and culture within the Arts Council. Accordingly, the Minister subsequently set up an external review of the governance and the organisational culture in the Arts Council to Government. He appointed three experts with a strong background in governance of large and complex organisations to the committee, namely, Professor Niamh Brennan, who is the chair, and Dr. Margaret Cullen and Mr. John McCarthy. The Minister is grateful for their efforts in undertaking this critical task and looks forward to receiving their recommendations. He has also been clear about the failures that must be addressed to safeguard public funding and prevent a recurrence of issues that have arisen. This review is essential in addressing failings within the Arts Council and to put it on a solid footing for the future so that it can continue to perform the very valuable role in supporting and developing Irish arts and culture.",
                "Alongside the review, the Arts Council has continued its day-to-day work in supporting Irish artists during the review process, and the Minister is very clear that artists will not suffer due to the failings of the council. To restore trust and confidence in the Arts Council, its corporate governance framework must be fit for purpose to support the delivery of its statutory responsibilities. Assurance is required that the culture of the Arts Council, at all levels, is open, transparent and engaged with all stakeholders both internal and external and in a manner that is appropriate to its statutory remit to deliver the arts.",
                "As the Minister has said previously at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Arts, Media, Communications, Culture and Sport, once the review of the governance of culture in the Arts Council is concluded, it is his intention to examine how the activities of the Arts Council can be widened to support more art forms. He has made it clear, and he will continue to do so, that he wants to see a more inclusive approach adopted by the Arts Council and a wider range of art forms funded and supported, with no form excluded from support, including comedy. He intends to enable the Arts Council to modernise and adapt to both the cultural and artistic needs of Ireland going forward. To commence this process, the Minister has asked his officials to engage with the Arts Council to begin consideration on how it will widen the range of art forms it supports.",
                "While the Minister, Deputy O'Donovan, agrees with the intent of Deputy Ó Snodaigh's Bill, he believes that it is best to address this as part of the broader reform of the Arts Council. Accordingly, he intends to await the report from the expert advisory committee on the Arts Council, which is due for completion in the coming weeks. Given the scale of the failings within the Arts Council, it is vital that the response is not only comprehensive but also far-reaching and underpinned by transparent and rigorous analysis. The Minister will then consider how best to progress the report's recommendations, including making any appropriate amendments to the Arts Act 2003. For this reason, the Minister, Deputy O'Donovan, believes it is prudent to defer further consideration until the outcome of the review from the expert advisory committee. To facilitate that, the Government has agreed that a timed amendment of 18 months to this Bill is necessary.",
                "Again, on my behalf and that of the Minister, Deputy O'Donovan, I thank Deputy Ó Snodaigh for his interest in this matter. The Minister looks forward to working with him on a broader package of reforms for the Arts Council in due course."

They are really important when it comes to keeping venues, particularly smaller ones, open.",
                "Irish wit and humour is well known across the globe. I heard one Irish comedian say that performing in Ireland is harder than anywhere else because everybody in the room thinks they should be on the stage. I was really surprised to see that stand-up, sketch and improv comedians cannot apply to the Arts Council for bursaries that are open to other performers, especially when it is considered that our small island punches so far above its weight when it comes to producing well-known comedians who are so successful on the international stage. This Bill will ensure that comedy will get its own specific funding scheme. It will not be lumped in with everything else. I have heard from performers that this is important in making them feel valued and making them feel that their art form matters. Most importantly, it is keeping those comedians here in Ireland and not losing them to places like England, Scotland, Canada and New Zealand, all places where comedy is a registered art form.",
                "Some have raised questions as to whether there is an element of snobbery behind why comedians are not included. I suppose that stems from the fact that comedy is a very accessible form of art that can be put on in small venues in nearly every community across this State. However, instead of that being a reason to look down on it, it is even more of a reason we should support it.",
                "I am disappointed to see that the Government says it will delay this Bill for 18 months and I am not clear on its reasoning. The Government points to the review of the Arts Council but that is totally unrelated to this Bill. I ask the Government to drop its plans to delay this Bill, allow it to progress to Committee Stage and let us recognise comedy as a living, breathing form of art that is valued and supported here in Ireland."

Irish culture is much revered around the globe, from our music, our poetry and our plays to our dance. Our culture is synonymous with our identity as Irish people both at home and abroad. Our old rebel songs give us insight into our past, honouring those who came before us, ag troid ar son saoirse na hÉireann. Our poets and playwrights are well renowned, and works by Beckett, Joyce and many others are still performed to much delight to this day across the world. The Feis competition of Irish dancing is as competitive as ever, with young boys and girls competing every year. These are what might be considered the traditional arts that Ireland is well known for globally, what is typically plastered on the walls of Irish bars in Tokyo, Washington, Berlin and Sydney, fud far na cruinne.

It is part of the fabric of who we are as a people - storytelling, talking, caint, scéalta a insint. We are born storytellers and entertainers, yet our craic is completely unrecognised by the Government. I know people might not necessarily describe what happens within these walls as much craic at all but it is important we recognise those who are good craic, including the many incredible stand-up comedians who have graced the Moate Theatre in Naas. I was there recently with a few of my friends. We saw Jarlath Regan from Kildare and we had a great night with plenty of laughs.",

Currently, the Arts Council can fund art forms that are not mentioned in the Arts Act but it explicitly prohibits stand-up, sketch and improv, and I really do not know why. This Bill can fix that. This prohibition means that comedians cannot apply for bursaries while their counterparts in theatre acting, for example, can. Festivals funded by the Arts Council may platform comedians but there are no direct supports provided for them.",

This is a matter of dignity and respect for our comedians, who, to be clear, absolutely are artists and are loved and valued by the public here and the world over, yet somehow are not recognised as artists for the purpose of receiving any State support. It really amazed me to learn that comedy is not recognised as an art form. I think most people would assume it is. The definition of art in the existing Arts Act, as Deputy Ó Snodaigh pointed out, refers to \"any creative or interpretive expression\" and includes visual arts, theatre, literature, music, dance, opera, film, circus and architecture. It seems like a really broad definition, and I just cannot understand how the Arts Council does not see comedy as falling within that. I have heard that the supposed reasoning for this is that comedy is some sort of commercial art form. That in itself is, ironically, a joke. Every artist and every art form ultimately aspires to be commercially viable. We have some commercially successful comedians, yes, but there are plenty who are not.",

It is a fundamentally silly and illogical approach.",
                "This Bill is very close to my heart, as some of my best friends are comedians. I dabbled in a little bit of comedy previously. I am proud that I am good friends with the guys in the sketch comedy group, Foil Arms and Hog, who are one of the outstanding comedic acts in this country and one of our most successful now. However, I knew them when they were younger and not successful and they were just foil arms and piglet; I apologise for that. We did some writing and acting together as part of a Father Ted play that we put on when we were all in the drama society in UCD quite a long time ago now. I even did some sketch writing with them after that and we almost went to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival together, but it did not happen at the time. They kept writing. They founded Foil Arms and Hog. They would not admit this to themselves, but we are under Dáil privilege here now, so what are they going to do? I was obviously the most talented and best looking of the group - the fifth Beatle, if you will - but they Pete Bested me. They ditched me and moved on to bigger and better things. I am fine; I am over it. I certainly am not going to hold it against every comedian in the country - at least not anymore. I went on to share a flat with Seán Flanagan from Foil Arms and Hog for many years when they were starting out. I owe Seán a lot when it comes to him sticking his neck out on the line for my political career and doing some brilliant videos with me during my election campaigns. He is one of my oldest and dearest friends and I have shared the ups and downs of his comedy career with him.",
                "Irish stand-up comedy is not an easy environment to get a foothold in, let alone make money from. There are numerous small venues and comedy nights around Dublin, like in the International Bar, where comedians can get a start, but I have seen first-hand what a difficult lifestyle it is. We all know that many comedians need to go on the dole to maintain themselves. The fees for appearing at a comedy night like that are absolutely paltry. I saw when Foil Arms and Hog were starting out that they were splitting these fees in three between them. From living with someone at the start of their comedy career, I have seen the sacrifice, diligence and dedication that is required, the long and antisocial hours, the poor personal hygiene and the inability to wash dishes or carry out routine household chores, but it was all done for the sake of their art, which is their passion, or was it? It is not art, according to the State. Aside from the monetary aspect to this, how insulting and disheartening must it be to know that the State does not recognise what you are pouring their heart and soul into as art? It is not good enough for the Minister to kick the can down the road on this for 18 months for the sake of a one-word amendment. I thought this Government wanted to be one of implementation and action. Here is a good chance. There is no monetary ask here. This Bill is simply seeking that another form of art would be recognised for the purposes of applying for existing grants and funding. It is a simple but effective Bill. It is a one-word change to an Act, but one which could make a huge difference to our comedic acts. I commend it to the House."

As Deputy Ahern has just done, I wish to outline my own comedy connections and why I feel such a connection with this legislation. One of the most important people in my life is Des Bishop. He is my cousin. He is somebody who I am very close with, and he has been a big part of my life and particularly my daughter's life since she was born 25 years ago. He calls me the sister he never had. I cannot quite say the same because I have a brother, but we are very close. Like Deputy Ahern, I have seen Des's career grow from when he was only 19 years old. He started in comedy in UCC with his brother, Aidan. The two of them found their way through comedy as a career and all of the challenges that it brings. As somebody with a lot of family and friends in the performance space and arts space more broadly, I also see the stark difference between those people who find success in arts and those who do not.",
                "Everybody who engages in arts, including comedy, dance, theatre and visual arts, do it for passion. They do it because they are compelled to do it. In my experience, they genuinely have no choice but to do it. Comedy, in particular, puts people in situations where they have to dig deep and bear a lot of hardship to try to get to the point where they can break even and can actually build a viable career in this space. Yet, it is so important because it brings so much to us. Even today by having a little bit of a laugh in discussing this, it lightened the mood. It has made the whole debate a lot more enjoyable and probably more meaningful for anybody involved in it or watching. Laughter brings us together as humans and comedy creates laughter. However, comedy also prompts us to think. It prompts self-awareness in us. It promotes social causes, and Des in particular has championed that throughout his career, particularly in what he done around, for example, way back in one of his first television series where he looked at minimum wage jobs and then on towards learning languages, as he did with both Irish and Chinese and what that meant for his life. There is much power in comedy and what it gives to society and culture. This is something we have to nurture and cherish.",
                "The impact that this lack of recognition has had on the comedy scene is quite stark because as things stand, everyone across the arts space endures the lack of support for artists in this country. It is what has pushed artists of all types abroad. London has become essentially an easier home for Irish comedians than Dublin. We see from their success just how much talent we have in this arena. It is a huge loss to our cultural scene and to our society that people have no choice but to practice their craft elsewhere. The Bill presents an opportunity to give comedy the recognition, and as others have said, the dignity and respect that it genuinely deserves as an art form. It levels the playing field in ensuring that people in comedy can access arts funding and that funding can help foster new talent, writing workshops, residencies and mentorships. People will have the chance to pursue a sustainable career, if they so wish, and to be supported in sharing comedy with as many people as possible. It would be an incredibly positive and easy move to take. There is already an argument that comedy should be eligible for this funding as one of the arts. The Bill would bring comedians certainty in the area and grant them the same respect afforded to their fellow artists.",
                "I add my disappointment with the Minister's amendment to delay this Bill by 18 months because artists cannot wait for support. Just like we have seen this gap emerge between the end of the basic income pilot scheme and the beginning of the new scheme that we hope will introduced next year, to many it may not seem like a long time, but the reality for artists is that they cannot afford to wait. People have to make decisions about jobs and bills. It is often those pressures that simply make or break comedians and other artists. It should never be the financial pressure of the industry that decides whether art gets made and which artists get to make it, comedy included. An 18-month delay means 18 months where people decide they cannot make comedy, that they must emigrate or that their craft is not worth pursuing. It is 18 months where we will continue to haemorrhage that talent. For that reason, I welcome Deputy Ahern's amendment. It is much more reasonable in recognising that there may need to be a few weeks for the Government to get its act together, but I do not see that it needs to be any longer than that."

In the arts Act, the guiding definition of the Arts Council states arts are creative, interpretive expressions in whatever form. However, for some reason I cannot fathom, it seems there is a wide cohort of disciplines that do not fit this definition and therefore are not eligible for funding. How anybody can say comedy falls outside this definition is beyond me. For a comedian to get up on stage in front of a live audience, it is as difficult a profession as it is a wonderful art form. They should have the same opportunity to access funding. Instead, the sector is woefully underfunded. I have met comedians living on couches, performing in venues that are decrepit and not fit for purpose, having to leave the country to further their art - I note the word \"art\" - or even worse, having to give it up altogether to get another job.",

I am based in Arklow and there are 14,000 people there but they have no entertainment venue. They have to drive 11 miles down the road to put on a show. I am asking that we totally review the whole funding of arts and ensure there is a level playing field. If there was ever a better example, it is the fact we are not funding our comedians."

                "Míle buíochas le Aengus Ó Snodaigh as an gcuireadh inniu. Bhí sé an-tábhachtach dom labhairt leis na daoine seo ar fad inniu chun scéalta a gcuid saolta a chloisteáil agus na trioblóidí atá siad ag dul tríd faoi láthair. Tá sé an-deacair do na daoine seo mar níl aon support ann dóibh. I thank every Deputy who spoke today. Many Deputies spoke about the loss of talent, talent being drained from this country with regard to the arts and comedy. My cousin, Amy Walsh, emigrated to Canada due to not being able to get this funding. She would love to be in Ireland, creating in our daytime and night-time economy, and adding to our economy by creating these nights that are very important to Irish society.",
                "The programme for Government, which I signed up to, believes that culture and art are essential for a well-rounded society. I do not understand how comedians are left out of this. This is not a joke to them, no pun intended. This is about the livelihoods of these comedians. I held a comedy night as I was a comedian before I got involved in politics. We had a fundraising event, raising money for Ukraine, and multiple comedians came along without any payment. They knew it was for a good cause but this is a constant for them. I spoke to them and they generally do not get paid for these acts. They are shining a light into people's lives for those 20 minutes. I was more afraid speaking on a comedy stage than speaking in this House, which is very funny. I am afraid I would give Deputy Ahern a run for his money, going head-to-head in a comedy act. It is something that needs to be said.",
                "I spoke to the comedians, Craig Moran, Rob Nother and Emman Idama, today. They are all constantly working and when the recent announcement to extend the scheme for artists was announced, it did crush them because it was not only comedians, but other artists, who were expecting to reapply to see if they could get into this scheme. When the Minister looks at extending the scheme again, he needs to look at what people are doing for the money they are getting because some people are not doing enough. These comedians are dying to get that funding.",
                "Regarding the basic income for artists, in the programme for Government we said we were going to assess it and pilot it to the max. I ask the Minister to look at that. I want to say to all the comedians in the Gallery today that they have my full support. By postponing this by 18 months, the Minister is just kicking the can down the road. The programme for Government states that we are going to assess this. I hope we can review this and support Deputy Ó Snodaigh's Bill."

                "I thank all the Deputies for their very informative contributions and the obvious passion they have towards this subject. It is great to hear some people's passion not just for the sector itself, but through having past experience in it. It is incumbent on us all to recognise the world-class arts sector we have, both amateur and professional. That is recognised internationally and domestically. It is the ambition of the Government and the Minister, Deputy O'Donovan, that it continues into the future and is supported. I am aware that over the lifetime of this Government the Minister wants to support the sector and, as previously stated in relation to this Private Members' Bill, he has sought and received Government approval on the timed amendment on the basis that he is awaiting the outcome of the review of the expert advisory committee. That is sensible given the considerations and legislative changes that will be required within the arts Act. That would only be appropriate in the context of what we are discussing today.",
                "The Minister has made it clear, and from listening to the many contributions today, we do want to see a more inclusive approach adopted by the Arts Council. Deputy Brennan talked about that and about other sectors also being included, namely, country music, amateur dramatics and comedy. We have many wide forms of arts here that have been excluded and that are not funded or supported. We need to look at this holistically in that regard. I know the Minster believes that is best addressed in the broader reform of the Arts Council and, as I said, on receipt of that report of the expert advisory committee, which is due for completion very soon.",
                "From speaking to the Minister, I know he then wants to consider how best to progress the report's recommendations. I am sure the Opposition will accuse us of moving too quickly, and not taking time to address that and make the appropriate amendments to the Arts Act 2003. I will ensure that the Minister is made aware of all of the contributions from Deputies."

                "I will address the last point first. There is absolutely nothing in the Bill that requires a delay. The Minister has the Brennan report from the Arts Council. It will appear and require a study and perhaps legislation. There is no reason this Bill and the other cannot progress when needs be. There is nothing stopping us from having two arts Bills in the same Dáil term. This is quite simple. A delay is a joke, but it is a bad joke.",
                "How do we get to a point where the vital role of comedy, which was recognised in Brehon law, is not only left out of legislation but is actively excluded from funding by our Arts Council? There is a real implication to being left out of the Arts Act. By denying comedians recognition as artists, we deny them support. The Ministe's decision to try to delay this for another year and a half is a slap in the face. As I said, there is no reason for it.",
                "The Arts Council is already obliged under section 9 of the Arts Act to promote knowledge, appreciation and practice of the arts and assist in improving standards in the arts, but because it does not consider comedy as art, it therefore refuses to do so. Where it provides scholarships, bursaries, residencies and mentorships to other artists, it does not provide that for comedians. The Arts Council is not required to exclude comedy. The Department of culture, under the previous Minister, Catherine Martin, made it clear that stand-up, sketch and improv could be considered part of a recognised art form of theatre. The Arts Council chose to continue to discriminate. That is shameful and that is why I introduced the Bill. There is no need for it, but because the Arts Council, in its current format, will not recognise that, it needs to be dealt with through legislation.",
                "Deputy Brennan made the point that other arts forms, such as country and western music, amateur drama, musical theatre and Irish dancing, fall under the Arts Act because it specifically names drama, music and so on. It is discrimination by the Arts Council in all of those forms. In this case, because it is not mentioned the council is able to claim that it will not fund it in any way.",
                "The Arts Council is failing in its duty under section 9. The Minister should withdraw or not pursue his delaying tactic. At the very least, he should adopt, on Wednesday week, Deputy Ahern's amendment. It would allow the Minister to delay this for a month which, in effect, delays it until the end of January. Even then, it would go to committee and the committee would decide. The Government has a majority on the committee and, therefore, can delay it even further. The Bill will not even reach Committee Stage. At least that would allow us to continue the debate in committee and allow those who are affected a platform to explain how it has affected them. It would allow the Arts Council a platform to explain why it took the decision it did. It would also allow the Minister a platform to explain why, if he believes at that stage there is a need for a further delay, that is his approach.",
                "The Arts Council continues to refuse to consider comedians as artists worthy of support. The wider legacy of snobbery that sees classical music but not country and western supported, funds opera but not musical theatre and excludes fashion design and storytelling as well as comedy needs to be addressed. That is a point we have heard. The Arts Council has to address that. If the arts committee needs to bring the council before it on matters other than IT supports and deal with the recognition of arts, that is something we should do. We should not have to discuss legislation to effect that.",
                "Comedian Sinead Crilly put it very powerfully earlier when she spoke to TDs and Senators. She said it feels like there simply is not money for people doing arts more for the working class. The same snobbery was on show the first time comedy was ever discussed the Dáil. Seamus Aloysius Burke said in 1924 he was very much afraid that public libraries would exhibit such things as musical comedy. We are still in the same space as were over 100 years ago. It would be a crying shame if, 100 years on, Fine Gael - the party that Deputy represented - provided the same reason for comedy to be excluded.",
                "I mentioned Richard Cook, who outlined the irony that the Arts Council funds venues and festivals that rely on comedy to fill seats in order to pay bills and develop audiences, yet it does not recognise comedy and closes its doors to comedians. He also challenged us to resist the hangover of old British colonial class-based ideas of art, where tragedy on stage was seen as noble but comedy rooted in the working class was seen as somewhat lesser. Other former colonies have gotten over this legacy. Canada, Australia and New Zealand are inclusive in their funding of the arts. Scotland has done the same. We have lagged behind. That is not policy. We need a policy of cultural decolonisation and that can be supported by accepting the Bill.",
                "It is about deciding for ourselves what art means in our own voices and on our own terms. Our culture has always integrated laughter and intellect. It is built into the DNA of how we communicate, from Swift to Wilde, Beckett to Dave Allen, Deirdre O'Kane, Dylan Moran, Dara Ó Briain, David O'Doherty, Alison Spittle to Joanne McNally and Tommy Tiernan. Our best comic artists have always used humour to express insight, understanding and truth. We come from a storytelling culture, often an unwritten culture. That brings us back to our colonial past, where truth and laughter live side by side. The simple impulse that gave us the seanachaí, poet and playwright also gave us stand-up. It would be extraordinary if the country that does comedy best does not recognise it.",
                "At this stage, I want to recognise the contributions of the other Deputies who spoke, including Deputies Mitchell, Cronin, Gibney, Ahern, Brennan and Heneghan, and the Minister of State. It was an interesting debate and it was useful to have it. I was not sure whether I ever wanted to hear some of the commentary about people's personal hygiene habits, but at the end of the day it was a bit of a joke and a laugh. We all laughed at it and we are all together. We did not fall out and we will not fall out on this matter. I can see the headlines tomorrow about all the comedians in the Dáil and how many of them are connected. One of the jobs of a comedian is to force us to look through laughter at our lives and positions and make sure that we can laugh at ourselves as well as at the world. Even in the toughest times the jokes, craic and comedy are what breaks the ice.",
                "I hope the Minister, in the less than two weeks we have before we come back here to vote, will reconsider his decision to have an 18-month delay and adopt Deputy Ahern's amendment. If he wants to proceed with the delay, I would be happy to accept the amendment to ensure a short delay. It would be the same as passing the Bill today. The arts committee is booked up until Christmas and early into the new year. Let us adopt the Bill and continue the debate. Let us make sure that comedians in Ireland get their due recognition."

                    "My question relates to the lack of a school dental programme in County Monaghan. I submitted a parliamentary question on this and the response I got was very disturbing, to be honest. We all know that in all areas of health care, early intervention is crucial. Prevention is preferable to treatment. Issues identified early allow for less intensive or invasive treatment. It is positive to introduce and reinforce positive dental hygiene and care from an early age. Dental is among the most basic of health services, so the Minister of State will appreciate my shock to receive a response from the HSE to a parliamentary question which outlined that no children in County Monaghan received a dental check-up in the last academic year. Actually, shocked does not go far enough; I was disgusted, to be honest. The HSE informed me that the reason for this was staff retirements, maternity leaves and the paucity of dentists available nationally. It is not too much for the people of Monaghan to ask the Minister that this service would be put in place immediately. Retirements are generally foreseeable and should not lead to collapse in the services. Maternity leave is a fairly common life experience which should not leave to a collapse in the service. Will the Minister of State ensure that the people of County Monaghan get their routine dentistry requirements and check-ups in national school?",
                    "It is also a question of accountability for the HSE and the Government on this matter. This scandal that no children in County Monaghan are receiving dental check-ups has brought both me and the Minister of State into the House this morning. What has brought us to this point is a broader mismanagement and, given the latest revelation, I would say maladministration of our dental services. At the heart of the issue is Government's failure to train enough dentists and overreliance on private dentists who are under no obligation to deliver this critical public service. To go from 770 children in 2021 who did receive routine check-ups to zero children last year in County Monaghan who received a dental check-up, leaving 832 children on a waiting list, is undeniably a collapse of the service. Does the Minister of State accept that there has been another collapse in the HSE school-linked dental programme in County Monaghan? What is she going to do about it and when is she going to do it? How many children in Monaghan will receive a check-up in this academic year?"

                    "I thank the Deputy. This is a very serious issue for children who are waiting for public dental assessment in the Deputy's county of Monaghan. The HSE oral healthcare service aims to provide an oral examination and necessary treatment for children between second and sixth class and, in some cases, fourth class. Emergency care is provided for children of all ages up to 16 and for those with complex and additional needs. Due to the nature of the oral health examination programme, it does not meet the usual definition of a formal waiting list. However, children are deemed eligible on 1 September when they commence the relevant academic year.",
                    "The Department of Health engages with the HSE on an ongoing basis to understand and address any challenges arising in the provision of public oral healthcare services. The Minister for Health is aware that there are backlogs in the HSE’s child oral health examination programme which has meant that sixth class groups are being prioritised. Currently, capacity in the Cavan-Monaghan area is impacted by maternity leave which is reducing service provision. I take into account what the Deputy has said about the children over the last year who have not had a check-up. She can be assured that it will go back to the Department and the Minister for Health, Deputy Carroll MacNeill. The public dental service in Monaghan is currently targeting children in the 2023-24 academic year, 65% of whom have received assessments. There are 832 consents received from parents for children in the 2024-25 academic year who are waiting for appointments. So far in 2025, 425 sixth class targeted assessments have been completed in the Cavan-Monaghan area.",
                    "The Government acknowledges that more needs to be done to ensure these children can access their examination appointment. Building on investment of over €230 million per year in public oral healthcare services, an additional €2 million was awarded in budget 2025 to recruit 15 additional oral healthcare WTEs nationally. The Deputy is right that one of the biggest issues is recruitment. As she said, there may be staff out on maternity leave or there could be vacancies. That is an issue and a challenge for us. The good news for us is that there was funding in budget 2025 to recruit 15 additional oral healthcare WTEs nationally.",
                    "In the longer term, the Minister recognises that oral healthcare needs to be modernised in line with best international evidence and practice, as set out in the national oral health policy, Smile agus Sláinte. The €2 million budget 2025 investment will increase to €4 million in 2026. This supports the delivery of a three-year implementation plan for the policy, which is currently being finalised for publication by the Department of Health and the HSE. Service reform is vital to improve access to services in the long term, to ensure care is accessible from birth and is prevention based. The policy also highlights the need for strategic workforce planning to ensure a sufficient number of appropriately trained oral healthcare professionals, to include dentists, dental hygienists, dental nurses and other auxiliary grades. The Department of Health will continue to work with the HSE to continue to address any challenges arising in the provision of oral healthcare services and ensure the implementation of necessary reforms."

                    "I want to reiterate that although 900 people were assessed in Cavan, in County Monaghan zero children were assessed. That needs to change and something needs to happen immediately. Sinn Féin outlined our proposals to address the crisis fostered by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael in our dental services. A year ago, my party colleague and Sinn Féin spokesperson, Deputy Cullinane, published our health plan. It highlighted that between 2019 and 2024, nearly half of dentists providing publicly funded care to medical card holders had withdrawn from the dental treatment services scheme. Nearly 80% of those who remained were not taking on new patients. The Government's oversight of the denial of services has been seen in low-income households that have been denied the opportunity to save teeth and prevent oral disease. In the long term, it will cost households and the State more. The Government has not heeded the warnings from the Dental Council of Ireland, the Irish Dental Association or Sinn Féin and we are dealing with the consequences. We can now pay heed to Sinn Féin's plan. The Minister of State needs to do this. We need to hire more dentists and dental care teams to target school screening for children and medical card holders. Sinn Féin would expand dental training places by 32% from 185 to 245, develop a modern general dental services contract, crucially including a public-only contract, and make necessary reforms to the Dentists Act. A year ago, Sinn Féin said we needed to get dental screening programmes in schools back on track. In my county of Monaghan, the programme has come off the tracks entirely. Will the Government implement the necessary measures that I have outlined?",

These are the people who are doing the work on the front line in communities affected by drug abuse. I hope to hear differently from the Minister of State but it seems as though this Government is continuing the policy we have seen over the past ten years or so of what is the effective slow strangulation of our drug and alcohol task forces.",

It has almost doubled and yet core funding for local drug and alcohol task forces decreased by 4.5%. In its new budget, the Government is saying that there is no cut to funding for community drug services in 2026 but when we dig into the detail, that does not seem to be the case. The first year cost of auto-enrolment for drug task forces will be 1.5%. That will increase year on year but in the first year, we are talking about a cost of 1.5%. There is no funding provided to enable the task forces to meet that. That is a crisis for them. These people want their staff to be able to access pensions but this needs to be resourced. Where are they meant to come up with this money? There is no uplift for these projects to cover the rising cost of living, so it certainly looks like a cut in core funding because extra costs are being put on them without extra resources being provided for it.",

This is an interagency project to respond to drug-related intimidation. This programme is rolled out in different task forces across the country. In Whitechurch in my constituency, the Whitechurch addiction support project, which is supported through DRIVE, caters to 75 families. These families are receiving threats from drug dealers. It is an horrific situation to be in. I have spoken to people in this situation many times. Because of DRIVE, the project was able to hire a dedicated worker for families experiencing drug-related intimidation. It managed to get two-year funding for this from the community safety innovation fund. That funding has now ceased and the project does not know what it will do from 1 January. What support will it be able to provide for the 75 families it was able to help in the past year? I hope it is just an error and that funding is being provided for DRIVE, so I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's response on that.",

There is a saying from the disability rights movement \"nothing about us without us\" and yet here the people on the ground providing the services are not being included in the development of the implementation of the new national drugs strategy."

                    "In addition, I ask the Minister of State to address the exclusion of the local drugs and alcohol task forces from the reference group to support the implementation of the new national drugs strategy. She said that they are an integral part of the delivery of this, but it does not look like they are an integral part when they are not being included in it. I look forward to answers to those questions. I repeat the point that it certainly looks to me, and I think to many other people on the ground, that there is a slow strangulation of these task forces, which are providing vital services on the front line. Applications can be made for things like the community services enhancement fund, but that is not a substitute to core funding. That is what we hear from the task forces all the time. It is not a substitute because they cannot make long-term plans on the basis that they apply for this grant now. They need to be able to have permanent staff and be able to provide a future for people. They need to be able to pay for their pensions, so the key thing is core funding."

                    "I welcome the announcement by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Browne, regarding the new initiative that will allow private sector involvement in developing wastewater systems for smaller housing developments of up to 40 homes. This initiative is a crucial step towards addressing the infrastructure deficit in rural areas, particularly in County Kerry, where housing development has been long restricted by a lack of adequate wastewater facilities. By enabling developers to collaborate with Uisce Éireann on low-volume wastewater systems, the Government is providing a much-needed solution that will accelerate housing delivery in areas that are currently stifled by infrastructure bottlenecks. This will help to alleviate some of the pressure on our smaller towns and villages where housing demand has far outpaced the availability of wastewater treatment options. In my own county, over 40 villages do not have any wastewater treatment facilities, while a number of others have been at capacity for 20 or 25 years. Constructed wetlands, as I previously mentioned in the House, are a cheaper and faster way to provide wastewater treatment and they are environmentally friendly. However, this is a positive move.",
                    "It is essential to recognise that wastewater infrastructure alone will not solve the broader housing crisis in rural Ireland. In counties like Kerry we also face significant policy challenges that prevent many families from building homes on their own land. The national planning framework and the 2005 sustainable rural housing guidelines currently restrict many rural applicants from building family homes, especially when their land is located outside designated areas for housing development. There is a circle around most towns and villages in Kerry where no development is allowed unless you are actively farming. These are towns and villages that are supposed to be under strong urban pressure. This has to be removed or at the very least, the planning restrictions must be eased. These guidelines, though well intentioned, have often led to unintended consequences in rural communities. Many families who want to build on their own land or buy a site to build a home are unable to do so because of restrictions that were designed for a different era, when rural populations were much smaller. Kerry's rural communities in particular are struggling with these outdated policies which have hindered housing growth and caused unnecessary hardship for local families and communities.",
                    "While the Minister's initiative on wastewater infrastructure is an important part of the puzzle, it must be complemented by a more flexible and forward-thinking approach to planning policy. Local authorities must be given greater discretion to approve developments based on local needs rather than being bound by rigid national guidelines that fail to reflect the realities on the ground. We are in the middle of a housing crisis, as we all know, and we must not lose sight of that. The current planning policy and conditions and the lack of infrastructure is forcing applicants onto our housing lists. Many of these are in a position to build a house and they can afford it, and they can afford also to get a mortgage, but we are forcing them, through these policies, onto our housing lists. The Minister's announcement yesterday is an important step towards addressing the pressing need for infrastructure development in Kerry. It is critical that we continue to look at innovative solutions for wastewater systems that will allow for faster, more sustainable development in rural areas. As I have referenced already, constructed wetlands are a far speedier and cost-effective option. Where necessary, two or three can be constructed, for example. In Beaufort, just outside Killarney, two years ago, €6 million was announced for a sewerage scheme. I was told recently by Uisce Éireann that it will take at least another seven years. That is almost ten years, which is not good enough and needs to be addressed. As I have outlined, we must also address the broader issue of planning restrictions that continue to prevent many families in Kerry and throughout Ireland from building a family home on their own land."

In line with the programme for Government commitment to continue to support one-off rural housing, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is considering how best to proceed with updated rural housing guidelines in the form of a national planning statement on rural housing. This work will replace the current rural housing guidelines and will continue to enable development plans to provide for housing in the countryside based on the considerations detailed in the national planning framework. This will be balanced with the need to manage development in certain areas, including areas around cities and larger towns and environmentally sensitive areas, to avoid overdevelopment.",

The vast majority of one-off houses - well in excess of 90% - are built in rural settings. Notwithstanding the need for updated rural housing guidelines, planning permission has been granted for almost 6,000 one-off houses on average every year since 2020. One-off houses constituted 20% of housing completions over the past five years, with an average of 5,200 completed per annum. It is also important to assure the House that both current and future planning guidelines will continue to enable county development plans to provide for rural housing. Furthermore, the Department is a key participant in the development of the new Our Rural Future policy, which will take effect from 2026, and regularly engages with the Department of Rural and Community Development and the Gaeltacht on housing and the necessary infrastructure to support housing development."

Another area that must be addressed is the restrictions on national primary and secondary roads where unless a person's application for a house is in a section of road with a limit under 60 km/h, then they are out. The Ring of Kerry is an example of this. Other examples include the roads from Castleisland to Tralee, Castleisland to Farranfore, Tralee to Dingle, Tralee to Listowel and on to Tarbert, Killarney to Rathmore, and many others. The Government must reform these national policies to ensure that families in rural Ireland are not locked out of the opportunities to build homes where they live.

It is the only option for many families today, sadly, but they would be more than happy with such a house. In many cases, they are of such a high quality that they would last 60, 70 or 80 years.",

I want to see couples around Killarney, Killorglin, Cahersiveen, Dingle, Kenmare and Castleisland being allowed to build a family home. Fianna Fáil is committed to ensuring that no community is left behind. We will continue to work towards a more flexible and responsive planning system that allows families to build homes on their own land and contribute to the growth and sustainability of our rural communities.

                    "Ar an gcéad dul síos, ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil for allowing me to table this Topical Issue today. I declare an interest in that a company I am involved in does some work for Irish Water. No disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Richmond, but I am disappointed that the Minister or the Minister of State with responsibility is not here. That is the real problem. There is absolutely zero accountability with Irish Water to us public representatives or, never mind us, to the public who depend on this water. Clonmel town - Deputy Murphy was here and he is as well aware as I am - is a chronic situation. I spoke to a company five minutes ago. They have been onto me every week. Sixty-five jobs are about to leave the town because the company cannot use the water. It has to bring in tankers to have clean water to use for its manufacturing product. The jobs are leaving and going to the northeast - just imagine. This is chronic. There are people in charge who do not have a clue and do not seem care.",
                    "I meet engineering staff who I talk to, and they understand the water. I meet executives, different executives and more executives. They are bamboozled talking about investments. There are investments going on - we accept that - but there is also damage being done to the water services that have supplied Clonmel for a century and a half. Clonmel, before Irish Water took over and until recently, was using 220 cu. m of water per hour. That was being supplied from Glenary and the reservoir south of the town up on the Comeraghs. That was being supplied by one 10 in. main in around Kilmacomma and one 7 in. main going to the reservoir. They took out the 7 in. main, with a big investment, put in a 9 in. main and increased the water into the reservoir, but they would not listen to anybody and increased the pipes going out. Then what did they do? They sabotaged the 10 in. main, which had been laid about 22 years ago. I remember it well. It could supply so much of the water into the town and now we are depending on the reservoir and the plant. It is under pressure. Every evening it is down, down, down low. It cannot maintain this. I argued this with Irish Water, as did others, prior to it doing this work. The contractors that did it knew it was madness. Imagine that they capped the main going into Kilmacomma, County Waterford. It is a 10 in. PVC main, but other mains have asbestos and suffer from other kinds of poor quality. This is a perfect main. It supplies two thirds of the town, including the hospital. For the first time ever, the hospital ran out of water two weeks ago and it had to get in tankers. This is sinful and shameful that Irish Water can do this kind of blackguarding with no recourse to anybody. It has men there who know the system, but it does not want to engage with them. It has transferred one of them to Carrick-On-Suir. He knows the water intimately, but this is the kind of blackguarding. It does not know and does not want to listen, but it is shocking that it can sabotage the main and people then have dirty water and boil water notices for months in the Ardfinnan regional water scheme.",
                    "They have been on it since early September. The agency now intends to move on to the Galtee's plant, which it is going to wreck as well. Somebody has to rein it in, make it accountable and not give it copious more billions to put in infrastructure. I welcome the millions that will be provided for infrastructure because we cannot wait for Irish Water. It is unfit for purpose. It is a monstrosity that was created here by the Fine Gael Government and the sooner it is disbanded and taken down, the better. The businesses that are paying a fortune to this company for water are entitled to a service. Households are entitled to have clean drinking water that is reliable and safe, as are the hospitals, doctors' surgeries and other such places.",
                    "I am in the centre of the town. In my office we have a lovely water supply from Poulavanogue. It has been there for 200 years. They are going to disconnect that even though the supply flows down into the town and never gives trouble. That is the case at the moment, and it was also the case in the summer and last year when there was trouble all over the town. We had a water supply in the centre of the town. However, they are going to disconnect that. They tell us they cannot upgrade it to meet the standards. It is sabotage and nothing else. If they are not stopped soon, they will drive away employment and jobs and drive people to insanity."

Uisce Éireann has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local level. The Minister has no function regarding the specific Uisce Éireann operations to which the Deputy refers. The Environmental Protection Agency, in turn, as environmental regulator, is responsible for setting quality standards and enforcing compliance with EU directives and national regulations for the provision of drinking water. As the public health authority, it is the HSE's decision regarding issuing a boil water notice.",

                    "Uisce Éireann is committed to investing significantly in Clonmel to deliver a more robust, resilient water supply that will include upgraded treatment facilities, storage and an upgraded network. Uisce Éireann has confirmed that the delivery of a strategic multimillion euro investment to modernise and upgrade the water assets across the town is well under way. When complete, this will provide local homes and businesses with a safer, more reliable water supply into the future.",

The area has been subject to ongoing operational issues impacting homes and businesses, including intermittent boil water notices and unplanned interruptions to supply. While these works are ongoing, Uisce Éireann has been in contact with the customers in question to keep them informed of progress being made to lift the boil water notice. The Uisce Éireann water charges plan sets out a compensation mechanism when water quality is compromised and unfit for human consumption such as when boil water and drinking water restriction notices apply. Business customers who pay charges can follow up with Uisce Éireann as they may be entitled to a rebate. The Department's priority is to ensure that people's health is protected and that adequate water is available for all consumers. We all want to see this notice lifted without undue delay, but only when the HSE and the EPA have confirmed the water supply is safe."

The investment here has done awful damage to the situation. We hear the buzzwords \"resilient\" and \"continuous supply\" but it is not resilient. We have had resilient supplies for generations at Poulavanogue - a gravity supply. Now, they must turn around and pump the water back up there. That does not make sense at all. I told the Minister of State we need 220 cu. m per hour and that has been restricted because we moved the 10 in. pipe. They put a 4 in. pipe into a housing estate in County Waterford, Kilmacomma, and they tapped it, which means that it cannot be used any more in an emergency. The hospital was never without water until two weeks ago. Imagine our hospital having to get in tankers. Business are crippled with enough charges and they need a supply of water. They are paying dearly for water in and water out.",

No physical persons are going out there when we have heavy downpours of rain and cleaning the screens, which they always did. I refer to Mr. Hartigan, the late P.J. Cullinan and Joe Carrigan, who is still with us. Many other people went out and cleaned the sieves and the water went. Now we are waiting for a computer to send a message to somebody who may or may not answer his phone. The workers are fatigued and disgusted. The Minister is trying to move them over to Irish Water. There are good workers and excellent county council staff over the country. We could not have better in south Tipperary than the team of people we have. They are being bullied to go into a company in which they no faith. They are ashamed to drive the vans with the names on the side of them. That is what they tell me. They have no intention of going to Irish Water. We will have a worse situation when their expertise, knowledge and capability to fix the mains and look after the network is gone. We are going from bad to worse unless someone takes a hold of this. We will lose jobs and business people. People's health is being damaged, including their mental health, because they have no water and then they have dirty water."

I raise this issue today because there is an urgent need to finally close the loophole that allows drivers to continue renewing learner permits indefinitely without ever sitting a driving test. Of course, this is not a new problem. It was identified more than a decade ago in the RSA's Road Safety Strategy 2013-2020. Action 33 of the strategy clearly commits to addressing this loophole with a completion date of quarter 1 of 2014. Eleven years later, this loophole still has not been closed.",
                    "I acknowledge the Minister's ongoing work, and that of the RSA, in improving waiting times for driving tests. We know that waiting times have been reducing steadily and additional testers have been recruited. This progress deserves recognition. The current waiting time is averaging ten weeks and we need to get it lower. There is a capacity in the system to do 7,200 tests on a weekly basis.",
                    "However, the issue of multiple successive learner permits remains a glaring gap in our road safety framework. I acknowledge all those who have lost their lives this year - 147 people. I also think of their families today. I also want to acknowledge the work of PARC, the road safety advocacy group, in particular Susan Gray, with whom I work very closely in my role as Chair of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport.",
                    "According to the RSA, more than 56,000 people currently hold three or more learner permits and many of them have never once sat a driving test. The situation is deeply unfair to the majority of learners who do the right thing - those who complete their lessons, prepare properly and take the test when they are ready. It also undermines public confidence in the system. The RSA confirmed before an Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport committee meeting in June that draft regulations have been prepared to deal with this issue and the process with the Department is at final engagement stage. The RSA expects implementation to be imminent. These regulations will, as I understand it, limit renewals to three learner permits and require a person to sit a driving test before a further renewal is granted. I believe that is a fair, balanced and long overdue reform, but it needs to happen now. A related issue, which must be tackled at the same time, is the growing number of no-shows for driving tests.",
                    "In July and August alone, over 6,000 hours of testers' time were lost because candidates simply did not turn up. In fact, it was 2,000 candidates. That is the equivalent of hundreds of extra tests that could be carried out, tests that people who are desperately waiting could have taken. I understand efforts are being made to reduce waiting times but unless this loophole is closed and the no-show rate is addressed, the system will continue to face unnecessary pressure.",
                    "The Department's own statement from earlier this year said that secondary legislation is being prepared to give effect to this change and the RSA is finally finalising its implementation plan. I urge the Minister of State to bring those regulations forward without delay because every month that passes is another month where this loophole continues to undermine road safety and fairness. This reform has been promised for over a decade; it is now time to deliver it."

                    "The Department of Transport is committed, under action 7B of the road safety strategy phase 2 action plan, to addressing the issue of learner drivers with multiple successive learner permits and, in particular, those who have never taken a practical test. In 2019, the Road Safety Authority, RSA, made proposals on reducing the number of multiple subsequent learner permit holders. However, with Covid-19, driver testing shut down and was then greatly restricted, leading from 2023 on to significantly longer waiting times for tests. Accordingly, there was not sufficient capacity to cope with the additional initial demand for testing that might arise from these measures. As alluded to by the Deputy already, the average waiting time for a B car test is now ten weeks, a significant improvement on the 27-week average in April and a return to the service level agreement target. There is now no barrier in testing capacity to the introduction of these changes.",
                    "We know, however, from RSA data that a significant number of learners renew their permits for many years without ever taking a test, rather than going through the learning process and becoming qualified drivers. As of September 2025, nearly 63,000 people, or 19% of all learners, have renewed their car permits three or more times. Of those 63,000 learners, 60%, or nearly 38,000, have never taken a driving test.",
                    "Under this proposal, a learner, after holding a permit for four years, must take a practical test before renewing their permit. For most learners, this will be for their third permit. After seven years, the learner, to continue learning to drive, begins the process again - theory test, learner permit, 12 essential driver-training lessons and the practical test. A learner permit is not a driver licence. It allows the holder to drive on public roads, accompanied by a qualified driver, while learning to drive. Until a learner completes the process and becomes a qualified driver, they cannot be judged safe to drive unaccompanied on public roads. As learners may not currently drive on public roads unaccompanied, these changes will not affect the independence or mobility of any learners who comply with road traffic law, including older and rural learners.",
                    "The learning-to-drive process sets out the knowledge, skill and competency needed to become a licensed driver. These changes will improve road safety by encouraging learners to become qualified drivers and not remain in the learning process. It is considered that seven years is more than enough time for the vast majority of learners to achieve this.",
                    "The Minister of State, Deputy Canney, intends to sign the regulations for these changes very shortly. The RSA will then contact those directly affected with information on the changes. The Minister of State remains extremely grateful to the Deputy for raising this in the Chamber this morning."

As the Minister of State knows, this issue has been flagged repeatedly by the RSA and by the transport committee, of which, as he said, I am Chair, but more importantly by the public and road victims advocacy groups, in particular Promoting Awareness, Responsibility and Care, PARC. The commitment dates back to 2014 but we still have a situation where tens of thousands of drivers can legally stay on the road without ever proving they are competent to drive. Some of those 60,000 are in receipt of learner permits on more than 20 occasions.",

I know the RSA published its action plan to reduce waiting times back in May. I suggest now that this action plan is updated with this significant additional load of 60,000. It is really important that we maintain waiting times at around ten weeks and that capacity in the system to do 7,200 tests on a weekly basis.",
                    "On the issue of no-shows, can the Minister outline what measures are being considered to reduce the rate of missed tests? As I said, there were 1,000 missed tests in July and another 1,000 in August. I am still waiting for the figures for September. Will it be through improved notifications, rescheduling, flexibility or perhaps penalties for repeated absences? Again, this is not about punishment. It is ensuring that the learner system works as intended, that it promotes good driving habits and that it protects all road users. It is about implementation. I welcome that either the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, signed the regulations yesterday or that the signing of the regulation is imminent. The RSA is ready. It is time to act now."

                    "I am very grateful to Deputy Murphy for raising this. From a road safety perspective, it is vital that learners are encouraged to complete the learning-to-drive process and become fully qualified drivers, and that people do not hold learner permits without ever taking a driving test. The RSA has a communication plan to engage with multiple learner permit holders. This will provide clear, targeted information to affected learners setting out the changes and providing information regarding testing options and supports available. It is important to remember that learners must always be accompanied by someone with a current driver licence for the same type of vehicle. They must have held that licence for at least two years and display L plates on the front and rear of the vehicles they are driving.",
                    "As stated, it is illegal for anyone with a learner permit to drive on a public road unaccompanied. The following penalties apply to a learner convicted of driving unaccompanied. If you are unaccompanied and the vehicle owner, you are liable to have your vehicle impounded. If you are unaccompanied but not the vehicle owner, the owner faces their vehicle being impounded and being fined up to €1,000. In addition, there are penalty points and fines for unaccompanied learners - up to four penalty points and a fine of up to €160.",
                    "In closing, the safety of all road users is a guiding principle behind driver licensing law. Road safety is promoted by ensuring that all learners meet a high standard of ability, attain sufficient driving experience and training and prove their ability to drive safely by passing a driving test. With regard to the two specific queries raised by Deputy Murphy, I will, of course, pass them on to the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, and ask him to reply to the Deputy directly."

                "As a proud TD for Dublin Central and the communities of Dublin Central, it is unconscionable to me that we have people dying in our streets and in our communities from drugs overdoses and that Ireland has one of the highest number of drug-induced deaths when compared with every other country across the European Union. To me, it is the antithesis of our Republic and our values to respect the dignity of every individual that people are shamed and stigmatised into not seeking and getting the help and support they need. Addiction must be recognised for what it is - not a criminal justice problem, but a social and health need. This is not some perceived stigma. It is very real. It is real when mothers with an addiction go to ground and hide away for fear that their children will be taken away from them; it is real when we hear from young people of their fears of lifelong convictions if they seek help; it is real when people across the greater Leinster area have to travel to Dublin for opiate stabilisation programmes provided by a small number of GPs, and indeed that happens right across the country; and it is real when I look at the people in my community and the communities across Dublin Central - across Dublin 1, 3, 7 and 9 - who have been ravaged for years by deprivation, poverty and trauma and who see no hope, no future and no opportunity.",
                "That is why we are passionate about introducing a comprehensive health-led approach for drug use in this country, and that is why we feel so strongly that decriminalisation of the drug user has to be a crucial part of that process. The powerful work of the citizens' assembly made clear that decriminalisation was one of three parts in moving to a comprehensive health-led approach alongside health diversion and dissuasive sanctions. My question to Minister of State and Government this morning is: is this Government committed to decriminalisation of the drug user? Is it committed to implementing the full intent of the citizens' assembly report to this Oireachtas? To date, it is not clear that it is. As Mr. Paul Reid powerfully told us last year when he appeared before our Oireachtas joint committee on drugs reform, the members of the citizens' assembly were stunned by the length of time it has taken to introduce the most modest of changes to drug policy, and that commitments made back in 2017 - almost a decade ago - on a health diversion approach are still not implemented.",
                "Now, in 2025, we have those clear recommendations from the citizens' assembly. We have detailed recommendations from the Oireachtas joint committee on drugs reform, of which I was privileged to be part in the previous Oireachtas, yet we see them effectively ignored in the programme for Government. There is not a single mention of decriminalisation. All this year, we have been hearing that we are finally going to get a health diversion scheme but we still have no detail and, crucially, we have no clear sense of whether decriminalisation is part of a future plan. We need the Minister of State to be straight with us because if the health diversion approach is as far as this Government is preparing to go, then she needs to tell us. She needs to tell everybody in the Gallery, and she needs to make it known because there is an expectation that decriminalisation should and must happen in this country. I want to say to her that I do not believe a health diversion approach will work. The citizens’ assembly clearly rejected that approach. We know from the experience of Portugal and many other countries that a halfway house will not work because as long as gardaí remain involved in stop-and-search operations and spending precious Garda hours prosecuting personal possession in actions that are corrosive to building good community relations, we will make no progress towards a comprehensive health-led approach.",
                "I would like now for us to be in a conversation about how we do decriminalisation in Ireland. How do we make it work for individuals and for their communities? That is the work of the Oireachtas joint committee on drug reform that is currently meeting and that will report next June. However, everything that we have heard from Government this year makes me feel that we are going backwards, not forwards. The reality - the beauty for Ireland - is that there are so many lessons we can learn from the many countries that have adopted decriminalisation, from Portugal to Switzerland to Vancouver and the failures in Canada as to what worked well and what did not. We know from the work of the previous Oireachtas joint committee and from the current work, and we need to build on that, that there should be no legal limit for personal possession. To introduce one would be to undermine the very process of taking away the judgment, profiling and targeting of those who use drugs.",
                "Decriminalisation has to be accompanied by a dramatic increase in investment into services. Our public spaces must remain public and safe for everyone to use. We do not accept that large groups should be consuming alcohol in public and the same should apply to drugs. I am very conscious that there are so many residents in this city and in communities across the country who are dealing with the impact of dealing on their doorsteps, drug consumption in back lanes and on our streets and all that goes with that. The thing is, however, that those buying and consuming are also suffering a huge shortage of dignity and a lack of safety. That is why we have to have the safe injection centre in Merchants Quay made permanent. That is why we need to have safe consumption centres rolled out in Cork, Limerick and all those other major urban areas. The reality now, of course, is that drug consumption is no longer predominantly about injecting; it is about smoking, and we need to incorporate safe smoking facilities in the future.",
                "We know Merchants Quay saved something like 65 lives in the first six months of this year. That is life-changing to those individuals and that needs to be rolled out across the country.",
                "In just over a year, we will be marking 30 years since the establishment of the drug and alcohol task forces in this country, a groundbreaking initiative introduced by then Minister, Pat Rabbitte. They have been the backbone of organising service provision and identifying local need in that time. I am proud to be a member of the north inner city drug and alcohol task force, under the great work of Dr. Austin O'Carroll and Brian O'Reilly. However, it is important to say there are very serious concerns about the Department's attitude to the task forces and the groups working at the coalface, a cut in the most recent budget to the task forces and the exclusion of organisations from the steering group on the new national drugs strategy. That is not how it should be done.",
                "To its credit, the Department has recognised the need for investment. It is wonderful that it backed the need for the addiction treatment facility in Usher's Island to be built last year and that €37 million of taxpayers' money went into this wonderful 100-bed facility. However, it is unconscionable and shameful that this Government is leaving 37 beds empty this winter for the sake of a small amount of money that could save lives. I ask the Minister of State to make that direct intervention to ensure the Simon Community facility on Usher's Island, which helps those in addiction and who are homeless, get the care and services they need.",
                "To the future, we know what a health approach looks like. We need to make sure that naloxone is available across our communities and that families and pharmacists can easily and readily administer it. We need to make sure testing is widely available. At music festivals during the summer, we saw the HSE promote that, and that was wonderful, but we need to ensure that is much more widely available. In Paris and in other cities across Europe, people can walk in with their drugs - they do not know the potency of them - and get them tested. We know we need to have much greater investment into harm reduction and recovery.",
                "I pay tribute to the incredible work being done in the communities in my constituency and across the country, to SAIL, which is celebrating 30 years of its existence this morning, and to the other organisations that work day in, day out for those who use drugs and who are in addiction. They are often not properly recognised and do not get the resources they need. They need to be supported to ensure those who need help get it."

That experience convinced me our system is broken. People are stigmatised and not supported through addiction and people's lives have been changed irrevocably by criminalisation and yet the last major policy breakthrough was brought about when Aodhán Ó Ríordáin was Minister and who successfully legislated for safe consumption areas. The long-promised first medically supervised injecting centre finally opened in December 2024 in Dublin, nearly a decade after Aodhán’s initiative. However, as our new motion notes, no further progress has been made on additional safe consumption spaces or on a change in policy. Yet, more and more people are seeking treatment for problem drug use, new synthetic substances are emerging and the 2024 European Drug Report shows Ireland’s rate of drug deaths is among the very highest in the EU.",

We need to look at other countries like Portugal where they redirected users from the courts to the health services and reduced overdose deaths. We need to look at the blueprint for reform offered in this motion. We call for a dedicated Cabinet committee on drugs use, for a comprehensive health-led response to possession and, crucially, for the decriminalisation of people found with drugs for personal use through repeal of section 3 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1997. We want to see funding for harm-reduction services and genuine involvement of people with lived experience.",

On the one hand, the State acknowledges the illness of addiction but on the other hand endorses sending people to prisons where drug use is rife. We are telling people to use safely on the one hand and then criminalising them for doing so on the other.",

                "My colleague and Labour MEP for Dublin, Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, has led the charge - as has rightly been said - on this issue in Ireland for a number of years now and he is continuing to lead the way in Europe.",
                "The most obvious example to follow in a European context is that of Portugal. One thing is crystal clear from the Portuguese example, that is, moving to a health-based and approach away from punishment, reduces serious harms from drug use. Portugal has more than 20 years’ experience under its belt and in the first two decades of this approach, it saw deaths from drug use and incidents of HIV tumble, as well as a fall in prison the population. In 1999, it saw 369 people lose their lives due to overdose. By 2016, that figure had tumbled to just 30. HIV diagnoses due to drug injection also fell dramatically over the same period. In 2000, there were 907 such diagnoses, falling to just 18 in 2017.",
                "Another benefit to this approach to drug use will be to reduce the pressure on prison places. As long as the change in policy is matched by multi-annual resourcing of health and addiction services and supports for people who use drugs, we have a chance here to take a transformational approach to drug use and make a meaningful reduction in the harm caused by drugs.",
                "The endless Garda hours used chasing people who use drugs can be turned on those who profit from the misery caused by the sale and trafficking of drugs. The citizens' assembly has done tremendous work on this issue. Recommendation 17 from its report argues for the introduction of a “comprehensive health-led response to possession of drugs for personal use.\" While possession of controlled drugs would remain illegal, people found in possession of illicit drugs for personal uses would be afforded “extensive opportunities to engage voluntarily with health-led services”, the citizens' assembly recommendation explained.",
                "For this policy to work, the citizens' assembly laid out the supports that need to be in place in the following recommendation, that is, recommendation 18. It says very clearly:",
                "Government should allocate significant additional funding on a multi-annual basis to drugs services across the statutory, community and voluntary sectors, to address existing service gaps, including in the provision of community-based and residential treatment services, to support the implementation of the recommendations of the Citizens’ Assembly.",
                "Quite frankly, this has not been the case and has not been so for successive governments. Without that funding, any policy change will be set up to fail. The services are already in place on the ground in many communities but by God they are stretched. They need certainty and multi-annual funding. Services like Red Door in my hometown of Drogheda provide vital support to those in addiction and are ready - they stand ready, willing and able - to do more if given the resources to do so and if we can introduce the kind of transformational change we need in drugs policy in this country to support people who need it most."

I acknowledge my colleague, Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, who has certainly influenced me and I would say many others on this issue.

With 10,000 people arrested every year for having drugs on them for personal consumption reasons, the number of man hours being taken up for An Garda Síochána is absolutely crazy. We need a policy change, and the Government needs to be brave about it. I raise the volume of drug-induced deaths purely because people are often so helpless that they will not seek help. That is the bottom line. There is a stigma. There is a lack of pathways. There is a lack of empathy in some cases. We need an holistic approach across justice, across health and across community to help people. What has gone on in the past has failed. We have to acknowledge that as a country. I hope the Minister of State will be brave enough to come along with us. As a party we do not have to own this. We are just so empathetic on this issue we have to use our Private Members' time to push this forward as something that, as a country, we need deal with.",

We need a plan, as a country, not just on the criminal side and not just dealing with those bringing cocaine into this country but as a society we need to educate young people. I have gone to too many meetings at sporting clubs and met too many young people, and friends and neighbours of mine, who have become addicted to cocaine because of a lifestyle choice. In many cases these are middle class people who are purchasing this drug. I say as Chair of the sports committee that collectively as a society and all sporting organisations need to say enough is enough because it is in every sporting organisation in this country. Many young people think taking cocaine means they do take on calories, they do not have pints and do not drink as much, they do not have hangovers, etc. However, there are additional costs later on in life caused by the addiction I have seen in young people in my club, clubs around me and all over this country. We need a plan, particularly being led by sporting organisations, to actually address this."

As new Minister of State, I assure Members that I am very mindful that we are talking about families and people's lives. It is my absolute aim to make sure I work with the Department and other Members to work together on this. The previous Government set up the Citizens' Assembly on Drugs Use, and the Joint Committee on Drugs Use has been re-established in this term. I have engaged with the Seanad and next week I will meet with the joint committee, and I am looking forward to that. I intend to continue to work with all stakeholders to develop the next drugs strategy. It is very important for me that all of us work together to achieve this. This is not just a Dublin issue; this is a countrywide issue. I have seen it myself since becoming a Minister of State.",

I am very mindful of that. The health-led approach to drug use is set out in the national drugs strategy and the Government priority is to develop a successor strategy to cover the period 2026 to 2029. The work on a successor strategy will advance and I have established a time-bound, independently chaired steering group to provide oversight, guidance and expert advice in the drafting of the strategy. I have asked the group to complete their work and present a draft strategy for consideration by December 2025. That is my aim. We can see how important this is. This is what I have to do. As Deputy Kelly said, \"be brave\". I need to be brave now. I need to have the first draft of this strategy by December. That is what I want as Minister of State.",
                "The steering group is a technical group brought together to distil the citizens' assembly recommendations, independent evaluation and stakeholder consultations into a comprehensive successor national drugs strategy. The strategy will guide the development and delivery of a health-led approach to drugs over the next four years. The membership is drawn from Departments, associated agencies and people with lived experience. I am very mindful that we work with people with lived experience and clinical and research expertise. The steering group is supported by a reference group of stakeholders who compliment the technical expertise, ensuring the new strategy is informed by real-world knowledge and lived experience. That is what I am going on now. I totally agree with Members that it is all about families and people with lived experience. The membership is drawn from civil society, task forces, community-based service providers and family support services from around the country. A significant proportion have lived and living experience of drugs. Both groups are well advanced in their work and are on track to deliver the draft strategy by December 2025. I am committed to publishing the successor drugs strategy in early 2026 and I am determined to avoid delays, as was emphasized by the chairs of the citizens' assembly and the joint committees.",
                "The Government allocated over €300 million on drug-related public expenditure in 2023, including €160 million on drug services. This represents an increase of 28% on 2017 funding levels. A further €4.2 million and 34 posts for drug services and initiatives was secured in budget 2025. Additional investment of €11 million was secured in budget 2026 to address gaps in service provision. I am very mindful about services as well. It is very important that we have the services for anybody that needs to access services around the whole country. This funding will enhance access to and delivery of drug services in the community. It will also strengthen the prevention of drug use among children and young people and minimise the harms of drug use for families and communities.",
                "In developing the new strategy, we must consider the wide prevalence of problem drug use across society and provide appropriate services to meet the health and social needs of the diverse population groups who use drugs. A record figure of 13,295 cases were treated for problem drug use in 2024. This represents a 50% increase in the capacity of treatment places since 2017 and reflects our ongoing investment in expanding services. Demand for drug treatment is across all regions of the country, all age groups, men and women, people with children and those without, and those who are unemployed as well those in employment. We are looking across all the sectors. A supervised injecting facility opened in Dublin city in December 2024. I am delighted that during its first seven months, staff have assisted over 1000 clients and there have been over 120 interventions to prevent a fatal overdose. I have seen how the facility is helping to save lives. The facility will be evaluated over the 18-month pilot phase, and this will inform decisions about the continuation of the Dublin facility and the development of facilities in other regions. We are looking at that too.",

This scheme embodies the health-led approach to drugs and it will lead to better outcomes for people and communities. Along with the Minister for Justice, Home Affairs and Migration, I have agreed that the scheme will start on an administrative basis. While the possession of controlled drugs will remain illegal, people with drugs for personal use will be given the opportunity to engage voluntarily with healthcare services. Health and well-being are something I am mindful of. An Garda Síochána and the Director of Public Prosecutions are finalising the operational details. Once we have sign-off, the scheme will start at a national level. The scheme is in line with the recommendation of the citizens' assembly.",

The risk of drug overdose deaths can be reduced further by getting people into drug treatment and increasing access to Naloxone, which is the antidote for opioid-related overdose. My Department is working closely with the HSE to increase awareness and accessibility of Naloxone. That is really one of our key issues going forward. It is important that this lifesaving medication is made more accessible to support workers, peers, and family members.",
                "In 2024, 1,758 people participated in naloxone administration training and 6,944 units of naloxone were supplied by the HSE to services. I reaffirm my intention to publish as soon as possible the successor national drugs strategy covering the period from 2026 to 2029, accompanied by a two-year action plan. I will have an action plan every two years. That will be worked with all of us. There are several more actions we need to take. Drugs are changing all the time. This is a changing world. All of us in this House are very mindful of that. We cannot be complacent about the harms and dangers associated with illicit drug use and a volatile drugs market. It is imperative that we have a drugs strategy relevant to the times we live in that responds to the continuing health and societal problems presented by established and new illicit drugs; it is always changing. We also need to align our drugs strategy with the forthcoming EU drugs strategy and to reflect the urgency given to drugs by the Citizens' Assembly on Drugs Use. It is my intention to continue to engage with the Oireachtas, including the Joint Committee on Drug Use, in implementing the successor strategy so that there is cross-party support for the strategy.",
                "I am glad to be here. As I said, we are not opposing this motion. All of us need to work together. Drugs are a huge challenge across the whole country. It requires all of us working together through services and the drugs task force which was brought up earlier as a Topical Issue. We have 24 drug task forces around the country which do excellent work and are on the ground in communities and the different agencies attached. My aim as Minister of State is to work together to get the solutions, get the strategy right and get the services right for those who need them. That is what I intend to do."

I represent Limerick city, which the Minister of State knows well. Our city has been absolutely destroyed by drugs, whether the drug barons who prey on vulnerable communities or the crack cocaine epidemic that has ripped through our city. Limerick is unfortunately the crack cocaine capital of Ireland. It has ravaged so many people, even people I went to school with. When talking about drugs more generally, my colleague, Deputy Kelly, referenced cocaine. I cannot go on a night out without seeing people off their heads on cocaine. In fact, I have been routinely offered cocaine in pubs in my own city of Limerick. You see people filing into cubicles. They are not going in there to use the bathroom. I have even seen the effects of problematic cocaine use knock on my own front door. It destroys everything. It destroys people financially, relationally and sexually. Crack cocaine is the most evil and insidious of all drugs. Limerick, as I said, has unfortunately become the crack cocaine capital of Ireland. People travel to Limerick because the crack is cheap and they can buy it in some of the poorest estates in this entire country. There is a house in St. Mary's Park that the locals refer to as Aldi because people are bussed in from outside Limerick. We have another issue because we have an epidemic of sex work. Crack cocaine is so addictive that women are forced into sex work to pay for it. Now, we have an issue with a lot of pregnancies resulting from that.",
                "When it comes to treatment, bar the 30 detox beds in Bruree, people are often forced to travel to Dublin, Carlow or Athy, if they are lucky. When they finish treatment, they are often back into the 9 p.m. to 9 a.m. hostel in Limerick and the vicious cycle begins again. Drug use and problematic drug use are changing. The level of poly drug use in Limerick is incredibly worrying. There are certain treatment centres you cannot get into if you are in benzos, methadone, etc. That needs to be radically changed. That change starts with language. Calling sick, vulnerable people the j-word or \"druggies\" should not be considered acceptable. This comes from social inequality across the board. We have no psychiatric service in Limerick Prison. We had 92 drug overdoses in our prison system last year. While we have a recovery worker and a dual diagnosis team, we need much more. People from the most deprived areas are disproportionately impacted by this. We need an all-of-government approach to this issue. That starts with taking it out of the courts and into the healthcare system. Nearly 100 people in our prison system nearly died last year due to problematic drug use. That is shocking. It says clearly where we are going wrong."

                "Today, the Labour Party is calling for the urgent adoption of a comprehensive public health approach to the decriminalisation of possession of drugs for personal use and the development of safer consumption spaces. I thank my party colleague, Aodhán Ó Ríordáin, for his work over the past number of years. I thank the Minister of State for not opposing this motion. The purpose of this motion is clear - to highlight the failure of Ireland’s current drugs policy, to see through the work of the citizens’ assembly and, most importantly, to seek decriminalisation of people who use drugs. We have to be honest about drugs and addiction in Ireland. Drugs are in wide use in every community and, as referenced by a number of my colleagues, in every income bracket. This is not an issue confined to certain areas or disadvantaged communities. It is a nationwide issue and we need to change our approach. Criminalising the person has not worked. It has not reduced drug use. It has not reduced drug harm. Instead, it has trapped people in cycles of stigma, poverty and punishment. Current policy is a barrier to treatment, to rehabilitation and to people moving on with their lives. It is not grounded in evidence or respect for human dignity.",
                "When we talk about people who use drugs in our communities, too often the conversation starts with stigma and ends with punishment. The evidence from most other, progressive European countries tells us something different. It tells us that criminalisation does not solve the problem; it just drives people into further harm, stigma and isolation. When someone struggles with alcohol or gambling, we offer treatment and support but when it is drugs, we reach for punishment. That double standard has to end. In countries that have taken a different path, decriminalised possession for personal use and focused on a holistic approach, people are no longer dragged through the courts. Instead, they are referred to health services and social support panels. The results speak for themselves - drug-related deaths have dropped dramatically, rates of serious addiction have fallen and crime has dropped which in itself frees up the criminal justice system. People have rebuilt their lives without fear of being branded a criminal. This has been achieved alongside safe consumption spaces, heroin-assisted treatments and strong social supports. Crucially, overall drug use did not rise.",
                "Decriminalisation makes practical sense. It can reduce pressure on the courts, the Garda and our prison system. It was reported last month that it costs €99,000 to house a prisoner for a year. The current approach does not work. We know that addiction is not a choice, but recovery can be an option if we redirect services and funding into treatment and community supports. This would be a far better use of public money. We have an opportunity to build a model rooted in public health, housing, education and social support that saves lives instead of wasting them in courtrooms and prisons. Right now, too many people are caught in a revolving door in and out of prison and never given a real chance to recover. That cycle has to end but only if we have the courage to change our approach and to treat drug use as a health issue instead of a handcuffs issue. This motion is, above all, is about people."

In every small village, every rural area and every small town in this country, drug addiction is an issue. There is absolutely no doubt about that and it is communities that are being affected day in, day out.

It was my colleague, Deputy Kelly, who spoke about sporting clubs and I want to concentrate on that as well for a moment.

Sinn Féin policy does not align with the repealing of section 3 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, however, those caught with drugs for personal use should be offered every opportunity to engage with health-led services. This will keep people out of the criminal justice system. The establishment of the citizens' assembly was a major step in the right direction. The assembly allowed people to engage with experts, families, services and learn about international best practice. The final report was testament to people's commitment to an important and sensitive issue. Out of the assembly came the establishment of the joint committee. The committee was empowered under the terms of reference to consider the report of the Citizens' Assembly on Drugs Use and provide a response to the subject matter of the report, including a reasoned response to each of the 36 recommendations contained in the report. The recommendations are varied. They include calling on the Government to prioritise drug misuse, a whole-of-government response tackling the drug crisis and demanding that the Government must include key stakeholders when developing policy. However, when it came to the issue of responding to personal drug use, the assembly was crystal clear. It voted for a comprehensive health-led approach to drug use.",
                "A comprehensive health-led response diverts people towards health services and away from the criminal system. This response will greatly reduce or eliminate prospects of people being charged and convicted. The citizens' assembly recommendation of a comprehensive health-led response is focused on decriminalisation, diversion and dissuasion. It would ensure the State response to drug use as a health issue and not a criminal issue. Controlled drugs would remain illegal but those caught with drugs would be offered extensive opportunity to engage with health-led services. This is not to be confused with legalisation. The importation, sale, distribution and possession of a controlled substance would remain illegal.",
                "Reports early in the year confirmed that the Government would be introducing a long-awaited diversion scheme for people caught with drugs. This scheme does not in any way reflect the comprehensive health-led approach to drug use agreed by the citizens' assembly. The announcement is an attempt by the Department of justice to claw back control of drugs rather than allowing it become a public health issue. This will undermine the work being done by the joint committee, which is yet to complete its work. The three strikes and you are out referral system fails to recognise the complex and long waiting lists for residential treatment. A simple referral by a judge will not always allow someone gain access to the service they need. Imposing an arbitrary number of referrals to treatment services fails to recognise the causes and complexity of addiction. It also fails to recognise that it often takes several attempts at rehabilitation before somebody addicted to drugs will get into recovery.",
                "While acknowledging that every family may be affected by drug addiction, it does not affect every family or community in the same way. It moves from drug addiction to a drug crisis when playgrounds become open drug markets, when the school gates becomes sites of drug violence and when streets are held to ransom by violence and lack of policing. The issue is compounded by drug-related intimidation, waiting lists, lack of mental health services and poor housing conditions. Each of these issues highlights the total failure of governments to adequately respond to the drug crisis.",
                "Tackling the causes and consequences of the drugs crisis must be a political priority. Consecutive governments have allowed it to slip down the agenda and that must, and can, change.

The national drug strategy must reflect the work of the Joint Committee on Drugs Use and be informed by service users and providers. While Sinn Féin will not oppose this motion, it is pre-emptive of the outcome of the work of the committee."

It is not like they are not human beings. Every one of them has a family, their own story and their own voice and we have to support them. One of the really important bits of work that was done in the committee in the last Dáil was that we heard from experts from Portugal, America and British Columbia. In British Columbia they were very forward-thinking in relation to decriminalisation, but after 15 months they had to row back because suddenly people were taking drugs in playgrounds, in parks and on the streets. There was a free-for-all. We need to get these experts in. I am thinking of the work that has been done in Portugal. Our joint committee on drugs can get all these experts in and come up with a plan. We can learn from what has been done in other jurisdictions - both the mistakes made and the good work done – and bring forward a policy.",

                "What underlies addiction is poverty, and a symptom of poverty is trauma and a symptom of trauma is addiction. It is a circle that keeps going around. I am from north Clondalkin. I grew up there in the eighties. It was a time of economic hardship across the country but areas like mine suffered the most. We grew up in poverty. This is not me standing up and saying \"poor me\", because when I say I grew up in poverty I did not know it because everybody around me was experiencing the same thing. We simply did not know any better. What we did know was not to ask our parents for too much because it simply was not there. North Clondalkin is an area of high disadvantage. I have seen the devastation drugs have inflicted in my area since I was a child. I live in the community still and I have seen the intergenerational addiction and trauma within families. This trauma, as I said, comes from poverty but also from parents of my friends being products of the industrial schools, the Magdalen laundries and the mother and baby homes. I can speak to this from personal experience because my father was sent to work in the Magdalen laundries at the age of 12. He is 72 now and is only starting to speak about it. This is the trauma people experienced and he knows I am speaking about this today. This trauma was unwittingly passed down by parents to the next generation.",
                "When I say \"area of high disadvantage\" I am speaking about the government policies of the time, like putting people from the same socioeconomic background into the same area at the same time without having the necessary infrastructure there. When I say we were disadvantaged and in poverty we were not in poverty because of a lack of character or of strength, because the people from my area – my parents, neighbours and friends – had to get out and fight for every single thing our area had, whether that is schools, something simple like buses, health centres and everything else. My very first interaction with activism was fighting for a school in my area. We were sent to a school that was deemed inappropriate for other pupils in a more affluent part of the constituency but it was okay for the students of Greenfort, Shancastle and Harelawn to attend that school. That is what you are being put against. You had to fight that all the time. A lot of my family, friends and neighbours succumbed to addiction over the years. That is just a simple fact of things. While you cannot physically change the environment you are living in people look for alternatives and one of the alternatives they had to was to look at drugs, because they give people the ability to self-soothe and give calm to an anxious inner world. It is called getting out of your head for a reason. If you cannot get out of your estate you can get out of your head in a different way without having to move. It stops a problem for that very short time and then that problem turns into addiction.",

I do not know how long we have been calling for multiannual funding for. It is so important because it would allow agencies that are dealing with the front line to forward plan to deal with things when they arrive at the door. We knew the crack cocaine problem was an issue long before it was being discussed in this House because the front-line services were seeing it, but they had not got the resources to go out and tackle it. We need multiannual funding. If I could get one thing out of today, it would be that."

It said Ireland must adopt a comprehensive health-led response to drug use, one that treats addiction and substance misuse not as a criminal issue or set of criminal issues but as a public health issue. We in Sinn Féin support recommendation 17 of the report, which calls for the introduction of a health-led approach to possession of drugs for personal use. This recommendation represents a major step forward in reforming how the State responds to drug use. It is rooted in compassion, is supported by evidence, is pragmatic and aligns with international best practice which, as Deputy Gould said, we must rely upon the mistakes and successes of.",

The focus of that committee is to implement the assembly’s findings, especially in relation to a health-led diversion approach. We are actively involved in supporting that process. We want to ensure Ireland moves away from criminalisation and punishment towards prevention, treatment and recovery. A health-led approach means while controlled drugs would remain illegal, people found in possession for personal use would be diverted into health services rather than the criminal justice system. The State would respond to drug use and misuse primarily as a public health issue and this model would ensure those struggling with addiction are met with support and opportunity, not the stigma and criminal records that can further entrench addiction, hamper recovery and have lifelong impacts for them. We also acknowledge the assembly left the detailed legislative and policy design to the Oireachtas, and that work is now under way through the re-established joint committee. I commend my party colleagues for their engagement on that and the leadership they are showing.",

It will take some work to design but it is work that is under way and needs to continue. To give credit where it is due, the assembly was a vital democratic process. That was very important and the findings bear that out. It brought together experts, families and service users to look at international best practice and to learn from it.",
                "Our policy position is clear. We support the de facto approach that has been referenced already. The offence of simple possession should remain in law, but we should have a much more pragmatic response where cautions and health interventions are the order of the day, rather than court appearances and convictions. The Garda caution scheme must be reviewed and modernised. Prison sentences for simple possession should remain technically possible, perhaps, but used only in the most exceptional of circumstances. It should not be the norm and our district courts should not be full to overflowing with these cases. Convictions for possession should be treated as spent and ultimately expunged. We do not need this following people around for the rest of their days. For those who repeatedly offend, dissuasive sanctions such as restorative justice, community service or diversion programmes are probably the most appropriate avenue. The courts – potentially specialist courts – and professional regulatory bodies should apply these sanctions fairly and proportionately. This is a really important debate. It is something that will continue to happen on Committee Stage but it is something we will need to return to in the House."

That is with all the really good work that has been done at times by the Garda and the Criminal Assets Bureau, and we need to see more of that.

I welcome the opportunity to speak on it today. The motion states that we recall the Citizens' Assembly on Drugs Use, the interim report of the Oireachtas Committee on Drugs Use and the Misuse of Drugs Act. All we are doing is recalling them, because all of these measures, debates and conversations have been had, but the same policies remain largely in place despite the evidence the various initiatives have brought forward. We are stuck remembering promises that have never yet become policy. While successive Governments have talked about a health-led approach, what they have actually been giving us is a criminal justice system pretending to be healthcare policy. Any day of the week at the Circuit Court, there are people facing charges and offences and, in the vast majority of cases, if we could back over that person's life, we would see substance misuse, trauma and a form of substance misuse that is about self-medicating for traumas that may go back generations in some part. Every single day in this country, people of all ages are stopped and searched, charged and shamed, often for having been caught with a small amount of drugs for personal. In reality, that should be a matter for a GP and not a garda.",
                "Since our inception, the Social Democrats have always been clear that if a Government truly believes in a health-led approach, then it is time to act like it. That absolutely starts with the repeal of section 3 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977. We cannot have a decriminalisation-lite model subsequent to winning the argument, hopefully, on decriminalisation. Decriminalisation actually means removing the criminal offence of possession for personal use. The citizens' assembly was clear on that, as was the previous Oireachtas committee on drug use. Everything else, the sale, supply, cultivation, manufacture, remains illegal. That is the distinction between decriminalisation and legalisation. Decriminalisation does not mean the free-for-all that some people fear, as has been expressed in the Chamber already. It does not mean drugs are sold in shops. It means people are not dragged through the courts or branded as criminals simply for struggling or making a personal choice that harms nobody else. I will talk at the end about the mechanisms we can put in place should we repeal section 3 of the Act. We have all heard the scare stories. We have been told decriminalisation will make things work, use will skyrocket, dealers will thrive, communities will become less safe. The evidence internationally tells a very different story. In Portugal, where they decriminalised over 20 years ago, injection-associated HIV infections have fallen, the number of people in prison for drug offences has dropped, drug-related deaths have declined and, crucially, drug use did not increase. That is because when we stop treating people like criminals, we create a space for them to be treated like human beings.",
                "I represent communities where drugs have done untold damage, families are devastated, people are living in fear of drug-related intimidation and organised crime feeds on poverty and despair. I understand why some people ask how this will make things better where they live. The answer is that criminalising the drug user has never made communities safer. It has not stopped dealers, dismantled networks or brought down levels of violence. All it has done is fill our courts, ruin young lives with criminal records and make recovery harder. When Portugal decriminalised, the police did not lose power, they refocused it. They shifted from arresting people with tiny amounts to targeting those higher up the chain. The weight of drugs seized actually increased. Far from helping dealers, decriminalisation takes away the smokescreen that lets them operate in plain sight. Some people say it is too complex to repeal section 3 but I would argue that is not the case. Section 3 is a stand-alone offence that can be repealed by a single Act of the Oireachtas. There is nothing complex about it except the political courage required to do it. In Oregon, for example, it was pointed out that after removing possession, drug use operated without sanction, which led to drug dealing and consumption in parks. That was their model, however; it does not have to be ours. If we were to repeal section 3 of the drugs offences Act, as expert testimony has indicated, we could and should replace it with council by-laws much as we have for alcohol. If somebody were to leave the Chamber now and buy a bottle of alcohol, the possession of that alcohol is not illegal. If they walked into St. Stephen's Green and opened the alcohol, it would be illegal under the council by-laws. If they consumed the alcohol and their behaviour became erratic, that would fall under the intoxication Act. We have mechanisms in our jurisdiction that would be suited to decriminalisation without the free-for-all that has been referred to. The removal of section 3 and innovative practices within the Irish model are there, have been argued for and would suit our Republic really well.",
                "Repealing section 3 would not legalise drugs. It would simply stop the State from wasting Garda and court time and prison resources chasing people for small amounts. Those resources could be redirected to addiction services, outreach, housing and harm reduction. That is what Portugal did. Multiple UN bodies have urged us to do this. It is what the Citizens' Assembly thought it was voting for, until a flawed process left decriminalisation off the ballot entirely. The chair of the assembly has been crystal clear. Members wanted decriminalisation and voted for decriminalisation. The only reason it did not appear that way on paper was how the question was written. We have an opportunity now to finish the job they started and to respect the democratic process that this Government says it values. That is why I will keep calling for the national drugs strategy to be designated as an interim strategy. The Committee on Drugs Use, of which I am incredibly proud to be the Cathaoirleach, is still doing the hard, detailed work of building a policy that reflects the evidence and the voices of people living in this reality every single day. To push ahead with a final strategy before that report is complete would be to bypass democracy entirely. We owe it to the people who have come before that committee - the experts, workers, families and most importantly the people with lived experience - to get this right. We must ensure that their voice, when they came to a committee established by this Government, is actually catered for in the work it charged the committee to do. It is essential that it is an interim strategy. We are clearly nowhere near where we should be.",
                "It took nearly a decade to open a single medically supervised injection centre - a decade. Now, almost a year after opening, we are seeing how effective it can be. In just seven months, it has taken thousands of injection events off the street, has saved lives and is preserving people's self-respect. In the absence of safe injection facilities, what we had for over 40 decades in this country was unsafe injection facilities in our laneways and parks. These have left the user incredibly unsafe but they also leave all of us unsafe. That is what a health-led response looks like in practice - not rhetoric, results. We should be scaling that up, not patting ourselves on the back for opening one facility a decade late.",
                "The criminalisation of people who use drugs is one of the greatest policy failures of modern Ireland. It wastes Garda time; fills our prisons with people who need healthcare, not punishment; stigmatises people who are already struggling; and traps them in cycles of poverty and exclusion. The evidence is overwhelming. Decriminalisation does not increase use, does not empower dealers and does not erode communities. What it does is save lives, restore dignity and bring honesty back into our drug policy.",
                "If the Government truly believes in a health-led response, it must prove it. For me, that starts with the repeal of section 3. It would designate the national drugs strategy as interim, listen to participants of the citizens' assembly, fund harm reduction services properly and most of all, bring the voices of people with lived experience into every decision we make. This is a really welcome debate and I am very interested in hearing the viewpoints of people across the Chamber. The work of the committee is ongoing. We are hearing some incredible stories that are empowering and heartbreaking. The stories we have been replicating for four decades of failed policy not only in this jurisdiction but elsewhere. At the end, we can have a document that contains evidence, reason and the heart of people who have given of their time to appear before the committee. I believe it should be respected. We need a new approach. Nobody is underestimating the task but every single day, lives are being eroded because of what is often the self-medication of trauma, poverty, harm and hurt. If we get this right, we can get it right for the next four to five decades. I thank the Labour Party for bringing forward this motion today. It is a really worthy discussion."

                "I thank the Labour Party for bringing forward this motion. Decriminalisation of all drugs has been the policy of People Before Profit for very many years. We were delighted to see that this was finally adopted as a consensus cross-party position in the interim report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Drugs Use, which was then chaired by Gino Kenny. The report was published last October. The interim report recommended that decriminalisation of possession for personal use should apply equally to all illicit drugs. Importantly, it also made clear that this should be done by repealing section 3 of the Misuse of Drugs Act. In other words, we should adopt a de jure as opposed to merely de facto approach to decriminalisation to ensure we have a consistent application of the health-led approach that everyone in this House pays lip service to. I am doubtful about their actual commitment to it. The benefit of that is to remove the risk of discriminatory discretion being given to An Garda Síochána in respect of whether it prosecutes marginalised individuals or not.",
                "That was the position. All the parties agreed to that position after discussion and after looking at the evidence. We then went into the general election where Fianna Fáil promised in its election manifesto to decriminalise drug possession for personal use, making no distinction between cannabis and other drugs, only to be then criticised by Fine Gael for effectively being soft on drugs, abandoning the position it had arrived at through a discussion based on evidence for cheap right-wing populism. Fine Gael said that it would continue to implement with An Garda Síochána a health-led approach for people in possession of drugs for personal use, criticising Fianna Fáil for its position on decriminalisation. Fianna Fáil then engaged in backsliding in the face of that criticism from Fine Gael, saying that when it wrote about decriminalising drug possession for personal use, it only meant decriminalisation of cannabis, which clearly makes no sense. It meant what it wrote, which was the agreed position of all the parties and is the evidence-based position, but backslid in the face of leaning into right-wing law-and-order populism by Fine Gael. There was backsliding in the general election that is reflected in the programme for Government, which makes no mention of decriminalisation and uses similar language to the Fine Gael manifesto saying it will commit to a health-led approach to drug addiction and divert those found in possession of drugs for personal use to health services.",
                "In every debate on drugs in which I have been involved over the past number of years here, we see the words \"health-led approach\". They say it every time they speak about it but with no real content because the language could mean decriminalisation or it could mean - I suspect it does mean - continuing with the flawed health diversion approach where drug users can be diverted to health services the first two times they are caught in possession of small amounts of drugs for personal use but after that, they are dealt with under section 3 of the Misuse of Drugs Act and condemned to be another victim of the failed war on drugs.",
                "\"Three strikes and you're out\" is a stupid approach to take to people suffering from drug addiction. The experience with addiction is that it can take far more than two or three attempts to get off drugs, particularly when addiction treatment and rehab services are so massively underfunded and massively oversubscribed that, in reality, they are non-existent for many people in addiction. It is why we have the highest levels of drug deaths in Europe - a disgraceful situation for one of the wealthiest countries in the EU. That is an expression of the scale of inequality in this country. It is also why more than than 70% of people in prison suffer from some form of drug addiction. That is at least 3,889 people out of a total prison population of 5,556. The entire repressive system of courts and prisons could be radically reduced if instead of criminalising people for their addictions and expanding the prison system like the Government is doing, it prioritised addiction prevention and treatment. It costs €99,000 to keep one person in prison for a year. That is €385 million per year that we are spending to keep people with addiction problems in prison. Imagine what a massive expansion that would be if we instead put that money into prevention, treatment and rehabilitation programmes and tackled the inequality, trauma and adverse childhood experiences that draw people into addiction in the first place. Instead, we have a situation where there are only 20 addiction counsellors working across the entire Irish Prison Service, with one addiction counsellor for every 277 prisoners, of whom about 200 are likely to be addicted to drugs. That means there is no chance of getting access to treatment if someone is serving a prison sentence of less than one year, which is the case for many prisoners on drug offences.",
                "I urge the Government to reconsider its backsliding on this vital issue. In the US, President Trump is relaunching the failed war on drugs but we do not have to follow him blindly over every cliff he goes over. The Government is backsliding as part of this rightward trend in politics in terms of military spending and abandoning climate targets. It must not do this with drugs policy as well. We should be going in the opposite direction - not just decriminalisation of drugs for personal use, which still leaves drug distribution and supply in the hands of criminal gangs, but full legalisation of them with State control and regulated distribution and supply. It is the only approach that would allow for Government regulation to ensure safety for users and eliminate profiteering on misery by either criminal gangs or private corporations.",
                "The committee's interim report also made proposals in that direction through a cross-party consensus recommendation that steps be taken to introduce a regulatory model for certain drugs with particular reference to the development of an Irish not-for-profit regulated cannabis market. The recommendation to develop not-for-profit cannabis clubs is a sensible idea that should be pursued by the Government.",
                "There are two aspects to a health-led approach to drugs, neither of which have been taken by the Government. One is to actually have decriminalisation or legislation, while the other is to invest in the health supports for people suffering from drug addiction, to whom the Government pays lip service. I had a Topical Issue earlier with the Minister of State on the funding of our local drug and alcohol task forces. The evidence is there.",
                "What is happening is a slow strangulation over the years of our task forces. When the rhetoric has shifted towards having a health-led approach, the Government has cut funding over the same period of time. Over the past ten years, while total funding for the health service has almost doubled, funding for local drugs and alcohol task forces has fallen by close to 5%. We had a back and forth earlier with the Minister of State about the impact of the latest budget on funding for the task forces. It seemed clear to me at the end of our discussion that the truth is that funding is being cut again. The task forces are the people who are doing the work on the front line. They are being asked to pay an extra 1.5% in the first year for auto-enrolment and no funding is provided for that. That is a cut in real terms. There is no ongoing core increase in funding to address the cost of living or the issue of inflation. That is a cut in a real sense. There was the presentation of the important DRIVE project. Earlier, the Minister of State talked positively about it and there is a website promoting it. It is vital that we assist families who are facing horrendous intimidation over drug debts. The Minister of State is going to come back to me, so I welcome that, yet in the budget fact sheet, there is no reference to any funding for it whatsoever. There is the announcement of a new project, for example in Whitechurch, in my constituency, where 75 families have been supported by WASP Ireland, from money that was accessed under the community safety and innovation fund, but that money is over. On 1 January, they will be asking if they will be able to support these families any more because no funding is provided under DRIVE. It is not just a question of funding, but that is kind of where the rubber hits the road.",
                "The Minister of State spoke earlier about how the task forces are an integral part and they will not be excluded and so on, but the bottom line point is that they are being excluded from the reference group to support the implementation of the new national drugs strategy. Again, the people who are on the front line in the communities most affected by drug addiction are being left out of the vital conversations on shaping the national drugs strategy. Unfortunately, none of this augurs well for an approach that takes the words \"health led\" seriously and actually follows that up with decriminalisation and funding for all of our drug services."

                "One of my first political experiences was canvassing in a block of flats in Dublin. As I walked up the stairwell in the block of flats, I noticed, first, a pair of women's tights on the stairwell. When I got higher, I noticed a discoloured spoon near the top of the stairwell and when I got to the very top, there was a 17-year-old boy lying on the ground, practically unconscious, foaming at the mouth. We did our best to try to help him. It was clear that he had taken heroin and was suffering as a result. A few minutes later, a young boy in a Christian Brothers school uniform walked around the corner and stepped over him like it was nothing. It was very clear to me that unless there was some kind of intervention in this area, in these families, the seven-year-old boy would be in the same position as the 17-year-old boy in a number of years.",
                "There are two major problems with that. First, if there is no intervention on a human level, these individuals are being left to an horrendous life of ill health, addiction and likely death as well. Even if you did not give a damn about the human aspect of this, there is a societal problem too. The sale and supply of these drugs is ravaging whole sections of Irish society with deaths and of people spending decades in prisons as well. There is a real need for the State to actually get serious about drugs. It is not serious about drugs at all. To a certain extent, if many of these individuals in such situations were from the leafy suburbs, it would be an issue of far more importance here in Leinster House. Any drugs policy needs to have as its objective the reduction of harm. That has to be the absolute objective in relation to any issue on an individual basis and on a societal basis as well. Drugs cause harm. The consumption of drugs leads to significant harm, even if there is no criminality involved. Even the consumption of cannabis leads to significant mental health issues. It leads to psychosis and schizophrenia and it can lead to significant physical health problems as well, never mind other drugs. The objective of any policy has to include the reduction of the use of drugs. It is often said in this House that there is a dichotomy and that it is either a health-led issue or a criminal approach and that is not the truth. We could actually have both running in tandem. There is no real health-led element in this Government. In my own constituency, there are no residential rehabilitation beds for young people who want to get off drugs. A 17-year-old kid in my county at the moment who is addicted to drugs and actually wants to get off them has no real help whatsoever.",
                "I have heard other people say that there is evidence in certain areas that the decriminalisation of drugs can lead to increased use, increased damage to health and increased overdoses, as has happened in certain jurisdictions. It is easier for parents to warn their kids off the consumption of drugs by telling them that it is illegal rather than just harmful. The use of illegal drugs on a regular basis is at about 10% within society at the moment, which is far lower than drugs that are completely legal, such as alcohol. It strikes me as strange that we are having a big discussion about the potential decriminalisation of, I think, nearly all drugs at this stage, and at the same time trying to reduce access to cigarettes and vapes, knowing that even these could create difficulty for individuals' health. Our party would not be in support of the decriminalisation of drugs. We believe that the Government actually has a bigger job in making sure that the law is implemented. We have no ships to patrol the seas to check the people who are bringing drugs in on the seas to this country. There are 53 Garda stations in Ireland with no gardaí assigned to them. In any block of apartments in any area where kids are taking drugs on a regular basis, the Garda is not touching that because it simply does not have the resources to do so."

                "Nobody wants to see people with addiction punished while the dealers get rich. In Limerick, Sr. Concilio in Cuan Mhuire has done an amazing job trying to help people with addiction. The centre has opened a farm and a garden centre to reintroduce people into the workplace. She has done brilliant work. A former hurler from Limerick, Ciaran Carey, has counselling services doing the same, using people who have suffered from addictions themselves, because they know what they talking about. We see people doing all this great work and then we are talking about punishing people who have addictions and we are letting the dealers go free. They go free because they are able to get the drugs into this country, the same way as food can be imported. There is nothing stopping them coming in. We need to try something different. I believe Portugal has tried something slightly different. There, certain drugs have been legalised in a controlled way. Here, it was shown that people who were suffering from serious illnesses could be helped by medicinal cannabis after every other drug had been tried. In some cases, the only thing that actually worked was medicinal cannabis to give that person a quality of life. Under tight legislation and under tight laws, I would like to see those people have a quality of life if that is the only quality of life that is there, if the other drugs are not there to help them. We have legalised drugs in this country through our chemists and others, which are prescribed drugs for people. If none of them works and the medicinal cannabis does work for people to give them a quality of life, I would be for that, as long as it is legislated for tightly and controlled. We should look at the Portugese model. If we take control away from the dealers, we might actually halve the problem. Something has to be done differently. All we are doing at the moment is punishing people who are addicted. Recently, Deputy Conor Sheehan said that Limerick was the cocaine capital of Ireland. It is not."

                "Deputy O'Donoghue mentioned medicinal cannabis a while ago. I note the journey that one individual had to go to get medicinal cannabis to save her child's life. Today, I wish to acknowledge the extraordinary journey of Vera Twomey, a mother whose courage and determination have left a lasting mark on Ireland's healthcare landscape. Her daughter, Ava Barry, suffered from Dravet Syndrome, a rare and devastating form of epilepsy that caused her to ensure up to 20 seizures a day. Traditional medications failed to ease Ava's suffering and Vera was left with no choice but to seek alternative treatment. That treatment, medicinal cannabis, was not legally accessible in Ireland at that time so Vera did what no parent should ever have to do; she uprooted her family and moved abroad to the Netherlands, where Ava could receive the care she needed. This was not a decision made lightly. It was a desperate act of love driven by the need to save her child's life and it worked. Ava's seizures dropped dramatically and her quality of life improved in ways that conventional medicine had never achieved. Vera did not stop there. She walked literally from Cork to Leinster House twice to demand change. Her campaign was not only for Ava, but for every family facing similar struggles. Eventually, Ava was granted a special licence to access medicinal cannabis in Ireland, a breakthrough that came only after immense public pressure and personal sacrifice. Tragically, Ava passed away in 2023, but her legacy lives on. The inquest into her death led to the recommendation of Ava's protocol, a proposed national framework to guide the safe and compassionate use of unlicensed medicines, including medicinal cannabis. This protocol is a vital step towards ensuring that no other family has to fight so hard for care that should be accessible. Today, I call on every Member to support Ava's protocol and help make it national policy. Vera Twomey's fight was for her daughter but her impact reaches far beyond one family. As I said, I am conscious of the difficulty we had at the time to get that message across to the Government that there are medicines, in this case, cannabis, that could help somebody. If there is a drug out there that will help somebody's health, we should be there willing to help that, but decriminalisation is an area where we are going down a dangerous route on other drugs."

                "Deputy Kenny's contribution earlier was important because he talked about going on a journey. There are lots of people that we need to expose to the medical evidence. We need to expose them to the work of the citizens' assembly and the Oireachtas joint committee. There is a huge body of work. Deputy O'Donoghue's contribution was important as well. We can have a law-and-order approach on this and a compassionate health-led and, I believe, decriminalised approach to the possession of personal drugs because the people who are the problem here are those who are trafficking, selling and manufacturing large quantities of drugs, making millions of euro out of it and exploiting people with an addiction.",
                "Something I thought most informative from the Oireachtas joint committee hearings was the Portuguese police contribution stating that more of their time was now available to tackle the drug gangs and the people selling drugs in large numbers as a result of not prosecuting small personal possession. The Minister of State mentioned the Department's position on this and in some ways, I wish the joint committee engagement had happened in advance of this debate. We can tease things out at the committee.",
                "Paul Reid clearly said that the citizens' assembly was clear it wished to remove the possession of drugs from the criminal justice system. The difficulty with not removing the criminal sanction is that if we leave any element of discretion under that principle, we will leave ourselves in a difficult position and we will not move forward on it. If, for example, we give gardaí the ability to have discretion as to whether some type of people would be prosecuted or other types of people would not, we would put an unfairness and an injustice at the heart of our drugs policy. We should have an approach were we decriminalise the person and not legalise the substance and if we did that, we would be able to progress a strong health-led approach. I welcome the wording in the programme for Government, which was also welcome by CityWide, the respected organisation, but there is an expectation that we do exactly what Paul Reid said and remove the criminal justice system from the possession of drugs.",
                "Whatever system comes forward on that, we cannot leave any type of discretion with individual gardaí. The reason I say so is that while we could say, \"Surely you would leave that to the discretion of the local gardaí\", drugs policy will be policed differently in different communities . In some areas, gardaí might penalise people who are sleeping homeless. They might decide that they are going to penalise working communities that have high levels of drug sales when there might be the same level of drug use in middle-class communities. We cannot leave an element of discretion in the law. We would not do it in other areas. I have seen it compared, for example, with the decriminalisation of sex workers where we put the criminal sanction on the person procuring the service, not the person selling it. Let us imagine we had said, \"but we will leave a discretion so that the person who was selling the service might be prosecuted\". It would not work. If we believe that vulnerable person has an addiction, we should not have the criminal justice system involved in that; we should only have health-led approaches. I urge the Minister of State to examine that section as she goes before the Oireachtas joint committee to examine and tease out all of the provisions.",
                "The joint committee made clear that it wanted to repeal section 3 but it must be replaced. Members were also clear on the point about removing the criminal justice system from possession itself. The key people that we have to target are those who are selling drugs and who are exploiting people who have experienced trauma or living in poverty or who perhaps tried this on a recreational basis and became addicted because of other factors.",
                "Deputy Tóibín stated that it makes it easier for parents to dissuade people from drugs use by it being illegal. If the Deputy were correct, we would not have the drugs problem we have at present."

                "In the meantime, drug use has been exploding. In 2024, the Health Research Board reported that cocaine accounted for 40% of all treatment cases. We are also seeing a dangerous increase in potency and synthetics. Going back to cannabis, the cannabis currently on the streets has a synthetic cannabinoid sprayed on it. Natural cannabis is not physically addictive but when synthetic cannabinoids, which are generated and sprayed by drug dealers, are used, it makes the stock they are giving to young teenagers physically addictive. Not only that, it is completely frying their brains. People are getting schizophrenia and psychosis, which is really bad. If we could look into what other countries, such as Canada and the Netherlands, have done, and look into reducing the amount and making it a regulated system, it would be very much better for young children and anyone going into it. It would bring them out of criminal connections. That is something we need to look at.",

It is not just about statements. There is clear evidence that decriminalisation does not lead to a surge in drug use. In the years that followed Portugal's change, the use of most substances fell below the original levels in 2001. What changed was the stigma around it, the access to care, and people stopped dying alone. I have always used this analogy about the homeless crisis when I worked for Peter McVerry, but it goes hand in hand with drug use; if you see people floating down a river, you eventually stop just pulling them out of the river. You go to the top of the river to see why they are getting in there in the first place, to prevent them falling into homelessness and drug us, and to give them that support at the start of their lives. That is something I really support.",

The development of the successor strategy is informed by an evaluation of the current strategy and consultation with stakeholders. In addition, we will take into account the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on Drugs Use, which many have referenced today, the interim report of the Joint Committee on Drugs Use, the programme for Government and the EU drugs strategy.",

During this evaluation, 68 stakeholders participated in consultation sessions and additional written submissions were received. This inclusive process aimed to capture a broad spectrum of perspectives, including those of service providers, statutory bodies, civil society organisations and individuals with lived experience. The independent evaluation assessed the strategy on four areas; impact, governance, performance and coherence with international policies. I note the opportunities and challenges outlined in the report's findings.",
                "The national drugs strategy has made progress in advancing a health-led approach, particularly through the expansion of harm reduction initiatives, such as naloxone distribution and drug checking services. The evaluation identified a number of positive findings including: the introduction of strategic implementation groups; strengthened interagency collaboration at local level; and improved data collection and monitoring, which enables sight of the changing profile of drug users and how prevalent cocaine use has become in Irish society. The strategy is well aligned with international frameworks, particularly the EU drugs strategy.",
                "The independent evaluation also notes some challenges, including delivery of prevention and early intervention initiatives and the need for alternatives to coercive sanctions. The report presents ten strategic recommendations for the development of an integrated, equitable and outcome-focused strategy. These include the right to help for people who use drugs; providing culturally sensitive and appropriate services for all groups; equitable access to services; and strengthened prevention in early intervention initiatives. These will now be incorporated into the new strategy. To further inform the development of the next strategy, the Department held a number of in-person consultations with key stakeholders. Over 240 people attended the consultation. They included representatives of drugs and alcohol task forces from across the country, drugs service providers and civil society organisations. The consultation report has been published and circulated to the Joint Committee on Drugs Use.",
                "The Citizens' Assembly on Drugs Use recognised the value of listening to the citizens of Ireland in relation to our approach to the issue of drugs. The Government has committed to responding to the recommendations of the assembly. The Department of Health has engaged with all relevant Departments to develop a considered response to each of the recommendations, which will in turn be incorporated into the successor national drugs strategy. At the high-level segment of the sixty-seventh session of the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs, the Government submitted a Pledge4Action by stating: \"The Irish Government commits to carefully consider and respond with urgency to the assembly’s recommendations for reform of the legislative, policy and operational approach to drug use, and to indicate the timeframe for implementing those recommendations which it accepts.\"",
                "We cannot underestimate the importance of prevention and education in tackling drug use. A wealth of international evidence shows us that by investing in evidence-based drug prevention interventions, we can reduce the negative impact of drug use for the person and their families and communities. The Department of Health has made significant strides regarding its approach to drug prevention. In 2023, a funding scheme totalling €1.5 million was awarded to five projects to implement a range of evidence-based drug prevention interventions across the country. In line with the citizens' assembly, the Department of Health is currently working with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime to implement its review of prevention systems project to assess our national approach to drug prevention. We have rolled out training developed by the European Union Drugs Agency and effective approaches to drug prevention to over 50 people.",
                "Drug-related intimidation is a serious and insidious issue impacting individuals, families and communities nationwide. It is a complex problem that manifests differently across regions, often leaving victims fearful and powerless. Intimidation can involve demands for repayment of perceived drug debts or opportunistic extortion. Its relentless natures poses a significant risk to health and well-being. In May, the Minister of State for the national drugs strategy and the Minister for justice launched a major awareness campaign to reduce the stigma surrounding drug-related intimidation and violence by promoting the range of supports available to those affected. The DRIVE project, which is supported by the Departments of Health and justice, An Garda Síochána and many other stakeholders, aims to build community capacity to support victims and tackle the root causes of intimidation and violence. DRIVE reflects the partnership approach at the heart of the national drugs strategy and aligns with the recommendations from the citizens' assembly.",

The Garda National Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau has seized over €627 million in illicit drugs and made over 1,700 arrests for drug trafficking, money laundering, possession of firearms and other offences since its establishment ten years ago. Last year, the Criminal Justice (Engagement of Children in Criminal Activity) Bill was enacted. This legislation criminalises adults who either force or encourage children to engage in any criminal activity, recognising the lifelong impact on a child of involvement in criminal activity.",

This process is supported by a reference group comprising service providers and individuals with lived experiences. A draft strategy is expected to be submitted to Minister of State responsible for drugs strategy by December. It is intended that the successor national drug strategy along with a two-year action plan will be published in 2026 with a subsequent action plan envisaged for 2028-2029."

Ms Christine Kavanagh is a mother from Cork who has lost three sons to drug overdoses. A number of months ago I watched her interview on RTÉ and her deep emotion struck many people across the country. Christine lost her three sons, Dillon, Damien and Leon, to drug overdoses. Christine outlined that more services need to be offered to help people with addiction and mental health. I will just read some of what Christine said, \"Mental health always comes with addiction... I just feel there’s nothing being done for people with addiction and mental health [issues]\". On a supervised injecting centre for Cork, Christine said, \"My two children might have been saved if they were inside in a centre.\" This story gripped many people's attention - a mother who had been through what no mother should have had to go through, calling for increased supports, a reform of our drug policy and a drug-injecting facility for Cork. That is exactly what I am calling for here. Along with this, a key recommendation of the Citizens' Assembly on Drug Use was a greater focus on prevention and recovery, and greater supports for family and children impacted by drug use.",

I see the amazing work being done in these facilities. However, if a family cannot cope with the exorbitant figure to enter this facility, the individual must wait up to eight months in some instances to be referred by the HSE. I know of a treatment centre in Cork that my brother went to. Some weeks, it only has ten recovering patients because people cannot afford to get in and for those who are waiting to get in, when the time comes around for them to take a place in the recovery programme, they do not want to help anymore. When a person makes a decision to seek help, they need it there and then. They have had a realisation that they want a better life. We should not be placing them on a waiting list because of the affordability of services.",

She now believes it split 50:50 between drug addiction and housing needs. We make it unequivocally clear that those who sell and distribute drugs should be treated as the criminals they are. They are making easy money off vulnerable people. Based on what some in this House say on this motion, the phrase \"running with the hare and hunting with the hounds\" is quite appropriate. Some people have offered sympathy and empathy to some families, but along with that they are not man enough to stand up and have a real debate on how we must be progressive on our drug policy and absolutely take a health-led approach to drug users."

It is important that these task forces and the projects they are involved in continue to get the funding they need over the coming years.",

At its heart this is a motion about people, vulnerable people, marginalised people and people who are sick, and the value we place on their lives or more accurately the lack of value because if we truly valued the lives of people suffering from addiction, we would have changed our approach long ago. Dealing with the issue of addiction and drugs solely through the criminal justice system has not worked. I do not think anyone in this House would argue with that. I suppose it could depend on a person's views of the outcomes we hope to achieve in our response to drug use and addiction, but our criminal justice approach has been indicative of a State and, if we are honest, a society that for a long time would prefer not to acknowledge the dignity and the humanity of those who have unfortunately found themselves dependent on drugs. It has allowed us to brush the issue under the rug and forget about them.",
                "However, drug use is so prevalent now that it has become difficult for people to ignore. It is in every town and village across the country, as we have heard. It is in every community, every workplace, every family and every club. To criminalise drug use is to completely misunderstand the nature of addiction. Of course, we can slap someone who is suffering from addiction with a charge or a custodial sentence and pretend that will solve a problem; it simply will not. Drug use is just not a choice for people who are suffering from addiction and punishing them for their addiction is absolutely not going to deter them; on the contrary all it does is push them further and further to the margins. That marginalisation, particularly among neglected communities and which is often multigenerational, is very often what fuels drug use in the first place. We need a genuine health-led approach, one that prioritises harm reduction and recovery, and supports people out of addiction.",

                "How many Dáil statements did we have for the victims of road deaths last year? We had three, and rightly so. How many did we have for those poor people who lost their lives to drug-induced poisoning? We had none. That shows where this Government’s priorities are in terms of tackling deaths and addiction by drug use. It has to change. We have offered the Government a motion multiple times. It should please follow through and deliver for people suffering from addiction."

                "I welcome an Teachta Boyd Barrett back to the House. His return is great news.",
                "Workers and families in this State are under savage pressure. They are being hit from every direction: soaring rents, sky-high energy bills, rip-off groceries, childcare that costs more than a mortgage, and insurance premiums that are through the roof. Yesterday’s Future Forty report from the Department of Finance clearly sets out how housing costs have skyrocketed in line with a cost of living that has spun out of control. Everywhere people turn, there is another bill, another squeeze, another hit. Now, as we head into Christmas, what does the Government do? It hikes up the local property tax. In the middle of a cost-of-living crisis, when people are counting every euro and every cent, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael decide to take more. This is a tax on the family home. It is not a tax on wealth or greed; it is a tax on ordinary people, including workers, pensioners and families, who are doing their best to get by. This one is on the Government, including the Minister for Finance, because it changed the law. The Minister widened the bands by just 20%, even though he knows house prices have shot up by 30% to 40% across most of the State. That is what is driving families into higher bands and costing them hundreds of euro.",
                "The reality on the ground makes an absolute mockery of the claim of the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, that only 5% of households would be affected by the band changes. Families in Waterford, Cork, Dublin, Louth and elsewhere all over the State are getting revaluation notices that claim otherwise. They feel angry, let down and tired of being bled dry. It is clear that the Minister's figure is not just wrong; it is wildly wrong. The number of households hit will be far higher than the Minister for Finance says, and his attempt to say otherwise is to take people for fools. They are not having it, because right now those same families are sitting at kitchen tables asking which bill to skip this month, be it the electricity bill, the rent or the groceries bill. The Minister came along and hiked up the local property tax. No sooner was the ink dry on a budget that left workers high and dry than the Government was back again heaping more pressure on struggling families. It handed out massive tax cuts and breaks to developers, banks and landlords and it gave nothing to ordinary workers to help them to make ends meet. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, as always, found room for the vested interests but not for the people who keep this country running. The Government had choices, of course, but it made all the wrong ones. It scrapped the energy credits that helped families to heat their homes; it raised student fees, making it harder for young people to stay in education; it hiked petrol and diesel, driving up the cost of getting to work or bringing kids to school; and it increased tolls, punishing commuters. Now, on top of all that, it hikes up the local property tax. That is not leadership; that is putting the wealthy and the golden circles first. The Minister for public expenditure can spin it whatever way he likes, and so can the Minister for Finance, but when these bills land through the door, people will see clearly that, again, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil are taking more from those who have least. The Government is taxing the family home when families are deciding which bill to skip. It is wrong, it is unjust, and it has to stop.",
                "People have had enough of a Government that says one thing and does the opposite, and talks about helping families but quietly signs off on measures that hike up charges. It had a choice between standing with workers and households and squeezing them further. It chose to squeeze them further. The Minister and I know it does not have to be this way. He does not have to increase the local property tax. No parent, pensioner or worker should have to pay more on their family home. I am asking the Minister to do the right thing: stop these hikes and stop hammering working families."

It is great to have you back. You are certainly back in action, and I look forward to our engagement later on today.",
                "On the local property tax, it is important to speak first about the Future Forty report, which sets out the wider economic and fiscal scenarios and the broader risks and megatrends that could crystallise over the coming decades. We know demographics are changing. Deputy Cullinane’s party leader, Deputy Mary Lou McDonald, previously said that demographics will look after themselves, which shows the short-termist approach of their party when it comes to economic management and its inability to see the strategic long-term risks in our economy.",
                "As we see from alternative budget scenarios, the Opposition wants to abolish the property tax, narrow our overall position on taxation and increase expenditure. This presents serious risks for our economy. The local property tax is a key source of funding for many local authorities across our country. It pays for services and amenities in each local area. It is a progressive tax linked directly to the value of properties. Higher-value properties are subject to a higher tax. By law, the local property tax is revalued every five years. There is ongoing work in the context of the local property tax changes from 2026 to 2030.",
                "It is important that we have a broad-based taxation system as we plan for dealing with the long-term effects on the economy. All Deputy Cullinane has given is a platitude of negativity and attacks against the Government, but very little in terms of solutions as to how his party plans to pay for what must be paid for in the medium to long term. Sinn Féin must be honest about how it would manage the economy and pay for all the commitments and promises it is making across nearly every area of government. Its statements are not credible and that is why the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, made changes in the context of the local property tax, including the widening of the bands. In the absence of any change to valuation bands or rates, there would have been a much bigger increase in the overall local property tax.",
                "That is why a significant number of homeowners will remain in their present bands for 2026 to 2030. The new annual charge for many households could be between €5 and €25 higher. We know there is discretion at local authority level to reduce or amend the local property tax depending on the decision of each local authority. That is why there has been significant work by the Department of Finance in terms of how it manages this self-assessed tax. The bands have been broadened and the Government did take measures in the budget to protect working families. The social protection budget, which the Sinn Féin leader dismissed yesterday, is €2 billion. The Deputy says it is insignificant. It is a significant, progressive and targeted intervention for those most in need in our society.",
                "It is not credible to attack every area of taxation and then to attack every area of expenditure for it not being enough. Sinn Féin's position on the economy would seriously undermine the foundations of our State and undermine the future. We all need to be honest-----"

                "I acknowledge the wonderful electoral victories against Trump in the US overnight. The stunning win by Zohran Mamdani in New York, in particular, proves that voters want a message of hope. That takes me neatly on to my question. Yesterday, the Government published Future Forty, a long-term economic assessment of Ireland’s outlook conducted by the Department of Finance. It projects that the housing disaster will continue for at least another 15 to 20 years, which is a truly grim analysis for every generation in this State. The report also issues a stark warning about the high cost to us all due to the Government’s failure to invest in climate action measures. The Tánaiste might like to take particular note of the report’s finding that “continued inward migration will be vital to maintain growth in the labour force.” So much for his outrageous dog whistle comment last week that there are too many people coming here. As I pointed out to the Minister yesterday, this report confirms that we need people to come here to share their skills with us to run our schools, cafés, crèches, care homes and hospitals and to build the homes we need.",
                "The report also tells us that the window of opportunity is closing when it comes to investing in infrastructure. My message to the Minister today is this: it would be utterly bizarre and, indeed, irresponsible for the Government to take as inevitable the projection that the housing crisis will continue for another decade or more. Regrettably, the Government has taken this bizarre approach for some time because in the face of successive damning reports about the lack of public investment by the Government, it has acted as if it has no power to change outcomes. The Minister and his Cabinet colleagues are not bystanders. They need to let go of neoliberal ideology, step up and show some ambition and urgency. As the Government’s own Housing Commission recommended, a radical reset of housing policy is needed and the Government needs to accept that we can fix things with political action. This is message is coming not just from those of us on the left, like Mamdani, but also from people like Stripe’s John Collison who asked at the weekend, “Why can’t Ireland just do things? It’s not for want of money.” I do not agree with all of his points, but he is right to say that Ministers have more powers to change things than they actually use. So, why does the Minister not step up?",
                "In the Government’s recent budget, it could have taken on the constructive proposals that we in the Labour Party put forward to ensure investment in affordable homes and decent public services. Instead, it chose to reward burger barons and big builders. It chose to make an evidence-free VAT cut, costing €681 million per year, and not to invest in tackling the housing crisis or the crisis in healthcare and childcare. Yesterday’s report should increase the Government’s ambition, not temper its expectations. Will the Government now correct its course and deliver a truly ambitious plan to build homes and adopt that radical reset on housing?"

We have a new housing plan being published in the coming weeks. We will have significant infrastructure reforms being published in the coming weeks, all to enable greater delivery of more homes and more infrastructure right across our economy. That is why it is important that we have that broad examination of the various economic and fiscal scenarios. It helps to set out the broader choices that we have as a Government and, indeed, as an Oireachtas around the risks which will crystalise. We know the trends on deglobalisation and how they will impact our wider long-term economic growth. We know the impacts when it comes to digitalisation and also the upside of that, if we can embrace that in the public service and also across all elements of the economy.",

Too many world leaders either do not recognise this threat or refuse to take it seriously. We know that 1.5°C of warming will have unthinkable consequences.

The world will become an even more unstable and dangerous place.",

However, this comes with a broad acceptance that 2030 targets will be missed by a country mile. That is the stark difference between climate rhetoric and climate action and it is something the Government is guilty of too. The Government said it would reduce emissions by 51% by 2030. Then, incredibly, it put forward measures that could at best add up to a reduction of only 23%. Shamefully, zero offshore wind is being generated, with none likely in 2030 either. Our waterways are choked with pollution, primarily from agriculture run-off and wastewater. None of us has to look very far to see the impact of the climate crisis.",

There are similar people providing cancer services right across the country. They asked me to raise particular issues about the need to properly resource and support cancer services in this country. It is important to say that everybody has a stake in that happening. I did not know this, but 50% of people will have an encounter with cancer during their lives. Some 44,000 people this year will get a cancer diagnosis. The Irish Cancer Society made a whole series of requests pre-budget. It is still not clear whether any of those have been met to fully fund and resource the national cancer strategy.",

They, as well as the staff, infrastructure and so on, have given me my life back. Some 50% of those people who get a cancer diagnosis each year, which is a very high figure, will need these machines. Fairly incredibly, 35% of those machines, which are supposed to be replaced every ten years, are now 15 to 17 years old. Some 40% will need to be replaced in the next five years. This means there is a lot of discomfort and stress for patients and staff who need this lifesaving treatment. What the people who work in radiation oncology are asking for, and they have asked repeatedly for this, is a national radiotherapy replacement programme where there is centralised oversight and procurement and ring-fenced multiannual funding, going forward, so they do not have to come each year with a begging bowl for money to provide this absolutely vital machinery to save lives."

It is important just to take a step back and look at the progress we have made over many years since the national cancer strategy was introduced. Over 65% of patients live for five years after a cancer diagnosis, compared with 43% in the 1990s. A lot of the difficult reforms that were introduced by Ministers in previous years around the centralisation of particular services and hubs have yielded much greater outcomes for citizens across the country. Like the Deputy, I commend all the workers across our hospital system who provide that daily care, compassion and support for people as they go through their treatment journey.",

That is why in the past five years we have nearly 30,000 additional healthcare workers in terms of whole-time equivalents working in our public health system to support and rapidly respond to diagnoses or particular incidents as they arise from cancer and a lot of other health perspectives. Next year, we will have an allocation of over €27 billion in terms of the overall allocation to the Department of Health.",
                "The Deputy asked specifically about radiation oncology, which I will respond to. In my negotiations and engagement with the Minister, Deputy Carroll MacNeill, we will have over €9 billion of capital in our health system over the next five years. That is a record level. The Minister is now developing a sectoral investment plan, working with the HSE on the capital needs in our system. Some of that will relate to radiation oncology or treatment interventions around replacing existing equipment. Others will obviously relate to new beds and building bed capacity across our system. As a Government, we have prioritised funding our health system, funding more workers and beds in our health system and also funding the technological improvements that I think will yield greater improvements in life expectancy. That is why we are taking digital health seriously and prioritising that from a capital perspective over the next five years. I will ask the Minister to respond in time to the Deputy's specific question and take a note of the work that is happening and the capital plans for the next five years. However, successive Governments have resourced and significantly reformed our health system and its cancer treatment. We are seeing the positive outputs from that due to the great work of the people the Deputy mentioned."

Some €23 million per year is being spent on outsourcing to the private sector because of machines breaking down and not being replaced, and because of the lack of a national replacement programme. As I said, doctors who should be providing services and care to patients are instead, in their own words, coming to the Minister, the Government and Departments begging for money, resources and so on to replace the machines they need to provide the care to save lives. The Minister needs to respond to the specific request to have a national programme for the replacement of these machines and to have the staff and infrastructure necessary to deliver it."

It is important, when we talk about the national cancer strategy, to note it is a strategy that has worked. It is delivering improved outcomes. Looking at the data over two to three decades, we have had a transformational improvement in that area over the last number of years. I will ask the Minister, Deputy Carroll MacNeill, to respond to the Deputy's specific question about radiation oncology.

I would like to raise the status of the long-promised primary healthcare centre for Loughlinstown and the surrounding communities. The HSE confirmed earlier this year that the operational lease process for the new Loughlinstown primary care centre collapsed when the preferred operator withdrew for viability reasons. The HSE advised it is now carrying out a service-led review before deciding on the next steps. I fully accept the HSE must ensure value for money and that projects are deliverable. However, it is vital this review does not quietly become a vehicle to move the primary care centre out of Loughlinstown and into Cherrywood or elsewhere.",
                "Loughlinstown, Ballybrack and the wider area have some of the highest levels of disadvantage in my constituency. It is also an area with a significantly older population, with the Dún Laoghaire, Dalkey and Loughlinstown community healthcare network recording 20% of residents to be aged over 65 compared with 15% nationally. They are precisely the communities that most depend on accessible, local primary care. Cherrywood, by contrast, is a new strategic development zone built from a new urban centre with plans for more than 10,000 homes and a projected population of roughly 26,000 people, orientated towards younger working households, well served by the Luas and the new town centre facilities. Cherrywood, rightly, will need services of its own but they should be additional to, not a replacement for, the long-promised upgrade of the primary healthcare centre in Loughlinstown. There is already a HSE health centre and primary care team in Loughlinstown delivering valuable services on the ground today.",
                "The purpose of this project is to modernise and expand those services on or adjacent to the existing site and not to relocate them elsewhere from people with the greatest need. I ask the Minister, on behalf of the Taoiseach, for whom he is taking questions today, to reaffirm the Government's commitment to delivering a new primary care centre in Loughlinstown, serving Loughlinstown, Ballybrack, Shankill, Shanganagh and the surrounding estates, and to confirm that the current HSE service-led plan will explicitly take into account the deprivation and age profile in deciding its location so we do not see a shift of resources from an older, lower income community to a more affluent, younger one."

As I mentioned previously, over the next five years, there will be an overall capital budget of over €9 billion. I think we will see a significant acceleration of investment in primary and community care right across our country. All of that is to manage the broader risks we have on demographics, ensure we can treat more people in the community, anchor more primary healthcare workers and embed more healthcare professionals in the community. That is the work that is ongoing in terms of the regional health areas.",
                "A central objective in the programme for Government is to deliver increased levels of integrated healthcare and that is towards general practice, primary care and having a home first approach, as I have referenced. Integral to this is the development of primary care centres across the country, in local communities such as Loughlinstown and in the Deputy's own community. They form a critical part of our healthcare infrastructure, providing a single point of access to primary and community care services for individuals. Progress has been made during the past number years. One hundred and eighty primary care centres have opened across the country and a further seven are under construction.",
                "Related to the Deputy's specific question, the HSE has confirmed the proposed delivery mechanism for a primary care centre in the instance he referenced was through the HSE primary care operational lease model. A tender process was undertaken and a preferred operator was selected. The HSE further advised that, unfortunately, the selected preferred operator then encountered difficulties in relation to the economic viability of the proposed project, which resulted in the collapse of that process. The HSE has confirmed that a service-led review is under way and that is to validate some of the questions the Deputy referenced. He spoke to the importance of age demographics being critical to managing the broader trends we see in communities across our country. There is also deprivation and we know education and healthcare are critical to enabling opportunities for people and also to mitigating a lot of the risks of intergenerational poverty. That is why deprivation should be a critical focus in the wider deployment of this capital funding.",

I understand it has planning permission, or did at one stage, and it beggars belief how long this has taken to redesign and redevelop the existing site where primary care is being administered at the moment. There is genuine concern locally that as Cherrywood continues to grow and attract investment, there will be pressure to rationalise, as was mentioned in the reply from the HSE, by shifting the new primary care centre there instead. It might look more efficient on a map or on a desktop but it ignores the original objective of that project that was conceived to serve an older and less well-off community. The demographics illustrate that, even in the HSE's original documentation.",

Ministers adopted a legally binding target for cutting emissions by 85% by 2040. On paper and in principle, it is positive to see this agreement reached, but the deal also mandates that another 5% reduction be achieved by outsourcing pollution cuts abroad through the purchase of international carbon credits. That get-out clause suggests that EU states will continue to believe that we can buy our way out of climate change and outsource our obligations to countries that have less. This is not so positive, especially as we are still miles off our target of a 51% reduction by 2030. In that context, will the Minister to commit Ireland to being a climate leader within the EU?

We need a statutory instrument to get around this. The law needs to be changed but they do not have time to wait for that .

This has led to the closure of the local school and créche. Families with small babies have moved out of the community when the water supply has broken, leaving people very stressed. One section of pipe needs immediate replacement from the source along the Healy Pass. The local community has set up the Adrigole Water Action Group, which has pleaded with me to get the powers that be to change the pipe, even with a temporary pipe. If repair crews have been kept out for 14 days since July this year, what cost is that to the State instead of replacing the section of piping immediately? This is also happening in Beach, Bantry, where the water supply has broken down 65 times over two years. The people of Adrigole are rightly frustrated. They know that if this was happening in Dublin, it would be replaced within hours. Why are they being treated like second-class citizens? Can the Minister tell me when this broken asbestos pipe will be replaced in Adrigole?"

What really concerns me is the lack of urgency from the SEAI and the lack of an action plan to reduce waiting times for what are really vulnerable customers. They need these urgent heating upgrades. It is time we held the SEAI to account. I appeal to the Minister to reach out to the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and his Department to engage with the SEAI. If it cannot deliver the scheme in a timely manner, let us get somebody else to deliver it."

In recent years, the SEAI has received a significant increase in demand for the warmer homes scheme. The increased supports for the scheme have resulted in a significant increase in applications, with 45,000 received over the period from January 2022 to the end of September 2025 and a total of 24,000 homes upgraded under the scheme. The waiting times are too high and that certainly is something I will ask the Minister for the environment to reflect on. However, to be fair to the SEAI, it has significantly reduced its waiting times from what they were. I understand the average waiting time was significantly higher in previous years. There is work ongoing to reduce it."

At noon today, I announced the introduction of a housing order in consultation with my colleague in Northern Ireland, the Minister, Mr. Muir. That will take effect in Ireland from next Monday because we need to allow time for our flock owners and commercial operators to put housing in place. We will work across areas.

I remind the public that we are in a time now of higher risk of avian influenza. The migratory birds have landed here and are carrying it. We need the public to be very aware not to handle sick or dead birds but instead to report them to local and regional veterinary offices. We stand ready to support our poultry sector.

Many of my constituents found themselves unable to use public transport because the DART was not running and buses were full as a result of increased demand. More broadly, there is an issue with the punctuality of buses and no-show buses. For example, the No. 15 bus, which runs through my constituency, is regularly a no-show or late. A number of constituents have contacted me to advise that they were at their stop waiting for the bus and it arrived significantly late or did not show up. The programme for Government commits to improving public transport services and encouraging people to get out of cars and onto public transport. These events do not encourage that. Will the Department of Transport engage with public transport operators to ensure our public transport is reliable and functional all year round?"

In terms of public transport no-shows and issues with levels of services, the National Transport Authority, NTA, has brought in a regime of fines for bus operators that do not operate on time or where there are no-shows. It is quite punitive for a lot of the bus operators, and rightly so, if they do not deliver a service on time or if there are no-shows. I will ask our colleague, the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, to engage with the NTA to ensure there is better co-ordination around major events, which is a fair point, and also to ensure we have an ongoing focus on efficiency.

The nitrates derogation is critically important, not just for our 7,000 derogation farmers, many of whom are in County Tipperary, but for our overall rural economy and for all elements of agriculture. It comes down to land availability and many other measures. This has been a top priority for me since I became Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. I attended the meeting of a couple of thousand of farmers in Fermoy on Monday night. I will meet with Commissioner Roswall, who has accepted my invitation to visit Ireland later this week. I have met with her in Brussels previously. I have met with her officials in Brussels and in Ireland when they visited previously. We brought them out to farms and I will bring Commissioner Roswall to a derogation farm as well when she visits to show her first-hand the great work our farmers are doing in terms of the higher standards they are operating to for water quality.",

We have the habitats directive to address, as well as water quality. That is a very onerous undertaking and we are putting detailed proposals to the Commission right now to get the best possible outcome agreed for our farmers."

It will be brought to Government in the coming weeks. It will set out a series of high-impact reforms targeted at the most significant barriers to the timely delivery of critical infrastructure. These reforms will have a clear focus on reducing timelines and significantly improving outcomes. They will be targeted at the most impactful barriers to infrastructure delivery as outlined in the report published in July. This report identified 12 barriers to the effective delivery of infrastructure in our country.",
                    "The most significant barriers identified are broadly categorised across three headings, which were set out in the report. The first is the regulatory environment, including the growth and complexity of legislation; policy statements and strategies; how consents, licences and permissions for development are obtained; the timelines for these processes, engagement between the regulatory bodies and project developers; and consistency across regulatory bodies.",
                    "The second heading is the planning and legal systems, including the increasing role that the courts play in infrastructure projects; the cascading consequences from these decisions through development cycles; and the impact that the uncertainty in planning and legal decisions are having on projects.",
                    "The third heading is internal systems, such as how the Government allocates funding and develops a credible project pipeline; the rules applied to the development of projects; and how contractors are procured to undertake the works necessary for a project.",
                    "The task force is providing strategic guidance and practical insights into the development of actions to address these barriers. This work is also informed by extensive engagement in the economy with delivery bodies, regulators, and industry representatives, as well as international best practice.",

We have given funding certainty of €102 billion from 2026 to 2030, which is €34 billion over the previous allocation. It provides greater certainty for key strategic projects such as MetroLink, the greater Dublin drainage scheme and the eastern and midlands water supply project, as well as the prioritisation of funding for critical infrastructure, such as electricity, water, and transport to help the supply of new homes and economic competitiveness."

Secondly, within government, where we can control processes or procedures, that means we cut unnecessary levels of process which do not add value but simply add time.

We have been saying it in opposition for years - I try to be constructive and put forward alternative proposals for delivery of infrastructure - but it is only when someone like John Collison writes an article for a national newspaper that senior Government representatives seem to take notice. I understand from the media that Fianna Fáil backbenchers have been saying this for a long time as well. There is a form of fetishisation of bureaucracy in this country. We seem to love it and get caught up in it, but it may have gone too far. In some respects, however, that is a scapegoating exercise. Our problem these days is not money. It was always money but now it is delivery and this Government will be judged on delivery. The IMF said clearly that our infrastructure lags 32% behind comparable countries. It is a rich country that feels very poor."

We need to prioritise domestic simplification and reform to do things quicker, to develop and facilitate economic growth and, ultimately, to deliver infrastructure quicker and build more homes. That is the central metric which will underpin all the work on infrastructure. We will set out the detail around that when it is published in the coming weeks."

It is at the heart of all decision-making at every stage of policy or programme lifecycles. It is about securing the efficient and effective use of public resources and improving living standards and infrastructure for the people of our country. Policy analysis is a core component of public expenditure management and value for money frameworks.",
                    "A wide range of policy and expenditure analysis is undertaken and published by Departments annually. These can take the form of staff papers, focused policy assessments, spending reviews and analytical notes, among others. My Department plays a central role in this process by regularly analysing expenditure trends and policies. Alongside this, individual Departments have responsibility for evaluating the efficiency and impact of their own programmes and policies. Since 2024, approximately 59 papers have been published by Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES, staff across government. During 2025, it produced policy analysis and expenditure evaluations on a broad range of topics, including disability services, social housing, migration and labour market trends, statutory sick leave, well-being, education, transport and youth participation. This analytical research has continued to play a key role in supporting evidence-based policymaking.",

This is communicated through a range of publications including the annual expenditure report and the public service performance report, as well as our expenditure and policy evaluation papers across a range of topics.",
                    "In preparation for budget 2026, my Department undertook several pieces of analysis to support resource allocation. The public service performance report was published in June and it detailed how Departments performed against targets set in the Revised Estimates process. We published the national development plan review in July. We spoke about that previously. Importantly, we published the medium-term expenditure framework in September. This is a multiyear public expenditure planning exercise which supports assessment of the resource implications of future policy decisions over the period from 2025 to 2030."

I have a long list here which I can send to the Deputy of many papers published by IGEES, which is co-ordinated by my Department, as part of its work across government around spending reviews, value for money and providing policy analysis. There have been extensive publications. I could list many publications from this year, such as the well-being framework.

We tested it in September. That happened in Westport. Both I and the Minister, Deputy Chambers, were delighted to be able to join emergency services' colleagues not only from Ireland but from across the EU, who together ran a live testing. It was a maritime scenario where they looked at a Coast Guard vessel that was five miles offshore and they were able to make sure they were able to receive real-time video streaming from an aircraft. This was done using satellite technology. It was done using satellite-enabled links that are designed to provide communication connectivity even if terrestrial networks fail.",

It had well over 1 million visitors in 2022. We do not have access in the same way and decisions were made at the time where it might have asked whether value for money was given in 2022.

All across what we do as a State, and why we stand up here, is ensuring the public gets value for money. We know the difficulties we have. The Minister for infrastructure and public infrastructure is here. The biggest single difficulty facing this country is delivery of infrastructure, notwithstanding how we go towards building housing. We need to get value for money across all areas. I am delighted to be able to raise that today in the context of the OPW."

                    "As Minister, I am responsible for setting overall capital allocations across Departments and for monitoring the relative expenditure and delivery at departmental level. In the national development plan review 2021, the Government originally committed €165 billion in capital investment for the period from 2021 to 2030, and subsequently agreed to additional funding of €2.25 billion in March 2024 for the period from 2024 to 2026. The revised national development plan, published in July, sets out €275.4 billion in public capital investment to 2035, which is the largest and most significant capital injection in our economy in the history of the State. Following the agreement in July of this year of the national development plan review, gross capital ceilings for all sectors have been set out to 2030.",
                    "While the Government has prioritised investment towards the critical growth-enabling sectors of housing, energy, water and transport, all Departments are now tasked with developing sectoral plans for the upcoming five years out to 2030. These plans will detail priority projects to be progressed, and Departments must ensure these are affordable within the overall capital expenditure ceilings, as agreed by the Government. These plans will be published in the coming weeks.",

A range of projects have already been delivered under this since 2021, including, for example, a €6.9 billion investment in capital infrastructure for primary and post-primary schools resulting in 1,200 projects completed, many of which are in the Deputy's constituency; the establishment of 18 Sláintecare healthy communities in disadvantaged areas under the healthy Ireland framework; the Sláintecare healthy homes scheme, from which 4,500 people benefit; and the ongoing work in communities from a public health perspective.",

Given the nature of this strategic priority, many projects take a number of years to fully deliver. Transport has been highlighted and focused on as a critical growth-enabling area in the national development plan review. A total of €22.3 billion was allocated to the Department of Transport for the 2026 to 2030 period. A further €2 billion was allocated to support low-carbon transportation projects, including projects such as MetroLink, under the national development plan review. Considerable progress has been made on a range of projects across the country under this objective since the 2021 review, including, for example, planning permissions for nine bus corridors under BusConnects Dublin; final network details for BusConnects Cork; planning permission for BusConnects Galway; planning implementation for BusConnects Limerick; and work is now ongoing on BusConnects Waterford. Over €320 million has been invested in walking and cycling projects through the active travel infrastructure programme.",

We need to accelerate delivery, and we are fronting up on doing an extensive amount more on capital investment in our economy, but a huge amount has been delivered. We are seeing that in our school system in terms of social infrastructure. We are also seeing it with a lot of the public transport projects and continued investment in the road network, as well as the delivering of outcomes for bed capacity in our health system. We need to balance the conversation. A lot of infrastructure is being delivered but we want to do more and do it quicker."

I believe €795 million has been ring-fenced until 2030 for capital funding for the Department of Children, Disability and Equality. Over the last two years, €45 million was allocated to expand childcare capacity, which is positive. I think we all recognise that is not enough. In this year's budget, €36 million was set aside for 2026 to develop a new programme of acquisition and fit-out of State-led early years and school-age care settings to provide 700 additional places. We have the building blocks extension scheme, which will open in 2026 for extensions and modifications to deliver approximately 1,500 places.

According to Dublin Chamber, 90% of firms claim a lack of affordable childcare is damaging recruitment and retention. Parents, primarily women, are struggling to return to work, as we know from talking to our constituents in Dublin West. This is an economic issue and an equality issue. It is biting and it is hurting families now. Childcare fees are still a second mortgage for families, particularly those whose fees have increased substantially because their crèches pulled out of core funding. We need a big vision of childcare but we also need big delivery. The Department of children is working on an action plan. Capital funding and infrastructure are absolutely key to that. Will the money be there to fund the delivery at the scale we need?"

The Minister, Deputy Foley, is working with her allocation of €795 million over the next five years. Obviously, that includes children, equality and disability. She is working on a on a multiyear sectoral plan to set out specific steps and overall allocations in respect of some of the childcare schemes the Deputy referenced. As part of the budget, we agreed to continue. Obviously, the increased demand for childcare across our economy has had to be funded in the context of budget 2026. An additional 35,000 places under the national childcare scheme are being supported in that context.",

We have a wider vision on childcare in the programme for Government whereby we want to make progress across successive budgets when it comes to the affordability initiatives but also the capital allocations, which will be set out in the coming weeks."

Where we have opportunities on public transport, we should be using the increased capital allocation from a transport perspective to get projects moving. The Minister, Deputy O'Brien, is working on the sectoral investment plan for the Department of Transport, working with TII and the National Transport Authority. DART+ West is a really good example of a project we need to advance over the coming years. A critical part of the transport sector investment plan will be setting out the timeline for that and putting the detail around that so we give clear certainty to the market about our intent. Trying to attract more international contractors will be critical so we have a broader transformation of public transport investment over the coming years. That will be a priority as part of the capital plan and it is also a priority in the existing national development plan."

Recently, I was back in University Hospital Limerick with other politicians looking at a new ward system, a new 96-bed block, a five-storey building. Angela Coll of the Ennis hospital committee was recently in the Minister's office, where the three of us had a good discussion. When I spoke to clinicians that day, they were delighted with this five-storey building and the 96-bed block. However, they made the point that another one is needed and probably even three. I made the point that we should build up and instead of going to five stories, go to ten or 12 storeys. I wrongly believed that there was some planning barrier to this. They told me it was because of the €200 million spending cap. That is just ludicrous because it becomes more costly to go back and build a new one and another one. I take some hope and solace from the fact that the Minister has not finalised his plans yet. When it comes to healthcare, particularly in the mid-west region where there is a healthcare apartheid, I appeal to the Minister to raise the cap so that when we are building a new block, we go higher, we go bigger and we build as many wards with as many beds as we need, not just as many as we can afford to do at that particular time."

The upper floor must be load-bearing, so it can take more units and wards if required. All the services, including sewerage, water and electricity services, are then introduced but then you have to stop because the ceiling is reached. That is totally impractical. It does not meet patient needs and is not achieving the value we should obtain from public expenditure. One has to go all the way through the planning process again and build another block.

The guidelines the Deputy referred to, which have multiple gateways, need to be reformed and changed. There is too much circular analysis, which in many instances does not add value and adds time. That is why there is going to be change. Some of the reforms we will be introducing will be practical steps that will reduce the time and help deliver infrastructure better.",
                    "The Deputy is correct that when developing a site, there should be better intensification and use of it, particularly if it is a hospital site that has only a limited amount of land available and potential future needs. We will be able to detail actions that will make a genuine difference and practical steps we can control within internal systems in government and the State, and then ensure we promote reform. Reform is as important as the allocations around expenditure policy. The obsession in this House is often who gets what and how much. Reform is the most important aspect of resolving issues with infrastructure delivery and rebalancing excessive regulation that is not adding value and is holding back growth. That is what I intend to do."

It is a problem that is getting worse and worse each year as time goes by. It is having a severe impact on the livelihoods of the people affected. There are hundreds of families affected by this and it has caused devastation. For example, in 2023, farmers lost everything as land was flooded through the summer. In recent weeks, there has been severe flooding again, impacting on land and livestock. People in the local area feel that this problem is now almost out of control. They are frustrated as they do not believe strong enough efforts have been taken to tackle this situation. In particular, there has been a lack of investment between Meelick and Athlone to take out the pinch points and a lack of ongoing river maintenance to get the situation under control.

We achieved it and we did it.

              "paragraphs": [
                "Both I and the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, very much welcome the opportunity to discuss in Dáil Éireann the processing and enforcement of international protection. It is important to emphasise what, in fact, is meant by \"international protection\". It is sometimes confused with other areas of immigration. \"International protection\" is the term that we use to describe those people who come to countries such as Ireland, or indeed any other country, because they say that they are fleeing persecution or war. It derives from the 1951 Geneva Convention, which was put in place in the aftermath of the Second World War when we saw very many examples of people being persecuted in countries or having to flee war because of events outside their control. When we talk about international protection, we are talking about the term that is used for the purpose of describing individuals fleeing war and persecution.",
                "The term \"international protection\" became common in usage within the European Union. For the purpose of trying to identify what are the laws in Ireland governing international protection, I refer people to the International Protection Act 2015. As Members will be aware, that legislation, in effect, transposes into Irish law the directives and regulations in respect of international protection that were agreed to and introduced by the European Union. It is important at the outset that we understand by \"international protection\".",
                "The reason I wanted to make that opening comment is international protection is only an element, a proportion, of immigration into Ireland. We need to put the numbers of people coming in and claiming asylum into the context of the general figures for immigration in Ireland. In doing that, and in forming that context, I always go back to the population of the island that existed 185 years ago in 1840. The population of Ireland before the Famine was 8 million. The devastation of the Famine is evident from the fact that today on the island of Ireland we have not yet got back to those figures.",
                "What we have noticed in recent years, and this is particularly aligned with our economic success and the attractiveness of Ireland as a country, is that immigration has increased significantly. If I had to choose between the population of Ireland going up or down, I would favour the former. We saw what happened for many years when the population was declining and it can destroy a country.",
                "On immigration generally, I would like to put on the record some of the statistics in respect of the numbers of people who came into Ireland so we can assess the numbers of people coming in and claiming international protection. The Central Statistics Office, CSO, produces finely tuned statistics on the matter. For the year ending April 2024, the CSO recently recorded that 149,200 people immigrated into Ireland. Of those, 30,000 were returning Irish citizens, 27,000 were other EU citizens, 5,400 were UK citizens and approximately 86,800 were citizens of other countries, including Ukraine. I will return to that issue presently. Those were the numbers who came into Ireland. Of course, people leave each year. Approximately 70,000 people left Ireland in the year ending April 2024. Those consisted of 34,700 Irish citizens, 10,600 other EU citizens, 3,000 UK citizens and 21,500 other citizens, including Ukrainians.",
                "It is important to set out those figures for the numbers coming to and leaving Ireland before we come to assess and appraise the figures in respect of international protection. Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, the number of people coming into Ireland were approximately 3,000 to 4,000 each year. The numbers obviously dropped significantly in 2020 and 2021 because of the travel ban and the impact of Covid restrictions. I think 1,500 and 2,500, respectively, came into Ireland in 2020 and 2021. There was then a significant increase in the numbers coming in in 2022 and 2023. In fact, in each of those years 13,500 people arrived to Ireland claiming international protection. In 2024, 18,500 people arrived to Ireland claiming international protection. During 2022, 2023 and 2024, in the region of 44,000 or 45,000 people came into Ireland and claimed international protection.",
                "At the same time, we were also providing temporary protection to people who were fleeing the war in Ukraine. I will not go into the details of the distinction between temporary protection and international protection but obviously it is known that when it comes to temporary protection, people similarly are entitled to come here for that purpose. A significant number of people came into Ireland claiming either international protection or permanent protection on the basis of what was happening in Ukraine and, indeed, what was happening internationally.",
                "I just wanted to set those statistics in context because it is important that we do not allow the discussion about international protection to be viewed solely as the cause of immigration in Ireland or as what it is being generated by; it is not. There is a whole variety of other reasons people are coming into Ireland. Most of them are coming in to work. The Minister of State has responsibility for the visa systems. Last year, we issued approximately 150,000 visas for people to come to Ireland, many of them to work. Many of them come for holidays and the short term. It is important that we understand and get a sense of the proportion of people coming here to seek international protection in the context of general immigration.",
                "What does, however, distinguish international protection applications from other individuals who are coming to Ireland on a work or holiday visa is that in the context of international protection, we have obligations to fulfil. The two most prominent obligations are to provide a place of accommodation for people who come here claiming international protection and to process their applications. The reason we have to do that is that it is not the case that simply because somebody claims to be entitled to international protection, they are so entitled. Every country in the European Union and the world has a system in place for the purpose of appraising and assessing those applications to determine whether they are valid or should be rejected. In each European Union country, there is an obligation to provide an appeal mechanism. People who are rejected at first instance must be given the capacity for appeal. Unquestionably, what puts tension and pressure on the Irish system of governance is the fact that we must provide accommodation. When, prior to Covid, we were processing 2,000, 3,000 or 4,000 applications per year, we are able to do so. In fact, the criticism at the time was that direct provision centres were not suitable enough and needed to be improved, and unquestionably they did. That was the political argument at that stage. In 2022, 2023 and 2024, because of the numbers arriving in, there was a crisis in the system. That is unquestionably the case and neither I or the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, would have any hesitancy in saying that the surge in numbers created a crisis. It was extremely difficult to provide accommodation for every person. In fact, in truth, we were not able to provide accommodation for everyone. That is the important architecture in understanding the system of international protection.",
                "I also want to say something at this stage, in parenthesis if I can, about events that have taken place over the past two weeks. We have seen some reprehensible acts over the past two weeks. I mention them not just for the purpose of condemnation but also for the purpose of communicating a message. We saw approximately two weeks ago an allegation of serious sexual assault against a child being made against a person who had applied for international protection and had been refused but was still being accommodated within an International Protection Accommodation Services, IPAS, centre. We then saw serious acts of violence and rioting committed against members of An Garda Síochána and attempts were made to attack and cause damage to the centre in Citywest. Last weekend, we saw the reprehensible act of an individual trying to set a building on fire in the knowledge that there were people in that building. Let us be honest about it: that was an attempted murder if ever I saw one, in terms of the consequences of a fire going up on that stairwell.",
                "I refer to those three reprehensible acts because it is extremely important that in this House we do not allow that extreme behaviour or the criminal acts of others to dictate our policy when it comes to international protection. I know all of us in this House will be outraged by the acts I have recounted. I urge people to ensure we do not allow extremists and people involved in criminal activity to dictate and mould how we will respond in terms of policy to the issues raised in respect of international protection. It is important not only that we condemn those acts but also that we do not permit the individuals who were behind perpetrating them to have any belief that their actions will mould or change our behaviour.",
                "In terms of the processing of international protection applications, it is obviously the case that if 18,500 people come to Ireland claiming international protection, as was the case last year, it will be a very significant job to process those applications. That processing is done by my Department through the International Protection Office, IPO. Each individual who comes to Ireland and claims asylum, or international protection as it is more formally called, will have an interview in the IPO. Their account will be appraised by an officer and a determination will be made in respect of it. My predecessor started the process of improving the numbers within the IPO and I commend her on doing so. There were 143 IPO staff in 2019 and I am pleased to say that today there are 620, which is an increase of 334%. It is extremely important for people who come and make an application for international protection to have their applications dealt with promptly. It is fairer for them to have their applications dealt with promptly and it is fairer for the Irish system as well. We have seen an increase in the number of staff at the IPO, but we also seen an increase in the use of ICT and technology. It is now a paperless office. The Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, and I have visited the IPO and we have seen that it is run extremely efficiently. We can see the benefit of further investment in the IPO in the numbers of decisions it is making each year. Last year it delivered 14,000 first decisions, compared with 8,500 in 2023. Already this year we have seen 16,600 decisions. I am confident that by the end of this year we will see the IPO produce 20,000 decisions. This is achieving the policy objective that the Minister of State and I have set. We want to see applications determined more quickly and efficiently.",
                "Later this year or early next year I will bring a new international protection Bill before the House. It will seek to put in place a requirement, imposed on me, on my office and on the appeals process, that we determine applications within a period of 12 weeks. That is something people may think cannot be achieved but I am pleased to tell this House that since July of this year we have been running a pilot project within the IPO and the International Protection Appeals Tribunal, IPAT, which has been assessing applications from three countries - Georgia, Brazil and India - to see whether we can fulfil our time obligations that will kick in during June of next year. I am pleased to say that pilot has been successful. We have seen over 300 decisions from applicants from those countries which have gone through first stage, the appeals stage, and in many instances deportation orders signed, within a period of 12 weeks. Let us be clear that the policy objective of the Government is to ensure that by the middle of June 2026, applications for international protection made after that date will be processed extremely quickly; within 12 weeks, including the appeals process. I think that is a fair system. I know others in the House may think it is unfair to process applications with such speed but I disagree. My view, and the policy I am seeking to set out, is that it is fairer on everyone concerned if we can get a determination in respect of applications promptly and within the 12-week period.",
                "A person who brings an application before the IPO has an entitlement to appeal a decision to IPAT. At the end of 2024 there were 9,700 appeals pending; as of now there are nearly 17,000 appeals pending. We are getting through the appeals faster this year than last year. The number of appeals pending is increasing because of the number of people who arrived during the previous three years. I also recently announced that Ireland has signed an operational plan with the European Agency for Asylum, EUAA. I know this will provide us with great support. Under the agreement, up to 30 new personnel from that association will assist us in our supports. That is about the processing of international protection applications.",
                "I cannot ignore the fact that approximately 81% of applications are rejected at first instance. Approximately 70% to 76% of those refusals are appealed but even on appeal, only 25% to 30% of appeals are granted. I cannot shy away from the fact that the majority of people who apply for international protection are refused. I know some people in this House do not want to say that and they do not have to say that. I am not requiring them to do so. As Minister for justice, along with the Minister of State with responsibility for migration, Deputy Brophy, I cannot shy away from that. We would be remiss in our duties if we were to do so. When that happens, the question that must arise is what happens to people who have gone through the system and have been told they are not entitled to international protection. What should happen to them? The remedy is that we serve them with deportation orders. If it were the case that everyone who applies can stay, regardless of whether they are successful or unsuccessful, we would not be able to cope with the numbers who would come to Ireland. I want to be frank about what would happen if we were to adopt such a policy.",
                "I think everyone in this House realises that there has to be a consequence when somebody is refused international protection. There is a consequence under the policy we are operating. Already this year, I have issued nearly 4,000 deportation orders and approximately 1,700 people have been removed from Ireland through voluntary returns, enforced deportations, deportations on charter flights or deportations on commercial flights. It is not something from which the Minister of State or I derive pleasure, but we would be neglecting our very serious responsibilities if we did not seek to do it. Voluntary return is the mechanism we prefer to ensure people will accept an assisted offer to go back. The message has to be delivered fairly unambiguously that if people apply for international protection, are refused and are served with a deportation order, they must leave the country. Already this year, up to 31 October, I have signed 3,877 deportation orders and 1,770 people have had their departures confirmed through these pathways.",
                "Deputies will ask how it can happen that somebody with a deportation order can still be in the country. I think Deputy McDonald raised this issue in respect of the suspect who was arrested following the alleged sexual assault in Citywest. When a deportation order is issued, it gives a person a certain period of time to leave the country. There are mechanisms whereby he or she can seek to appeal that order, and there are mechanisms that can have an impact in delaying giving effect to the deportation order. On many occasions it is to the advantage of the Department and me to have people who have deportation orders present in an international protection accommodation centre. We know they are there. Recent charter flights I have directed have been assisted by the fact we knew where the people with the deportation orders were. They were in an international protection accommodation services, IPAS, centre and we could remove them because of that. I do not profess to say that this is an easy issue; it is not. It is complex. The Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, and I are seeking to say that there is a rules-based system and if people comply with the rules, they will be satisfactorily responded to by Ireland."

                "Along with the Minister, Deputy O'Callaghan, I will start by addressing the terrible arson attack that took place in Drogheda over the weekend. Our thoughts are with the families impacted by this. It was an attack on an IPAS centre but it was actually an attack on their home. It is truly awful to see something like that happen to someone's home. My thoughts are also with the victim of the alleged sexual assault in Saggart recently. I also want to commend An Garda Síochána members who so bravely defended the peace in Citywest when faced with such abhorrent behaviour. We put our trust in the justice process to deliver due process over the coming months.",
                "As we start this debate, we have seen the discourse on migration that has become increasingly fraught across the world. Here in Ireland we are not immune to the impact of this polarised debate. The incidents in Drogheda and Citywest show the extent to which this is impacting communities. We have seen anti-immigrant protests on our streets. We have seen attacks on international protection accommodation. We have seen attacks on international protection accommodation where people knew that women and children were staying. We have seen the dire consequences of the anti-migrant rhetoric in and the shocking racist attacks on our minority communities. The Government is determined to combat such racist crime and protect vulnerable communities.",
                "The vast majority of Irish people are, I believe, positive towards migration because we know the value of migration to Ireland. Migration benefits our economy, our public services, our infrastructure and has made Ireland a pluralist and more open society. The Government is operating under a clear and co-ordinated strategy to manage immigration in what I want to see, as does the Minister, as a firm, fair and effective way, in a rules-based system. The programme for Government provides a commitment to developing a new migration and integration strategy for Ireland detailing how we intend to meet the demands and the opportunities facing our society and economy over the next decade. This strategy is being led by my Department with support from across Government and we plan to publish it in 2026. It is important to point out that this is the first time such a strategy has been undertaken and we are determined that our approach to migration is rules based, planned and coherent.",
                "The Minister, Deputy O’Callaghan, has gone through in some detail the significant reforms ongoing in the international protection process. This is being done through ongoing legislative reforms, investment in our processing capacity, and particularly with our enhanced co-operation with our EU partners. We are addressing our international obligations and the legitimate concerns of communities across the country.",
                "The programme for Government also contains strong commitments on consultation with communities about local services and integration, and to improved communications on migration and integration. Yes we do accept that we need to improve this. There have been failings in the past and we need to see more improvement in this area. The community engagement team in my Department has a role to share information, to engage, to listen and to help communities prepare for new arrivals. They are doing an excellent job. It is important in these engagements to balance our discussions between recognising the need for urgent shelter for people who are in very vulnerable situations and who are legally entitled to it, and to also recognise the needs and sincerely-held concerns of communities.",
                "By necessity, the work of the community engagement team has to date focused on the opening of new accommodation centres. Some of these engagements have been a simple sharing of relevant information through the relevant channels while in some centres it has involved far more detailed meetings with local community groups, local officials, local public representatives, national representatives and other key stakeholders. This work has involved the provision of briefing notes, the organisation of information sessions and responding to queries from both community organisations and public representatives. It has also involved strategic engagement with key Departments and agencies, local government and civil society organisations. It is vitally important that this work continues and that the community engagement team continues to strengthen engagement at local community level.",
                "Our overall strategic approach is intended to reduce the scale of the demand for accommodation. We want to see the proportion of accommodation provided on State-owned sites increase, with the objective of developing an accommodation system with a reduced reliance on commercial provision. I believe, as does the Minister, that it is particularly important that we move to that process of, by and large, having State-owned facilities so we can provide the best value for money and services: services to the people in those centres and services to the communities that surround them and the best value for money for Irish taxpayers.",
                "I also want to introduce a contribution model for people in international protection accommodation. In this regard, a proposal was considered by the Cabinet subcommittee on migration this week, which came from the Minister and me. The programme for Government included a commitment to introduce such a system. It is expected that the proposals will now be developed and timelines for implementation will be finalised and brought to Government in the coming weeks. While I appreciate that this has been a proposal that was there previously, the Minister and I have worked tirelessly on this over the past weeks to ensure we can bring this proposal to Government in the next few weeks. Not all applicants in centres are working but many are. I believe it makes sense that people who are working and paying income tax would make a contribution towards the cost of their accommodation. It is only fair. The system I want is a system based on fairness. If a person is working in a factory, in a shop or in a tech company, and they are working alongside somebody who is paying for their rent at the end of the month, then there is no reason that person, if he or she has an income, should not be making a contribution to their own accommodation.",
                "I want to move on now to the area of removals. Part of an effective immigration system needs to be an effective returns system. We are working at national level and with EU partners on this. The proposal for a new returns regulation, as presented at European Union level, would establish a common European system for returns with the aim of a swifter, simpler and more effective returns procedure across the EU, while fully respecting fundamental rights. This proposed new legal framework is a complementary measure to the EU Migration and Asylum Pact. It is the Government’s preference that Ireland is part of the new returns measure. Officials in my Department are continuing to engage with European colleagues to determine the most appropriate means for Ireland’s participation. Any decision to participate would be made following the approval of the Oireachtas. My Department firmly believes that it is in the mutual interest of all member states and Schengen-associated countries to ensure as broad a level of participation as possible to reduce fragmentation to ensure coherence and support operational effectiveness across the Union.",
                "As Ireland continues to show its active engagement and involvement in the European Union, I believe that a lack of participation in this proposal could potentially undermine the efforts to bring about effective harmonisation and coherence in the returns domain. Participation in the returns measure would ensure that Ireland can benefit from enhanced co-operation and information sharing with other member states. I must emphasise that my Department is not waiting for the European Union to return people who should not be in the State. As the Minister has indicated, returns this year are the highest they have been for 20 years. We have had six charter removal flights so far this year, coupled with a large increase in those being removed on commercial flights. Just this week, 52 people were removed on a charter back to Georgia. There has also been a large increase in EU citizens removed under the free movement regulations. These orders can be made on the grounds that an individual’s personal conduct represents a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society. The number of removal orders under the freedom of movement directive has increased from 24 in 2024 to 99 so far this year. On Monday, 13 October removal orders were enforced against 23 Romanian citizens who were removed from Ireland by charter flight. A very high bar must be met for a person to be removed under this directive but it is a priority for the Minister and me to ensure that those who meet the threshold are removed from the State accordingly.",
                "Our immigration system is not just about faster processing and a more effective system. We are concerned that when people are granted permission to remain in Ireland, we are ensuring that these people are integrated into Irish society. If one is going to have an effective removal system, one also needs to have an effective system for integration when someone is allowed to remain. My Department administers a series of funds to support anti-racism and integration initiatives around the country. I will be announcing the outcome of a funding call for the integration funding next week. My officials are currently finalising the outcomes of that process.",
                "The Ireland against racism fund, which is a key part of the national action plan against racism, enables non-government and community organisations to provide projects and local initiatives that combat racism. The EU’s Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund, AMIF, aims to support international protection applicants, programme refugees, beneficiaries of temporary protection and other third country nationals in Ireland. Ireland's total budget allocation for the AMIF 2021-2027 national programme is €63.5 million.",
                "The integration and employment of migrants grant scheme is part of the European Social Fund Plus. The total funding under the scheme is €5.5 million, made available over a seven-year period. In 2022, seven projects were approved for total funding of €2.7 million for a three-year period. I announced a second call for funding under this programme in July this year.",
                "Ireland has shown its commitment to a common EU-wide solution to migration by opting in to most elements of the EU migration and asylum pact. The pact is a landmark in our collective effort to manage migration with fairness, compassion, effectiveness and order. It recognises the need for solidarity and shared responsibility across all member states. It emphasises border protection while upholding international law. Crucially, it allows us to distinguish between those in genuine need of protection and those who do not qualify, thereby enabling swifter and more just outcomes. It is really important to recognise that it does not just benefit the country in question; it benefits people going through the process when decisions can be made for them in a fast and effective way. Our commitment to the pact, alongside other member states, shows we stand together in recognising that no country should be left to face these pressures alone. Whether by welcoming refugees, supporting returns or contributing to border management, every state has a role to play and Ireland is no different. The pact also promotes deeper co-operation with countries of origin and transit. We must work upstream by addressing the drivers of migration, tackling trafficking networks and supporting development. We need global solutions for what are global issues.",
                "Much of the public focus on the pact has been on those aspects related to reception conditions and assessment procedures for people arriving seeking international protection. However, an important aspect of a well-managed and effective migration and asylum policy is having the successful integration and inclusion policy about which I have been talking. That is why we are committed to continuing to provide practical ways to support local communities involved in integration efforts right across Ireland.",
                "Along with the Minister, Deputy O'Callaghan, I consider it very important, particularly in light of what the country has faced in the past week, that we, as an Oireachtas, can have a balanced conversation that respects all the key requirements of the debate. There must be an understanding that there are very vulnerable people who apply for international protection - they are here in our country and we need to understand, look after and respect the process they are going through - and there are also communities that have very genuine concerns. People in those communities must be engaged with and have an opportunity to have their voice heard. They need to see real leadership in this area from us, as public representatives, as Members of this House and as the Government. People who are able and willing to stand up and comment must be allowed to speak and to have their voice heard but we must not pander to the extremes. We must never allow the extremes to win. We must respect what everyone is saying, listen to it fully and work together. For the sake of our country and its long-term future, which will be as a fully integrated modern Ireland with lots of different types of people in it, we must be able to have these discussions and deliver real results out of them."

                "I welcome this debate on international protection but I am very conscious that it could be taking place in very different circumstances. The backdrop to these statements could, but for the grace of God, have been multiple fatalities as a result of the arson attack in Drogheda. I want to be unequivocal in stating that there can be absolutely no tolerance for racism or racist attacks. Nobody should be in fear for their safety or their children's safety. The message must go out loud and clear that racist attacks on any community or on those living in IPAS accommodation will not be tolerated. The attack in Drogheda was clearly a traumatic ordeal for those impacted, especially the small children involved. I commend the members of the emergency services who saved lives. I hope those who carried out this and similar attacks are brought before the courts and held to account for their crimes.",
                "I also want to be clear in stating there is no contradiction in condemning such racist attacks and also raising concerns about Government mismanagement of immigration generally or the international protection system specifically. The former is abhorrent and unacceptable; the latter is entirely legitimate. In fact, criticisms of Government handling of these matters are not just acceptable but well founded because the international protection system, in particular, is dysfunctional. That is not the fault of those applying for asylum; it is the fault of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, which have made a mess of a system that continues to operate in crisis mode. Decisions on international protection applications are taking too long, as are appeals, and deportations are not enforced. All the while, there is massive profiteering from the provision of often inappropriate IPAS accommodation.",
                "On migration, the Government makes decisions without any consideration of the consequences and with no plan to deal with those consequences. For example, the Government signed up earlier this year to an extension of the temporary protection directive in respect of Ukrainians. There was no consideration of numbers, costs, capacity or other implications in terms of Ukrainians coming to Ireland. The Minister did not even bring the matter to the Dáil for debate, let alone approval, and now he scampers along, making decisions on the hoof and playing catch-up with the Government's lack of forethought. Equally, the decision by the Government to sign up to the EU migration and asylum pact in its entirety is a mistake. It undermines Irish sovereignty and binds us to EU rules that will not take into account our unique circumstances, including that we are part of a common travel area with a state outside the EU. In a week when the Government is citing EU law as an obstacle to implementing contributions to accommodation costs for international protection applicants in asylum and trying to blame EU law for housing delays, it is bizarre that it has yet to realise that tying us into an EU framework that will not only tie the Minister's hands but also the hands of future Ministers is the wrong approach.",
                "There has been a lot of focus on the international protection system, and rightly so. It is a broken system. I have been clear and unapologetic in stating that it has failed local communities and raised divisions and tensions. It has not worked for those communities that have lost local amenities such as hotels and have been given no additional supports by way of investment in health services, educational services or gardaí. The approach of locating IPAS centres in areas based on the single criterion of there being a building owned by someone prepared to provide it for that purpose is the wrong one. It has stripped many communities - working-class communities, in particular - of any sense of agency or being part of the decisions that shape their own areas. It is long past time to end the planning exemption for IPAS and Ukrainian accommodation and ensure a proper system of community engagement in order that communities are part of the decisions that affect them.",
                "We also need to be clear that this dysfunctional system is not working for those fleeing war or persecution. Housing people in communities that are already under pressure does not serve them well. Placing people in accommodation that is often substandard, without fire certificates and without access to the services they need does not serve them well. Forcing people to wait years for applications to be processed does not serve them well. Alongside the pressures this clearly puts on the system, it feeds into the overall sense that the system is broken.",
                "It is still taking far too long for decisions to be made. For those who appeal, the mean processing time is over 2.5 years. That is failure and inefficiency writ large. Even for the so-called accelerated procedure, the overall processing time, including appeals, is 15 months. That is not good enough. While there has been an increase in staff in the international protection system, there is still a vacancy rate of more than 10%. All this means that those awaiting decisions are left in limbo for far longer than they should be. It also means some who will ultimately be adjudicated not to have an entitlement to be in Ireland are holding up accommodation while others who are fleeing war and persecution are rendered homeless.",
                "The international protection system is also not working for the taxpayer, which is picking up the tab for an ever-increasing bill for accommodation while those providing the accommodation make fortunes. IPAS alone is projected to cost €1.2 billion this year, with virtually no transparency and zero accountability. How and why has it been allowed to get to this point? Is it just part of the wider failures we have come to expect from Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael governments? Is it just Government incompetence? The system is working for some people. It is working for those who have become millionaires on the back of the provision of IPAS accommodation. This is a scandal of which we have only barely scratched the surface. For months, I have been calling for a full review of all IPAS contracts granted. The Minister has refused. The system is also working for those companies that gain access to often low-paid, non-unionised and vulnerable workers. These are companies that would not be eligible to get work permits. The system fails the applicants, the communities and the taxpayer but it is benefiting a brand new golden circle.",
                "How very Fianna Fáil.",
                "Sinn Féin is clear. We have to have a managed immigration policy, one that recognises the value of those who come here but also recognises the challenges in capacity, housing and public services and the ability to integrate. On international protection, it is clear we need a rules-based system, where applications are processed in a timely manner, where those found to have a genuine need for international protection are supported to integrate and where those who are not entitled to be here leave or are deported. It is in everyone's interest that the State manages immigration properly. That means managing international protection, work permits and economic migration and those entering the State as tourists and as students and it means ensuring the very small minority who abuse an Irish welcome by becoming involved in criminality are quickly deported. All of that is a basic necessity of proper governance. Instead, we have had a litany of Government failures.",
                "Those failures were crystalised for many by the horrendous recent events at Citywest. It would be a huge mistake for this House to ignore the widespread public anger about what happened to the young girl in this instance. Those who engaged in the violent disorder afterwards, trapped people in their homes and attacked gardaí must be condemned, but that should not allow us to disregard the genuine fury over what happened. What happened was a result of catastrophic failures by the State, in terms of both keeping a vulnerable child safe and ensuring somebody not entitled to be here had left the State.",
                "The questions hanging over Tusla remain unanswered. How does a ten-year-old girl go missing without the public being informed? How the hell does Tusla get away with issuing a statement that essentially blamed the child for Tusla's failure and talked about absconding as if describing a violent criminal? How is this the latest of a series of Tusla failures and yet the Government will not acknowledge that there is a systemic problem in that body? An equally valid question is how someone enters the international protection system, remains in it for six years, receives a deportation order and yet remains in this State to be charged with such a heinous crime. Above all, the question people want answered is whether the Government can give an assurance this will not happen again.",
                "The problem with deportation orders is that the Government is not enforcing them. More than anything, that has led to the undermining of people's confidence in the IPAS system. Yes, more deportation orders have been signed but today, the Minister does not know whether the vast majority of those subject to deportations have left or remain in the State. In 2024, for example, there were 2,403 deportation orders but only 156 confirmed deportations. That is a ratio of 6.5%. While there have been a number of high-profile deportation flights, there is no evidence of whether the wider enforcement in the system has improved.",
                "Across the international protection system, we know changes need to be made in ensuring decisions are made quickly and enforced, including deportation orders, and in bringing the obscene profiteering to an end. Sinn Féin has set them out time and time again. Instead of Simon Harris, Micheál Martin or even the Minister, Deputy O'Callaghan, speaking as if they were passing commentators, we need the Government to make the changes we have outlined once and for all."

It is no surprise either that people recognise the value that nurses from the Philippines, doctors from Syria and engineers from India bring to our society, our economy and our service provision, which would really struggle without them. Ireland remains a welcoming country. It is no surprise either that the Irish public requires and demands that the Government and its agencies manage, regulate and oversee all aspects of the migration of people in an orderly and efficient way. Today's statements are about the international protection system processing and enforcement. The system created and presided over by the Government, as my colleague has said, is broken, not fit for purpose and now does not command the confidence of the public. That is a big problem.",
                "The processing of applications takes far too long. Deportation orders go unenforced. There are no exit checks. Too often, the State does not know if those issued with deportation orders have actually left. Sickeningly, there is massive profiteering from the provision of IPAS accommodation. The Government has made multimillionaires of a small group of people, virtually overnight. Millions have been made from the misery of others. Meanwhile, communities are sidelined, ignored and left behind without the basic resources needed in housing, healthcare and local services. It goes without saying that upholding safety is paramount in any system that functions and commands people's trust. The arson attack on Drogheda at the weekend - the attempt to burn people alive that endangered the lives of small children and led to babies being taken to hospital - was callous, disgusting and indefensible. Those responsible are the most vile of cowards and must face the full weight of the law. Yesterday, my colleague an Teachta Joanna Byrne shared on the floor of this House just how unsafe that particular IPAS accommodation had been prior to any arson attack. Those poor people were doubly failed.",
                "The sexual assault of a ten-year-old child in Citywest last month was sickening. The news that the man charged with the assault was subject to a deportation order months ago and yet still remained in the country really shocked and angered people. The violence that followed all of that is in no way acceptable and is in no way excused in any set of circumstances, but people no longer trust that the system ensures safety for the public or for those in IPAS accommodation. That is a failure of Government. An international protection system can only work if it is grounded in fair, reasonable and enforceable rules, mindful of the need to safeguard social cohesion, respect communities, protect people's rights and command public confidence. That means those whose applications are successful and have leave to remain here must lead full lives, enjoy opportunity, contribute to our society and be fully integrated, but it also means that where an application fails and where a deportation order is issued, it must be enforced efficiently and speedily. It is only through the full enforcement of all the rules that we can have a system that works and enjoys people's trust.",
                "The vast majority of our people not alone reject racism but see it as abhorrent, ugly and un-Irish. They have no truck with those who seek to spread hate in our communities and we all have a solemn duty to keep every person safe on our streets and in our communities and to create an atmosphere where people of goodwill can have an open, honest conversation about how we build a system that works, a system that meets our international protection obligations in a fair way and deals with the concerns and needs of the people of Ireland.",
                "People want to see an end to the Government's chaotic approach and a migration system and international protection system with a book of rules that is clear, strong, reasonable and fully enforced. That is a fair and reasonable expectation and it is the responsibility of the Government to deliver."

It has buried its head in the sand, stating how much it is spending to fix the problem, which only continually gets worse. It is solely responsible for the mess and it will not be remedied under this Government, which makes statements in the press but then takes a hands-off or do-nothing approach. Recent comments by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste show they are taking no responsibility for their own failures in relation to migration. Because of the failures of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael in government, our migration and international protection system is a mess and is operating in crisis mode. Every stroke of the pen takes too long, from decisions to appeals to deportations. Worse, there is massive profiteering in the provision of inappropriate IPAS accommodation.",

The Government should not be able to dismiss the C and AG's review but I have no doubt it will do its best to ignore it. The review is damning about a lack of due diligence and payment controls in the awarding of IPAS contracts, which the State is due to spend €1.2 billion on this year alone. The Irish taxpayer deserves better.",
                "Following the despicable arson attack on the IPAS accommodation in my hometown of Drogheda, the Government ordered a security review of all IPAS accommodation. General security in emergency details is already part of the IPPS inspection checklist to ensure the occupants are safe. From what I have witnessed, this is not the case. I refer the Minister to the fact I outlined to the House yesterday, where one of those families in Drogheda had no way out of the burning building except via stairs that were ravaged with flames. When we checked the inspections, we saw that few inspections have been published for 2025. In fact, only two have been published for County Louth for this year as the year draws to a close. Will the Minister tell me why this is the case? Is there a lack of inspectors or are issues that require remediation arising that we are not hearing about? Similarly, there is no inspection report for the D Hotel in Drogheda. The last review, in 2024, counted only 89 occupants despite the hotel having capacity for over 500. This was the only hotel in the largest town in this country and it was ripped out of the tourism and hospitality sector. I call on the Minister to publish the 2025 reports for all IPAS accommodation in County Louth immediately. If he cannot do that, he must make a statement to this House to explain why.",
                "Following recent events, the people of this State, County Louth and indeed Drogheda need to be certain that those operating IPAS accommodation centres have been awarded contracts appropriately and based on merit, providing value for money and in areas that can accommodate them. The people of this State and more importantly those in IPAS accommodation deserve a system that is fair, efficient and enforced. It is time to stop prioritising profiteering."

At this stage, most of us have seen the images - we have all been appalled by them - of an accelerant being poured before the fire was lit, a fire that trapped children including a small baby on the upper floor of that building. If not for the quick action of our local fire services, we could be talking about a very different situation here today. I hope every community leader will send out the message that attacks on any community cannot and will not be accepted.",

We get announcements designed for headlines - there was another one today - but little or no action. We get commentary from the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach, who, it seems, have finally woken up to the reality that things are not rosy in our immigration system but they remain in denial as regards their own responsibilities. You would swear they were commentators walking down the street just giving their opinion. Having spent years at the heart of government, they have overseen the sorry state of the system.

For an immigration system to work, to have a proper managed system, for it to be truly fair to all involved, to economic migrants, asylum seekers and our citizens alike, the rules must be fair, and most importantly, they need to be enforced. The failure of Government that I have just described is not acceptable. Decisions are taking far too long. There is not proper oversight when applications are refused. That is not acceptable to people fleeing war and persecution. Nor is it acceptable to those who are here and are rejected when they have families and have built up networks, friends and so on. There has to be a proper system that is enforced and greatly speeded up.",

The Government has rejected time and time again Sinn Féin's call for a full review of this. The Comptroller and Auditor General has told the Minister that there needs to be a root-and-branch review and still we get no action from the Government. It is protecting a profit system that hurts those in the system and ignores communities.",

Donegal is one of the most deprived counties on the island of Ireland. That is what the statistics tell us, yet per head of population Donegal has the highest number of IPAS centres and individuals availing of that service and the largest number of Ukrainians as well. That is just a badly managed system. We have made it clear that the Government's approach is not working, yet it refuses to listen.

It gives me no pleasure to say it, but the events of the past two weeks show that template is in tatters. The community of Saggart and the surrounding areas of Citywest and Rathcoole are strong, vibrant, diverse communities. People are generous and welcoming and have been going above and beyond to do the right thing during recent times. It is also important to acknowledge that inside Citywest itself there are men seeking international protection and Ukrainian families with children receiving temporary protection.

Decisions are not being made, investment is not taking place, and reasonable requests by the local community for increased investment, Garda resources, community safety, education, health facilities and supports for people in the community as well as for those in accommodation provided through the Department are simply not forthcoming. In fact, at most of the meetings, key decision-makers who can make decisions on these matters are not even in the room. As a consequence of that, before the savage assault on the young child a number of weeks ago and the nights of serious and unacceptable disorder on the streets of Saggart, the community was telling us they had a problem. Now, they are telling us they are fearful and angry and feel let down.

Again, it has made appeals around Garda resources and opening times for Garda stations, key amenities in terms of health facilities, school places and school transport, addressing the very real concerns around issues of community safety and supporting both the host community and those who are living there in IPAS accommodation to get through these issues."

                "Half of my mother's family emigrated in the 1950s. We know how this works. In many ways, we know better than any race how this works. As the Minister outlined in his opening statement, we spent generations as migrants. Over the past number of years, we have obviously had to deal with this subject matter. We are not dealing with it very well in some cases, particularly in the past few years.",
                "When we talk about defining the issues here, we have to discuss migration as a whole. This is a really pertinent and defining moment for our country. We are not really into extremes yet in this country, and that is a good thing, but we are in danger of changing as a country. The extreme views I am seeing across many different media formats out in the open in relation to a very small minority of people are very un-Irish. They are wrong. This is going to kill off forever Ireland of the welcomes. That is what we are known for.",
                "International protection is only a small percentage of migration into this country - it is approximately 10% to 12%. We all know there have been decreases in relation to volume and, I understand, in the number of people being passed after appeal. The Minister said the majority of applicants are refused and he is right. The figure is approximately 58.4%. Some 40% are accepted. If I was Minister, the one thing I would do immediately is do a public awareness and support campaign for migrants into this country. Without them, this country would simply stop. I spent two years in the hospitals visiting my parents. Without migrants the health system in this country would stop. Across a whole range of other sectors, it would stop.",
                "Will the Minister do a positivity campaign about migration to this country and the fact it is good that we are bringing these people into this country, that we need all these workers and that our health and care services would collapse without them? Let us call a spade a spade because many people will not say this. There are jobs in this country Irish people will not do anymore and we need people to supply services in our country. It is a good problem. That is outside the diversity, good social values and everything else that comes in from the mix of people arriving into our country and contributing.",
                "I have two kids in secondary school. Some of their best friends come from migrant communities. I see what is going around. I come from outside the town of Nenagh, which is one of the wealthiest towns in Ireland. It is doing very well. That is why we have so many migrants; we need the workers. The contribution they make is incredible and yet we focus in on a small percentage of them in relation to international protection, a considerable number of whom come to this country for proper reasons, considering they are allowed to stay.",
                "We talk about the small number of people who end up getting deported. Dare I say it but I have no issue with that. If you deserve to be deported, you should be deported. I believe in a rules-based system. I am not going to argue about that. I would argue about that if processing takes too long, particularly where children are involved, we are going to have to look at some exemptions. Does the Minister know why? In 2019 before the last general election, I was one of the few public representatives - in fact, I was the only TD - who stood up in relation to dealing with the issues in Borrisokane. People were fighting, arguing and worried about the number of people coming into Borrisokane.",
                "There is a far-right element across this country and the Minister’s Department is very concerned about it. The Minister’s Department did a deal with the people of Borrisokane. The people of Borrisokane, who I am so proud to represent, honoured that deal. All of those people settled in Borrisokane, so much so as the Minister probably knows, that more than a year and a half ago, we had public meetings because they were being moved, including some 40 young children running up the street with their hurlies. We do not really play Gaelic football in Tipperary, although they play a little bit in Borrisokane. Those children were running up the street in their Borrisokane colours and now they were being moved. The same people who were going to block the entrance to the asylum centre four years previously were now going to block it to keep them in. That is the impact the people who arrived in Borrisokane had on the wider community. There was a large March through the town where I had to support them again because I will be consistent on this issue.",
                "When we talk about migration, we need to be positive about it. Everybody needs to be positive about it. I am very concerned about the three largest parties in this country and what they have been saying offline, online, in here, out of here and in every other way. I am talking about Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Sinn Féin. Some of the commentary has been unacceptable. They have been trying to ride both horses. On the one hand, they want to be pro-migration while on the other hand, they make remarks which are totally unacceptable.",
                "We nearly had a catastrophic event recently in Drogheda. Can the Ceann Comhairle imagine what would have happened if that had turned into a tragedy? What would have happened in this House then? Where would we have been going? What would the people have demanded then? What would the narrative have been? Dare I bloody say it but where would all the keyboard warriors be then - these anonymous, faceless thugs and cowards? We missed out narrowly but thankfully on that tragedy. We all know about the events in Citywest two weeks ago.",
                "The reality is that one in five of all our workers - and the percentage is narrowing - is not originally from Ireland. We need these workers and we need to promote the benefits of such workers. I believe much of the political commentary recently has been diversionary in nature and it is absolutely horrendous. There are issues in relation to processing. There have been improvements, and I say that from an Opposition point of view to be balanced. However, there are also real, significant issues in relation to it still. The Minister has acknowledged the geographical distribution of IPAS centres needs to change. I dealt with an issue in my hometown of Roscrea where the last hotel was taken out for an IPAS centre. That is absolutely bloody stupid. Whoever made the decision in Dublin, oh my God. Talk about turning community against it, and those people in Roscrea had, in fairness, taken in many people before that. Those are the types of decisions that are ridiculous.",
                "We all know about the use of private facilities and how people are becoming so wealthy out of it. As the Labour Party has said through our strategy - and we are the only party that has published a strategy in relation to migration - we need to have publicly-funded infrastructure. We need to develop it quickly. There are real issues and they have to be dealt with.",
                "We also need to ensure we look at how information is being distributed. We had a fairly significant issue in Roscrea again recently. There was a carjacking. It was automatically assumed that the perpetrator - and I understand somebody is in court, so I will not say anymore – was possibly from the locality. This is going on all the time everywhere around the country. Public representatives in some cases are as bad as everyone else.",
                "As a society, we need to change the narrative and change the dial on this. Will the Minister put in a positive campaign on migration? If he is to take on one suggestion from this House tonight, he might take that on.",
                "I would like to look at how we will integrate into a European plan. If somebody is denied asylum in one country, how do we deal with it here? We have never discussed that fully in this House.",
                "I would like to look at the issue of assessments. Obviously there is the issue in relation to bringing them down but, as regards appeals, how can that be streamlined even further? I believe in quick assessments, once they are done properly. I note the Minister and Government are changing in relation to those in IPAS making a contribution towards their accommodation. In principle, I do not have an issue with this; the problem is the quality of the accommodation in some instances. Would you be asking people to pay for it? I doubt it. Second, this will cost more than it will take in. Is it not symbolic rather than real? Third, we all know you cannot really chase the people involved for the funding, so why do it?",
                "We need a pathway and plan for those who are successful in naturalisation and migration. We should put a plan in place around English and Irish language learning, civics and everything else for those successful in their processing. That whole space has been let go but it is really necessary.",
                "I will conclude by reading something sent to me by a lady in my hometown of Nenagh in relation to a club of which she is a member. I will not name her but it is a club that helps children with autism. She said she has stood with the club, supported it and recognises it. She wrote:",
                "I ask you to recognise that within our membership we have autistic children from refugee families and autistic children of immigrants, and that they face complex and multiple struggles in their daily lives.",
                "These children and their families are well aware of the growing racist discourse in public forums. They feel targetted, visible and afraid. They see comments on local Facebook groups, hear people saying the most awful things on programmes [on a radio show I will not mention] that are unavoidable in settings like GP surgery waiting rooms or small businesses. These extremist voices are boosted for being 'click-worthy' or creating debate. Unfortunately, the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice have both contributed inflammatory public comments after the attack in Drogheda this week.",
                "I am very privileged to be a white Irish woman in my own country, but as the child of returned emigrants, a returned emigrant myself, and as the wife of an immigrant, I feel the fears of growing xenophobia acutely. As the mother of autistic children, I am deeply concerned how racism affects the families in our club.",
                "My request to you is please to not mistake anti-immigrant noise for the sentiments of the vast majority of Tipperary people, who are generous, kind and tolerant. Most of us recognise that our rural schools and communities have been revived and enriched by newcomers over the past [20] years or so. Please continue to work for the good of our communities as a whole without scapegoating minority groups who are powerless to bring about change. Harm against one of us harms us all.",
                "I was very taken aback by that. The small number of people who are so deeply affected need to be in the forefront of our minds from now on. Second, we need a positive campaign on the benefits of migration."

                "Migration, when managed well and planned well, works well. We see that in the people who staff our hospitals and care homes, those working on our building sites and buses, in our restaurants and hotels and across the local services we all depend on, and in entrepreneurs running businesses and employing people in our communities. I am truly grateful for the contributions many of those people make to our society, communities and economy every day. I am also very conscious that some people who arrive here do not come by choice; they come because they are fleeing conflict, persecution or deep instability. They come here seeking shelter and safety.",
                "There is another truth people feel in their day-to-day lives. They feel that right now the pace and scale of migration is too fast in many communities. That is because services and decision-making have not kept up. As a result, confidence in the system's ability to keep up has been shaken. People want a process that is firm, fair and credible, and a system that acts quickly. If someone has a legal right to be here, the Department should make that decision quickly and support them to settle in well and contribute positively to society. Equally, if someone does not have the legal right to remain here, the State must act promptly and deport them. This is how rules-based systems work in any functioning democracy.",
                "I acknowledge the work under way by Government and the clear commitment, especially that shown in recent days and weeks, to strengthen our system, make it more efficient and ensure decisions are timely and fair. However, if we truly want to rebuild public trust and confidence in the system, we cannot just talk about national policies. We need to focus local because that is where policy becomes reality. Policy becomes real in communities, on people's doorsteps, in schools, in GP waiting rooms, on the street and in local facilities. That is where trust is built or lost. That is why we need to rethink what community engagement looks like in practice. It cannot just be treated as a procedural step. It is what makes or breaks a community’s trust in our system. Alongside clear decisions, we need real community investment and practical support on the ground.",
                "Take my own community, for example. In my own constituency of Dublin Mid-West, particularly in Saggart, but also in Lucan, Clondalkin, Brittas and Palmerstown, people have been decent and compassionate. These communities have been patient and they have been fair. They have done their part. They have more than stepped up. In return, they are asking for something very reasonable, which is for the State to step up too. They want clear communication, proper planning and services that keep pace with population growth - joined-up policy. They know better than any of us what the pressure points are and what supports are needed. We cannot just ask for their feedback and ideas; we need to act on it and respond to it.",
                "Before and since the horrific alleged assault on a young girl in Citywest and the outbreak of deplorable violence, I have been out speaking with local people, business owners and services providers in Saggart. I hear their frustration, worry and upset but I also hear their compassion. The people I speak to do not want division or labels. They just want fairness and information and that is the very least they deserve.",
                "For months I have been raising with the Minister the need for permanent gardaí for Citywest and Saggart. I have raised the need for stronger local supports and I have been working closely with the Minister's engagement team. I have had meeting after meeting and call after call. I have met with residents groups on the ground and brought their feedback to more meetings and calls. Now we need to respond and take action. We need a permanent increase in Garda visibility in Saggart and Citywest, as Councillor Shirley O'Hara and I have continued to advocate for. We need investment in amenities like St. Mary's. We need to make sure resources move in line with population growth. We do not have enough public health nurses or SNAs in the area. We do not have any youth service. Those are the kind of real services we could deliver in order to keep up with population growth. That is what the residents, businesses, education providers and sports clubs I engage with want. It is a very reasonable ask of the Saggart Village Residents Association. No one is asking for things they do not deserve or for special treatment; they are asking for what is fair and just.",
                "Local people were appalled and frightened by the violence and disruption brought to the community in recent weeks. They are still being impacted because the onsite gym and restaurant in Citywest remain closed on foot of Garda advice. Over 3,000 paid-up members are missing gym sessions. These are small things but they matter to people's quality of life and morale. People just want to be heard on this. We need trust in the system maintained."

From the beginning of this process dealing with those that were coming to our country for protection or arriving here without their documentation or arriving here illegally, the Department did not respond in the way that it should. We have to acknowledge that. We have to say to communities that we were wrong in what we were attempting to do. They refused to respond to public representatives who were trying to assist the community to understand what was happening and to understand the policy and that is why I welcome the Minister's opening remarks in how he set out and explained the difference between temporary protection, international protection and those who are coming here to work and stay and contribute to our economy. That needs to be said more often and we need to take the appropriate actions to support that.",

When people come here on a visa and are working and they ask for their wife or family to come to join them where they are economically sound and can support them, I do not know why they have to wait for a year or two years for that to be processed. I do not understand it. I do not understand why applications to the Department of justice take so long in the context of reaching a decision where a person is either legal or is not legal and must leave the country. Until we get to that point where we have clear systems and we have a clear understanding with the electorate, the people whom we represent and the communities that we are trying to support, we will have ongoing serious problems.",

                "It is important today that we do not conflate the asylum seeker system with the overall question of migration. Today's debate is on the international protection system and the policy implications thereof. Core to this debate, as stated in the programme for Government, is the move towards State-owned and State-managed accommodation for those seeking international protection. The point I have made previously in meetings with Ministers and other colleagues around this House is that we are at a stage where we can design a blueprint for community engagement around the construction of what will become permanent facilities up and down the country. One such facility that has been purchased by the State is Citywest, in my constituency, which would have been a strong local amenity for the communities that lived in the Saggart, Rathcoole and Newcastle areas.",
                "The Minister of State, Deputy Higgins, alluded to, and other Deputies mentioned, the blueprint for how we have advanced the purchase of that particular facility and for the recognition of the additional burden that it will put on the communities around it. When I use the word \"burden\", I am not casting aspersions on anyone; I am talking about sheer facts. In the 2022 census, there were almost 19,000 people in the Rathcoole, Saggart and Newcastle areas, an increase of 32% since 2016. We are three years ahead of the projections set in 2022. We are at the 2028 level of population in Newcastle, Rathcoole and Saggart and that does not take account of the additional residents that we put in the Citywest centre as well. That is part of the underpinning assumption that we need to have when we are talking about community engagement and the pressure that is put on services and nobody needs me to tell that the areas of Rathcoole, Saggart and Newcastle, like many areas in Dublin Mid-West, have been behind in the provision of services. For example, a Garda sub-district in Dublin Mid-West, Ronanstown, has a similar population to Rathcoole, Saggart and Newcastle and these areas would justify a full Garda sub-district. This is something I have been arguing for since being elected and have been doubling down on since the purchase of Citywest as well not because there is necessarily a correlation between crime and the number of asylum seekers, but because of the sheer number of people that are in that area and putting more residents in place there as well.",
                "We have heard mention of public health nurses. We have heard calls for investment in amenities and green space that were at breaking point in areas such as Citywest previously. That is why community engagement needs to be more than a tick-box exercise with regards to saying we have met people, we have heard their feedback but there has not been any action on it. We need to show action in these places. We need to show recognition of the fact that we are making a good life and an integrated community for all people there and fundamental to that is the integrity of the asylum system, giving people an insight into what goes on in IPAS centres or the training facilities put in place for people who have been successful in their applications. Are we providing them with the skills that they need to live successfully in our country? Are we providing them with the language skills? These are questions that we need to ask and we need to look at how are providing the training and how are we putting these facilities in place to support these people in their journeys here, and ultimately how are we underpinning the community integration funds that we need to integrate these communities.",
                "We have a lot of lessons to learn from the past few months. I look forward to working with the Minister to ensure that those lessons are learned from and we work for our communities."

In fact, it is the opposite. The median waiting time has increased from ten months to nearly 13 months this year, up to the end of September. The Minister is saying one thing but the opposite is true. He also made a charge that has been repeated by any number of Government backbenchers and that Ministers have taken to the media over the last six months: \"My overall strategy for the international protection process, aimed at making more and faster decisions, is working. From the beginning of my tenure as Minister [for justice], applications for asylum have decreased by [approximately] 40%.\" Is the Minister seriously trying to tell me that because he tweets about deportation flights, somebody in some far-off location, who is considering coming here to seek asylum, will say that the Minister has now tweeted so they will not come here? He should pull the other one because it is just a joke that continues to be allowed to percolate.",

As I engage with this debate, because we want it to be reasonable and have asked for it to be facts-based, we should use the Tánaiste's own lines and words and deconstruct them as we go. He said that people on the left are trying to shut down the debate. That is far from the case. We just understand the stakes and that it needs to be facts-based when we debate. The Tánaiste said that those of us who advocate for compassion, fairness and a facts-based discussion, are trying to shut down debate. What he actually means is we are refusing to nod along to misinformation. There has been no shortage of debate, be it in the media, the House or the committee chamber. We looked at the international protection Bill 2025 for over seven hours without much in the way of Government contribution, and nothing in the way of actual scrutiny, because the heads of Bill are still not even in place for most of the outstanding issues. When the Tánaiste says the debate is being shut down, he is not defending free speech. He is defending poor speech, speech that confuses facts, blames the wrong people and hides his own failures. That is the issue here because far-right actors and, believe me, there are far-right actors, do not win when they get the type of people who would like to see impositions of power. They do not win electoral seats. They win when nice middle-class people, with nice respectable-looking suits, start wearing their clothes and echoing their calls.

The Central Statistics Office tells us that immigration to Ireland actually fell by 16% in the year to April 2025. A total of 125,000 people came to Ireland and 65,000 people left. That is a net migration of 59,700, which should be a perfectly manageable number for a country of 5.46 million people. What is more, half of those arrivals were aged between 25 and 44, who are working-age adults filling vital gaps in the labour market. When the Tánaiste said that numbers are too high, he is not describing reality. He is trying to turn a story of economic growth and workforce needs into one of threat and crisis potentially because his back is against the wall.",

Okay, let us consider it. People have a right to seek asylum. It is natural many of them will not be successful. That is okay. People have that right. We do not get to control that. The presidential election was fought over who was more pro- or less pro-European Union. If that is what is being complained about, we have signed up to international agreements and if you want to deconstruct them, maybe you should revisit your belief system.",

Detention already exists under section 5 of the Immigration Act 1999. It allows for detention for up to 56 days extendable only by court order. We have detentions in prisons at the moment but our prison system is operating at 124% capacity. Is Fine Gael, the party of law and order, telling us that those people with outstanding deportations hanging over them should go into the prison system to increase that percentage? Will we see what we saw for example in Limerick last year when people who had committed actual crimes were released from prison so that we could detain people who had committed no crime? That is the extent of what the Tánaiste said. These are the debates we need to go into.",

That was outlined as if both of them sat down and came to this determination just by themselves in a room presumably without any evidence basis or business case. Even the Government's own memo on this policy tells us it will cost €1.6 million to set it up and deliver a low-rate return. It even admits major difficulties in enforcement and recovery. There is no evidence of contribution models with high compliance rates in any EU member state. It just weakens one of the pull factors attracting international protection applicants to Ireland. This is the performative cruelty idea that people present as reasonable. Of course, perhaps the people in a position to pay could do so. However, when the Minister and the Minister of State were in that room deciding this policy without any evidence, did they consider that these working people might also have childcare and afterschool needs? They might want to put themselves in a position where they could save for the deposit for rent to try get some accommodation in a failed housing market that they did not create but are now being blamed for.",

In 2024, the Government issued 38,189 employment permits, the highest number ever with over 32,000 new permits and 5,700 renewals. I am sorry that the Minister of State, Deputy Higgins, just left the Chamber because she put out a strong press release talking about the fact that we need migration in this country because we are operating at such low levels of unemployment. However, the Tánaiste did not say that. He just simply said that migration at all levels is too high, whistling a little bit for somebody to hear, but when you break it down-----"

For ten years before becoming a TD, I worked in human rights and equality and for the second half of that decade, international protection was my primary focus. I find it incredible to listen to the statements from Government representatives here today calling for action on certain elements of our international protection system when they are part of a series of governments which, term after term over the last three decades, have overseen an absolutely shambolic approach to international protection. We had direct provision for two decades where people had barely enough means to live on. The Government had to be dragged kicking and screaming to provide for basic rights like the right to work and the right to access a driving licence which would allow people within the system to integrate into Irish society.",

Now we are at the point where the Government is openly saying that it wants to address the pull factor and does not want to attract applications from people for international protection. That is a direct denial of the right to claim asylum and it is a direct denial of the reality that 130 million people on this globe are displaced and need help. If, across the European Continent, we are in a race to the bottom to deny that right to claim asylum for people across the rest of the globe, we are on the wrong side of history.",

People are hurting. People are being devastated every day by the housing crisis. In my constituency, from Ballymun to Beaumont, I meet people who are really struggling. Ministers are dog-whistling in saying that all the immigrants and asylum seekers are to blame because we have messed up so badly. It is the Government's failures. It is disgraceful that Ministers have turned and dog-whistled, and are blaming immigrants, because the real cause of the housing crisis is their failures. Why are they not calling out the Irish landlords who are evicting people into homelessness? Why are they not talking about the 100,000 vacant and derelict homes?

Significant numbers have left our shores for hundreds of years, and no one is more aware of it than ourselves. In the last century and this one, much of our economy was built on money received from those who went to America and their children who came after them, who still support the people here. We know how difficult it is and we sympathise instinctively with those who have to come here, but at the same time we have to address concerns where they arise. Vast numbers of people in this State have concerns about how their money is spent and who it is given to. We know that €1.2 billion was spent on IPAS centres last year. We also know that only a small number of third-party providers received most of that money. Some received up to €30 or €40 million. We need to ask questions about that.",

We need to continue to ask questions in this regard because, ultimately, as we were told by the Secretary General of the Department of justice, 80% of people who come to this country fail to secure residency. Deputy Nash questioned that number but that is the one that was stated to us. Other numbers have been issued since, but at the same time, the percentage given at the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts last week was indeed 80%. Ultimately, if 80% of those who go through the process are not entitled to be here, we must question the system that allows it. We have a neighbour with which we share a border and many seem to be coming over it. In the past, people arriving at our airports were ripping up their passports. We have to stop that and question it, because if we do not we will not be serving the best interests not only of those who elect us but also others in the State who deserve our full support in many different ways. If people are arriving through the UK and have not sought asylum there, we must ask why. I do not want to use any term that might be misconstrued, but is this State seen as a place where they feel they might have a better chance of gaining asylum? If so, we must ask why it might be the case.",

We need a system that works better and more quickly and that ultimately gets decisions made. If people are not entitled to be here, so be it. People will have to know that when they come here, they will have a limited opportunity, or otherwise, to stay here.",

The State has used places – such as Ryevale House near me – where there was no proper planning permission or water resources, and no proper education provided for the people. I would question the Department and seek to continue to ensure that we do so."

They have tightened their systems, sped up decisions and focused support on those who genuinely need protection. Ireland is now mirroring many of those same measures. We have started to cut processing times from years to months and increased voluntary returns to help people to go home safely and with dignity. We are moving towards State-owned accommodation, which offers better oversight and value for money than the private providers.",

Across the EU, new border procedures are being introduced so applications can be screened quickly for identity, security and eligibility before people enter the asylum system. France and Germany have already begun this and it is proving effective. Ireland should follow that model. A properly designed border screening process would mean that clear initial decisions could be made within days, not months. Those with strong claims could move swiftly into protection and integration, while those without grounds would receive a fair early decision and be supported to return home. This would reduce the backlog, cut costs and give the public confidence that the system is being managed properly.",

That shows that the system is being overwhelmed by unsuitable cases. People are waiting too long and communities are being left without clarity.",

If we want the Irish public to have confidence in immigration, then the immigration system must be one that deserves that confidence. We need a mature national conversation based on facts, not one where genuine concerns are dismissed as racism. We have to be honest when the State does not manage its borders effectively and when processes are slower and sow doubt.

In one year, two directors of Igo Cafe Limited, an accommodation provider, paid themselves €4.6 million. This is a company that has been one of the largest beneficiaries of State contracts.",

                "The failure of the Government to manage the migration process has led to an erosion of public confidence. This stems from a failure to manage the system but equally a failure to communicate with local communities. This has often being exploited by far-right agitators, often from outside of the State, to spread their fear and message of hate. Their distorted and xenophobic message must always be challenged. Local communities, where they have legitimate concerns, need to be listened to. Our IPAS system must be fair for both our citizens and those seeking international protection. The Ukrainian accommodation recognition payment contributes to the belief that things are not equal.",

Unfortunately, the past week offers little evidence that he means what he says. We need a reset on our public discourse on migration and that starts with all of us in this House and with our leaders in government. For a rationale debate, we need to make appeals to truth, not fears. For a calm debate, we need to stop exaggerating, misrepresenting and facilitating the endless conveyer belt of online lies which too often end up in diluted form on the floor of this House. For an informed debate, we must speak only to facts. The Tánaiste bulldozed through each of these three last week. He did so purposefully. He chose his words carefully. He knew the effect they would have on the ears that heard their fears reflected back to them and he knew the debate it would trigger. It contrasted so much with the thoughtful, rationale contribution from the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, in his article in yesterday’s edition of The Irish Times.",

Following this, last Thursday, in an interview with Claire Byrne, the Taoiseach declared that it was a mistake to have taken migration responsibility out of the Department of justice. Except that never happened. The Department of justice has always had responsibility for all aspects of our border and who enters our country. Responsibility for issuing visas remained with the Department of justice. Responsibility for the Garda National Immigration Bureau, the International Protection Office and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal all remained with the Department of justice. Responsibility for policy on employment permits remained with the then Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The only thing that was taken out of the Department of justice was responsibility for accommodating people fleeing here, either through international protection or subsequently through temporary protection for those fleeing the war in Ukraine. This effort by the Taoiseach to rewrite history is not the leadership that we need.",

The Government must lead on protecting people who are vulnerable, on standing up to hatred, whether it is on our streets or in the online space, and by combating misinformation with facts."

Simon Harris does a pivot again to the right and starts to scapegoat minorities in this country, something he has done before. I am not a bit surprised.

Many of the people are Ukrainian, and the Government was all for funding the war in Ukraine as well. We have a capitalist system, to which the Government is wedded, that is bringing nothing but devastation and poverty. What does the Government do? It resorts to increasing racism itself. Misogyny, homophobia and all of that is being resorted to by Trump and it looks like the Government is following suit.

This is somebody who was working in a Deputy's office in these Houses and we are meant to pretend that they did not know he was a racist. He was an absolute fascist. Independent Ireland has been putting up stuff. It is disappointing that Sinn Féin is also there. If you do not point to the resources that exist in this society in a massively rich country with a huge budget surplus and huge number of vacant properties and all you do is attack the IPAS system, you are not actually tackling the far right.

I counted no fewer than seven times when Jack Chambers, stepping in for the Taoiseach, called for a debate on our migration policy. This is kind of the last refuge of the scoundrel. Rather than actually coming out and arguing for a position, they just say we need to have a debate about it, suggesting that somehow they are not able to have a debate. They are able to have a debate; they are the Ministers responsible for Government policy. It has become clear that what the Government wants is not a debate. What it wants is a free run to engage in dog-whistling and in scapegoating of asylum seekers and for that not to be challenged. Simon Harris was deliberately conflating migration numbers in general with a small number of asylum seekers who had not been deported. When Fintan O'Toole very accurately and precisely skewered that and exposed the misinformation that Simon Harris was engaged in, and when that was then echoed and emphasised by some Opposition parties, the response by Simon Harris to this debate happening was to accuse us of shutting down debate. The debate is not just that you get to say whatever you want or that you get to throw out your dog-whistles and not be challenged on it. You will be challenged on it.",

The idea, as it was suggested by a Fianna Fáil TD, that by doing so they will cut across the rise of the far right and that this is what the evidence across Europe shows is ridiculous. All the evidence shows that as the establishment moves to the right, it reinforces the rhetoric and analyses of the far right. It simply gives them more and more space because the establishment cedes ground to them. Fintan O'Toole was absolutely correct in analysing why this is happening:",

We got the grim answer in the run-up to the local elections, where Sinn Féin deserves a fell-for-it award where it tried to compete in being more anti-immigrant than the Government, which resulted in a disastrous election for Sinn Féin because it all became about immigration. The Government earlier stated that it was overrun at that stage and that the result was that people were on the canal. That is not what happened. That is not true. There were empty beds in the system. The Government chose to put people on the canal because it wanted to make people homeless in order to centre the issue of immigration and say that was the problem. It is all an incredible distraction technique to make people think that the problems in our society, the housing crisis, the health crisis and the cost-of-living crisis and the causes of those problems are not those at the top, those who profit from those crises, not the Government that represents those forces that profit, but the most vulnerable people.",
                "The latest act of performative cruelty or suggestion, which is being trailed again and again, is the idea that the Government is going to charge people who are working for staying in IPAS accommodation. It is presented as just common sense. Why would people not be paying? Well, one reason might be that it is going to cost more to implement than the Government will raise. There is also a very good reason that we do not charge people who stay in, for example, emergency accommodation. We want them to actually get out of emergency accommodation. The Government is going to keep people in poverty in these systems just so it can have some performative cruelty. This is the thin end of the wedge. If the Government gets away with doing this for asylum seekers in their emergency accommodation, is it going to do the same for homeless people? Is the Government going to use that horrendous attack? If it sets up the system, spends millions of euros on it and establishes the principle that if people work while in State-provided accommodation they should pay, then all homeless people will be next. That is why we must stand against this divisive policy."

Through September of this year, the total number of applicants had reduced by 38.5%. In addition, enforcement had significantly stepped up, with an increase of 105% on the same period in 2024. However, while this progress is being made, it is important that we recognise, and indeed challenge, the increasingly hostile online commentary that has grown up regarding immigration in Ireland. The claim that migrants coming to Ireland are unvetted is entirely false. All international protection applicants have their fingerprints and photographs taken and these are checked against EU databases. Of course, we must also recognise there are many communities throughout the country who have legitimate concerns about migration, which we must address by having sensible, honest and rational discussions with local communities.",

That is why the Government is bringing forward the international protection Bill. This new legislation will bring important changes, which will streamline the decisions process, as well as the returns process, and will provide new institutional arrangements for international protection decisions and appeals.",

It is important that centres are not all located in one area, or that small towns and villages do not have very high numbers. In my own county of Wicklow, the majority of IPAS centres and numbers of people seeking international protection are located in one municipal district, namely, west Wicklow. This district is also the most poorly served by public transport and services. Above all, these measures should be introduced quickly. One of the main issues I have seen since I entered the Dáil is how slowly things move. The world out there moves quickly. Government action and the action of relevant public servants must move much more quickly and reflect the realities on the ground. We see this in infrastructure delivery. These delays are causing hardship for those involved and costing the taxpayer hundreds of million of euros.",

It is clear that significant reform is needed. I hope we can move forward in delivering that reform with compassion and fairness. It is worth noting that since the Minister has taken office, there has been a 40% reduction in the numbers of people arriving here and that is a testament to that robust system the Minister is trying to enforce."

It was the first time ever that we had nine people from a certain ethnic community come to a clinic and say they fear for themselves and the community they live in. I had never heard that before.

I also welcomed his suggestion during the week that if someone is staying in an accommodation centre and earning a salary, which people are allowed to do after a six- or eight-week period, they should rightly be paying for that because every other person in this country, be they accommodated in emergency accommodation, social housing or any form of accommodation, pays a contribution that is appropriate and equal to what they are able to pay.",

Lisdoonvarna in County Clare, more than any town in Ireland, has played a role. Its population has increased fourfold during the past two and a half years and yet the Government and agencies of the Government did not backfill that with fourfold support. It is also important to note that schools very quickly played a major supporting role and welcomed young children into their classrooms, but now as those children have moved on to other accommodation centres, those schools are being told by the Minister for education that their enrolment on 30 September dropped by two or three pupils so a teacher will be taken from them. We should show the same good spirit to those schools that they showed to the little children who arrived at their front door because it has to work both ways.",

Who better to pick on than people who are voiceless and, crucially, poor, such as asylum seekers? In my constituency, we admired people such as Mike Quill from Kerry, a union leader in New York who always preached an anti-racist message. He said that if blacks and Jews were good enough to fight and die beside, they were good enough to live beside and work beside also.

The events in Drogheda over the weekend were deeply disturbing and there is absolutely no place in this country for such behaviour, no matter who owns the building. Let us be honest, however, that condemning violence is only part of the conversation. We must also confront the systematic failure in our immigration system. These failures are causing real harm to decent and law abiding people. Let us consider the South African man I am helping. He travelled from Mizen Head to Dublin today without an appointment and desperate to secure a visa for his wife. He has been waiting since March. He is a respected member of my community and his story is not unique. It is emblematic of a system that is failing. In Bandon there is a man who is married to an Irish citizen. He is still waiting for a visa despite having a ten-week-old baby. In Clonakilty another man is trying to reunite with his Brazilian partner who was forced to leave the country due to the delays in securing a de facto visa. These are people who contribute to our communities and who are trying to do things the right way, yet they are met with bureaucratic indifference and endless obstacles. Meanwhile we have IPAS centres housing individuals with deportation orders. Serious questions remain unanswered about how non-residents, including vulnerable children in Tusla care, ended up being assaulted by a resident of the Citywest campus. The Minister's reply to my parliamentary questions confirmed that around 500 people who are subject to deportation orders are currently residing in IPAS centre accommodation. This is not just a policy failure; this is a safeguarding crisis. Let me say something that some seem to be afraid to say: I do not believe it is wrong to take care of our own people first. What is so controversial about that? We have over 16,000 people homeless in this country. Where is the help for them? When we are passengers on an airplane, we are told that in the case of an emergency we must put on our own oxygen masks first before helping others. That is not selfish; that is common sense."

It is quite incredible to be sitting here listening to an immigration debate with comments by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael TDs that they would have been called racist just a year ago. Where was the critical thinking then? Where was the independent thought a year or two years ago? It is amazing to hear Government Members raising concerns and talking about a firm and fair immigration system. This is something we spoke about for a very long time and for which we were condemned by the Government. I am glad that the Tánaiste has made a U-turn and finally allowed some common sense and critical thinking into this debate. It is ironic that the Government is condemning the Social Democrats and the Labour Party for trying to censor debate, which I believe is wrong, which the Government engaged in just a few months ago. It is important that I welcome the Minister of State to the side of common sense, to critical thinking and, indeed, to law and order.",

There has been abuse by way of the destruction of travel documents, which the Government has done nothing about because it is incapable even of having a rational discussion on the topic. This is something that could easily have been solved but a discussion on it in the House was refused. The situation of economic migrants using and abusing the IPAS system should have been addressed several years ago. Another abuse is the fact the Government has taken over the last remaining hotel in so many towns and villages. We have deportation orders that are never enforced. In fact, last year, more than 2,500 deportation orders were issued and just over 100, or less than 5%, were enforced. That is the reality but one would not think so from listening to Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael TDs this evening. That is not to mention the utter abuse of taxpayers' money associated with the IPAS system. The Comptroller and Auditor General's report outlined a litany of such abuse, including more than €7.5 million wrongly being charged on VAT.",

It is crucial that it now implements rational steps that seek to improve the situation and address the chaos over which it has presided."

Unfortunately, a previous speaker has left the Chamber. There are a couple of points I would have liked to respond to but perhaps that is for another day. The Minister of State will understand if I focus my comments locally or parochially on Citywest. Some of the points I will make could already be subject to action by the Minister, the Minister of State and the Department.

Some of the concerns may be groundless but I will outline them in any case. There is concern that the current staff lack appropriate training in essential areas, including conflict resolution, Children First and child protection protocols, trauma-informed practices, human trafficking awareness and general social care and protection standards. Question marks have been raised around accountability structures reaching down to security staff. The Citywest complex, as the Minister of State knows well, hosts at least three distinct centres. There is what we would have known as the golf hotel, with 300 or 400 rooms. I understand it is still housing refugees but it is separate from the Citywest facility. The Citywest hotel houses more than 1,000 Ukrainians and then the leisure centre, or the gym as it would be known locally, has 30,000 sq. ft of accommodation. The convention centre is over 250,000 sq. ft in size and the hotel has 750 beds. It is a big operation.",
                "One of the things we need to do now we own a significant portion of this facility is sit down and review how it is governed and managed from security right down to welfare. Concerns have arisen regarding security and access control. One of the suggestions made to me is that we need tighter control of access points and consideration of enhanced security measures such as the use of drug detection dogs. There are claims of open drug dealing on the site. Use of facial recognition technology has also been suggested. That is standard practice in some other IPAS centres and involves a swipe in-swipe out system. It does not contravene anybody's rights; it just protects the place properly. It has been proposed that there be a review of and greater emphasis on monitoring and accountability. I am not talking here about the Ukrainians living in the State. I refer to those seeking international protection and who must remain on site until they attain that. The site is not a prison but it is a holding centre for people in that sense. There have been calls for a focus on social cohesion within the site and off-site and on residents' well-being. There is a mix. I volunteered there for a little while. What I did was a microcosm of what other volunteers in south County Dublin did. However, I was there just as things started to get a little more complex and it was not just Ukrainians being housed there. I wrote a little paper on what I saw, which I will forward to the Minister of State. My time is up. Those are just some of the concerns that have been raised locally. I know the Minister of State is aware of them."

In discussing migration, we must acknowledge it is a complex social phenomenon. There are different forms of migration. It brings obvious benefits to our economy, healthcare system and cultural life but it also presents new demands. Given the issue's complexity, the public expects that we, as its representatives in this House, will discuss challenges for the systems we use to manage migration. I fear we are falling disappointingly short of the public's expectations. To state these two things that are obviously true should not be controversial.

Arguments should always be considered on their merits and on the strength of evidence in support of them. Ideological dogma should never take precedence over constructive debate. It is disgraceful that some parties in this Chamber have chosen to engage in dangerous and divisive culture war politics. The bad faith arguments, closer to innuendo, put forward by some of the Opposition have been nothing short of remarkable. As a former Lord Mayor of Dublin, I am incredibly proud that one in five people living in Dublin city is not originally from Ireland. That adds to the vibrancy of our city and makes it international.

There is not a reasoned space where we can actually debate the real issues here and suggest what can be done. There are definitely legitimate criticisms that can be made of the Department and the manner in which it manages IPAS. For example, there is consistently an information vacuum. There seems to be a decision made within the Department that it will not trust members of communities in local areas. They do not actually trust them to give the information well in advance so they actually know what is happening in their area. People are entitled to know what is happening in their area. They are not entitled to veto it. Nobody gets to decide who lives next door to them but in the absence of information from the Department, other people fill that vacuum with misinformation.",

When he said there was too much migration into the country, there is justification for that comment. The reality is that 80% of people who come here and apply for international protection are found not to be entitled to it and are therefore the subject of a return to the country they came from. Migration is down 47% in 2025 compared to 2024. Still more than 16,000 people have come here this year. That is still a major problem because it creates huge pressure on the system. Let us not accuse people of misinformation when they have in fact stated facts. Let us allow people have space to debate it in a reasoned way that allows them to actually look at the real issues."

                "As every Member today has done, I condemn the barbaric events at Citywest and, more recently, in Drogheda, County Louth. I want to express my gratitude to the members of An Garda Síochána and the emergency services for their swift actions. However, it should not have come to this. As I said on 18 September, there is a real risk to social cohesion if we do not put our house in order in a fair and humane manner as quickly as possible. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, and the Minister, Deputy O'Callaghan, for the detailed updates they provided to us this afternoon and the briefing document, which I skimmed through. I am grateful for that. There is probably a public relations piece in terms of the information given to us and getting that out into the wider community so that people are aware that huge efforts are being made by the international protection team and the ministerial team. However, as our population is increasing rapidly, I sought information previously on capacity audits in the areas of housing, healthcare, education and transport in order to determine in advance the services that are required for those who legitimately apply for and qualify for international protection supports but also for the communities that will host international protection applicants.",
                "The other area I queried previously is that of critical skills audits. That links in with the issuing of work permits. I am somewhat concerned that there may be a crossover between using an international protection application route disingenuously where a work permit application may be appropriate, albeit more timely and at a cost. It is possible that avenue is being used disingenuously. I wonder whether a critical skills audit is being carried out to determine sector by sector the number of migrant workers we require. I note that Brazil, Georgia and India were mentioned earlier as countries of origin. I am not sure whether that was for work permit applications or international protection. There are two countries in particular which have areas where their geography, geology and demographics are changing very rapidly because of large corporations moving in looking to increase output and productivity. Farmland is being taken over, populations are being moved to urban areas which are overpopulated and then people are forced to leave their country of origin. That links in to the climate piece as well. There is a much bigger picture here.",
                "Another concern is whether there are robust checking mechanisms in place with the Department of Social Protection. Perhaps reforms are needed there as well. Many small businesses in County Meath cite an unavailability of workers who will work more than 18.5 hours a week, so there are some issues there.",
                "I will point out some glaring surprises. It is unusual for ordinary people in my own area to raise flags with me on the issue of migration but two cases come to mind. The question has been voiced to me about how accommodation offers and expressions of interest can be fast-tracked for international protection applicants but previously they have not been sought nor offered for people who are on local authority housing lists. Another issue I would like to point out is, as of this evening, I can book a two-night break in the Hilton in Kyiv-----"

I too want to condemn the attack in Drogheda. Actions like that are totally reprehensible and cannot be condoned. Let me be absolutely clear: Ireland's international protection system is broken. The Tánaiste himself admitted that it is not working. The Taoiseach echoed that sentiment. They have been on some road to Damascus there. My goodness; I never saw anything like it. It is astonishing for those of us who have been calling out the broken system for almost three years now, including Deputy Carol Nolan, me and others, to hear these sentiments by the Government now. We have been abused, heckled and shouted down by all sides of this House, called racist and far right and accused of creating division or undermining social cohesion. Yet, here we are now. The Government has caught up with our understanding and concerns. Maybe the spoiled votes in the election had something to do with that. It is a bit late. As I said, it is a road to Damascus situation. The proof of the pudding will be in the eating. We will see by its actions.",
                "More than 80% of asylum claims are found to be false. That is not a system under pressure; it is a system being exploited shamefully. What is worse is that many individuals remain in Ireland even after receiving deportation orders. There is no accountability. This is totally unacceptable. I accept that deportation orders have increased. However, when a person has been ordered to leave, they must leave.",
                "Let us take the case of Tipperary. From top to bottom the céad míle fáilte in Tipperary is well known, from the top of Tipperary right down to Rathcabbin. What happened in Roscrea was appalling. It is appalling what is still going on in Dundrum House Hotel . Hearns Hotel in Clonmel and many other buildings were taken over. These were hotels that the economy depended on for tourism. Many local people were working in them. If you say anything you are told to be quiet. What is going on in Dundrum is absolutely shambolic. The Taoiseach was in Clonmel before the election to open the office of then Councillor Michael Murphy. He met Ms Crowe and Ms O'Dwyer who explained to him what is happening. He seemed to listen. Then they were decried and the riot squad was sent in. So much force was deployed on communities that were totally non-violent. Anybody who came there trying to create trouble was hunted. It was the same in Roscrea. The way An Garda Síochána was used was shocking. Now we are left in a heap in Roscrea. A section 5 is due for adjudication in the High Court which has gone on and on and deferred. Meanwhile, another section 5 has been submitted. Now the council has referred it to An Coimisiún Pleanála. We know what it is doing. It will facilitate the making of Dundrum House Hotel, leisure resort and golf course into an IPAS centre. That is being facilitated by the Minister and the Government. The nod and wink system is alive and well in big business. A lot of money is being paid to rogue developers who would not be interested in housing people. They are only interested in their póca, their pockets. We should cut the funding they are getting by two-thirds. Ordinary people will want to help asylum seekers, not greedy people who are not nice. The people who own that place in Drogheda are not nice either. A lot of investigation is needed into this. Books will be written about this and there will be huge investigations in years to come and we will have to hang our heads in shame. It is a broken system. The Government is only playing catch-up. I do not think it really wants to fix it."

When I was making notes for my closing remarks, I wrote that I would like to thank all of the Deputies who contributed to this important discussion. I said at the start that I hoped we would have a discussion that was balanced, fair and done in the right way. Most of the contributions were. We need to call a spade a spade. Some of the contributions veered towards an area which I find very worrying. They were contributions that were not fair, not necessarily in criticising the Government, but in terms of using tropes and language that should have no place in this type of debate.",
                "We have to acknowledge that debates on migration can be difficult. They will always provoke strong emotions. There are differing perspectives here. For the most part, we have seen how we can engage and talk about this issue. Respectful debate is the cornerstone of democracy, but I have to call out things when I think they are crazy or are tropes that are just thrown out. We had a Sinn Féin Deputy talk about deportations and border checks in his contribution. It would nearly make me laugh if it were not so serious - to have people in Sinn Féin wanting checks for people going across the Border. They should get real because the biggest border on our island is between North and South. Are they suggesting that we close the Border? There is talking out of both sides of your mouth, but that brings a new level of farce.",
                "I have to say I was disappointed with the contribution from the former Minister, Deputy O'Gorman. At a certain point, he went out of his way to list all of the things he was not responsible for. Unfortunately, one of the main things he was responsible for during that period in government was the IPAS accommodation system. We are sorting out the problems that came about during that period of time. Some of that was not his fault. Some of it was because of the huge influx that took place. I am willing to acknowledge that he was dealing with a very difficult situation, but we have to have reasonableness and respectfulness about it.",
                "We had contributions from Deputies, and in particular from the Social Democrats, none of whom are still here, in which they ranged their fire down on the Tánaiste from the high moral ground. If you want to be morally superior to others, you have an extra duty of care to make sure your contributions are careful and inclusive of everything. One line has constantly been taken out of remarks made by the Tánaiste. I am going to take a moment to read the bit that these Deputies seem so incapable of following it with. The Tánaiste stated:",
                "Let's be honest with people. We are developing a new migration policy here. We are developing a migration system and somewhat doing it in real time. I am very clear that immigration is a good thing. I am very clear that our country benefits from immigration. I am also very clear that immigration or migration into our country [is] lawful. I am very clear...",
                "At that point the Tánaiste gets interrupted. He came back to say that he thought this was the challenge with migration. When politicians get asked a question they do not have an opportunity to answer. He added that what he was trying to say was that migration was a good thing. He said that we needed to get a system where people have a right to stay here and are told that quickly and can get on with their lives and contribute positively to our country and to integrate. He went on to say that he was speaking honestly to the people of Ireland and we were not where we need to be. He said that we had a system that needs change. When people do not have a right to be here and have exhausted their right to be here, they should be deported quickly. If they cannot be deported for some logistical reason, they should at that moment be detained. He also said that we had to be honest with people because what people are seeing right across the country is that the numbers are simply too high and he wanted to acknowledge that.",
                "That is the totality of what the Tánaiste said and it is the totality of what the Minister, Deputy O'Callaghan, and I keep on trying to say. We need to be honest and inclusive in total about what we are saying about migration. Most people in this country who were not born in Ireland and who we see everyday are here because we have asked them here. They are here because they are providing essential services, keeping the health service going, building the houses that we need and working in hi-tech businesses. We have gone out and looked for them to contribute and build our society. They are paying the taxes that contribute to providing the social services that we need to provide, including pensions. We have an issue with international protection and it is what this debate was about. We need to be honest and truthful about that as well. Our international protection numbers were too high. They went from the low to the high thousands. That was unsustainable. I agree with the Deputies who talked about the billion euro bill for running international protection services. That is not sustainable, but if you want to make that point make the other point too, namely, that the migration pact, the International Protection Bill 2025 which we are bringing through the Houses, will take the processing time down to 12 weeks, including the appeal. That is what will really take the cost out of providing international protection services. It gives a firm, fast and fairer system, which is better for the people who are going through it and also for this State.",
                "While criticising the Government, one Deputy said that we should introduce a system that would take six months. We are introducing a system that will take 12 weeks. That is coming in next June. It is important that people make sure they are aware of the facts. As a Government, we want to see things change. The Minister and I are bringing this change through this Chamber and the Seanad, so we will have a new, better system. We want to see a system that is fair to everybody. We also want to recognise that Ireland has changed and that it is not going back to some version of non-reality that certain Deputies seem to think will happen.",
                "Many of the people here are not international protection applicants but the people who are building the modern Ireland. They are the people who playing in our GAA clubs, on the soccer pitches and with our kids in the school playground. Their parents are working flat out to build and supply the services we all need. That is the new Ireland. We need to be proud of that. When I left school in 1984, if you were lucky, you got into college for a few years. Even if you did, you still most likely left. We were the migrants. We went outward. The important thing is a good lot of us came back, and we should be proud of that fact. We now have people coming here because we have a country - and I acknowledge there are still problems - that in so many ways is successful, prosperous and has grown. We need those people. We should always remember that.",
                "As the political leaders in our country, we need to be willing to stand up and say that. At the same time, I will always respect people's right to say there are problems with the system or that the Government has got it wrong on a certain point. That is absolutely the case because you can never get anything 100% right. If the centre is willing to work together to do the reforms that are necessary to have a better system, what we will have is not just a firm, fair and effective system for dealing with international protection, but, through the people who have come in here and are living and contributing in our country, we will have a better Ireland. With that, I thank all of the Deputies for their contributions."

                "For years, Sinn Féin has stood with the men and women who have built our economy from the ground up. We have championed the right to retire at 65, a milestone earned through decades of hard work and dedication. Yet we also recognise a simple truth: life does not always fit a single blueprint. Some people want to keep contributing, learning and shaping our world, even after 65, and they should have that option without being pushed out of their jobs or onto a less secure footing. The decision to retire is deeply personal. It is not one size fits all. Each person's health, job, finances and hopes for the years ahead come into play. Health can be a friend or a foe in this journey. It can open doors to more flexible work or make a longer career challenging. I heard a story from a worker who wanted to stay beyond retirement age but found signing a new contract meant different terms and conditions which left him worse off after a lifetime of service. We must ensure no one is forced to accept worse conditions simply because of their age. The right to continue working must be safeguarded, not traded away in the fine print of a new agreement.",
                "The heart of our position is simple: every person should be able to decide how to shape their own life after years of hard work. Sinn Féin supports, firmly and clearly, the right to retire at 65 with a full pension and the equally important right to keep working, if that is what a person desires. Too long and too often, workers have had mandatory retirement ages written into their contracts. If you want to stay on and contribute your knowledge and skills, you should not be forced out because of age or face a change in terms and conditions that undermines your well-earned security.",
                "I welcome this Bill because it aligns with our long-standing goal of removing mandatory retirement clauses and restoring real choice to workers. The freedom to decide to retire or continue working must belong to the individual, not to a corporate policy or outdated rules that deny people agency over their own lives. After a lifetime of work, people deserve the chance to retire with their pension at 65 or to carry on contributing. Right now, too many are pushed out of jobs and into unemployment long before reaching pension eligibility. With that income gap comes stress, uncertainty and a squeeze on families already facing the pressures of the rising cost of living. When workers are pushed out, it is not just a pay cheque that vanishes. The social connections, daily routine and sense of purpose that come from being part of a team can also disappear. We must protect those bonds and support mental health by ensuring fair terms and keeping doors open to continued employment, if that is what a person wants.",
                "We stand with workers and we want to work on their terms with employers who want to retain the experience and energy of their seasoned staff, and with a government that will not duck this issue. It is time to commit to a policy that respects choice, protects earned benefits and recognises the value of a life spent contributing to the working environment. We will not abandon the principle that workers should have control over their own careers. We will continue to advocate for a system where a worker at 65 can choose to retire with their pension or continue working with terms that respect their experience and contributions.",
                "We ask the Minister of State to ensure any Bill before us preserves the rights of workers to work on their own terms and guarantee that those who wish to keep contributing do so on fair and secure conditions, while those who retire can do so with dignity and full pension rights. We welcome the Bill but urge the Minister of State to listen to his constituents and the public, who want the choice of retiring at 65 with dignity and security or staying in the workforce, if that is their decision."

                "Due to decades of underinvestment, our energy system is not fit for purpose. With rip-off costs and a regressive approach to financing, our electricity grid is another in a long line of Government failures. It has been plagued by critical infrastructure deficits. Millions of euro have been wasted in renewable energy every year, driving up the cost of energy. One of the current members of Government described the Government's approach in recent years as navel-gazing and sitting on their hands. It has also stopped people moving into their homes. The need for urgent action and investment in the grid is clear.",
                "This amendment relates to a series of Acts going back to 1954. It concerns the framework that will guide the borrowing capacity of the ESB into the future.",
                "It is, of course, the State-owned agency but it should be mandated with a focus on the common good. It will seek to safeguard against future investment in and development on the grid that may repeat the mistakes of the past, which we do not want to do. The grid needs upgrading at present and while Sinn Féin is totally in favour of increased investment in the grid, it must be done in a way that covers and supports ordinary workers and families and works for the common good of people in the State. A grid that is fit for purpose is a linchpin of many of our priorities. Of course, we want to solve the housing crisis, end the energy rip-off, bring down prices for good and create an energy market that is based on a fair funding model in which energy is treated as a public good, as I have said.",
                "Amendment No. 1 proposes three subsections. Subsection (4A) mandates that the increased borrowing capacity of the ESB from €12 billion to €17 billion is targeted towards the public good rather than being gobbled up by data centres. The increased borrowing capacity will allow the ESB to access the capital required to fulfil the investment required in the network as outlined in the draft decision in price review 6, PR6, a final determination on which is due towards the end of this year. Grid capacity in recent years has been gobbled up by data centres and other key strategic priorities such as housing are suffering as a result. As ESB Networks itself warned against this in a recent appearance at the committee, Sinn Féin wants to ensure that the enhanced investment is targeted towards the social good rather than corporate interests. The prioritisation framework is modelled on the Dutch authority for consumers and markets, ACM, model, which refers to congestion softeners, security encompassing Garda stations, hospitals and wastewater treatment, basic needs, including residential construction, and exceptional cases of public interest. It excludes connections for data centres. They are not a priority in contrast to the priority for the need for housing.",
                "Our amendment inserts the new subsections to include the congestion softeners in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d), and proposes that within six months of the commencement of this Act a report would be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas detailing the amount borrowed under section 4(4) of the Act of 2001, the purposes for it, the projected borrowing required for next year including a breakdown of project type and the impact on consumer electricity prices. That is vitally important in a time where we have seen the supports ripped away. Even though prices on the wholesale energy markets have been reduced by 70% over the last three years, electricity bills have increased by around the same amount. We must also ensure that borrowing under this Act does not result, as I said, in domestic electricity tariffs beyond inflationary adjustments. There should be published an annual statement confirming compliance, and that would be laid before the Houses.",

We have to make sure that the grid is fixed. It has been weakened by decades of lack of investment and we have to make sure that we are prioritising the grid to make sure that we can deliver the homes we so need. I was talking in the infrastructure committee today where we had the construction workers in. I was saying that when you go away on your holidays, no matter how lovely the hotel was, when you come home and you get into your own bed with your own pillow, there is nothing like it, and we have now passed the point of 5,000 children homeless. The Government is shameless. We have to make sure that by investing in the grid, we are making sure that it is for houses and not data centres.

We are about to embark on the largest and most significant investment in the grid infrastructure, pretty much in the history of the State and certainly since rural electrification. This Bill is an important part of that because it allows an increase in borrowing and it allows for the first time an equity injection in ESB, which will reduce the overall borrowing cost for it.",

                "This legislation will help to underpin price review 6, which is our investment in the electricity grid and in the network over the course of the remainder of this decade. I thank the Deputies for the suggested additions but I am not in a position to accept either of those amendments. In relation to pre-legislative scrutiny, I wrote to the committee seeking a waiver. That was granted by the committee. I thank the committee for doing that. I think it was recognised that this is urgent and important legislation.",

I genuinely recognise the positive intent of what is proposed to ensure the network development priorities will prioritise the connection and supply of hospitals, Garda stations and houses. PR6, when the Deputies see it published, will identify exactly what this grid investment is underpinning. That is underpinning the houses that we need. It is underpinning the social infrastructure, the schools, the industrial infrastructure that we need and the future growth. To present the argument that the amendments here are about us trying to stop Government investing in a grid purely to allow further growth in data centres is not correct. On PR6, the Deputies have seen the draft decision and the final decision should be out shortly. The Deputies will see how that is clearly itemised.",
                "We are considering how this matter can be reviewed but as it currently stands under EU law, connection and supply must be carried out in a non-discriminatory manner. That is prescribed in EU law. However, we are currently considering how this can be reviewed and I will be happy to share that information once that review has been concluded.",

                "The vast majority of these will serve the multiple needs I mentioned - security of supply, gird resilience and grid expansion - enabling us to bring additional renewable energy generation and distribution into our grid. Ireland is a European leader in the integration of renewables into our grid. While there are still challenges, it is important we recognise that things have been done well, although we need to do better. We need to meet the critical demand for increased power supply that is there for both residential and business customers.",
                "The new subsection (b) will place specific reporting requirements on the ESB regarding its borrowing. Its borrowing is already outlined and published in its annual report and accounts, which are audited. In light of the significant investment by the State, and as part of the ongoing engagement with the ESB, we will develop a share subscription agreement that will require ESB Networks to provide significant detail on how it is financing, and the financing of its programme of investment, including its debt raising. As part of this agreement, ESB Networks will be required to deliver a quarterly report to me in relation to its ongoing expenditure, its project management and project delivery of the core infrastructural projects of PR 6. First, it is the investment in the quantum of money we need to invest and then it is about making sure it is delivered upon because this is absolutely critical. That will be reported to me directly as Minister. It will of course be open to ESB Networks, EirGrid and others to come in front of the Oireachtas committee, and rightly so.",
                "In addition to the oversight by my Department, the CRU, under the PR 6 guidelines, will also require a significant increase in reporting by ESB Networks on its expenditure and programme delivery. The combined efforts of the CRU and my officials will result in very significant and appropriate oversight of this Government investment on behalf of our people. It will ensure value for money and, most importantly, expedient delivery of the critical grid infrastructure we need to support families, our citizens and businesses in the State.",
                "On the impact of the ESB's borrowing on consumer energy prices, the amount charged to customers by electricity suppliers, including network charges, are a matter for the supplying company. We have oral questions tomorrow morning on this, but I will say that we have already published the national energy affordability task force interim report. We have taken some measures already in the budget. There are further longer term measures we will be working on towards publication of the final report in 2026. We will look at things such as network charges and length of borrowing repayments to reduce that charge on customers. To be helpful, and this is just a guide, the average annual increase for a typical domestic customer's network tariff will be around €6 over the five years to 2030. This does not mean the overall energy bills will rise by the equivalent amount because some of the investments will drive lower overall system costs.",
                "One significant investment that will drive down overall electricity costs is the North-South interconnector, which needs to be delivered. It will be a major project to deliver grid resilience and expansion and will drive down costs for households. I hope and expect we will get support to commence and complete that consented project, which is critical to the all-Ireland electricity network and to our citizens on this island North and South.",
                "The proposed new section 4(c) would prevent any borrowing activity by the ESB that could lead to domestic increases in electricity tariff rates beyond inflation and require the ESB to publish an annual statement confirming compliance. Under its legal mandate, it is the CRU, as the independent regulator, which is responsible for the network tariffs and grid investment plans. Network charges are a primary manner in which grid infrastructure is funded. What we have done, not just through the equity investment in the ESB but the further equity investment we will make in EirGrid, is reduce the amount of borrowing required to allow both organisations to leverage off the capital investment. The CRU sets out the network tariff to align with the grid investment plans. As such, it would not be appropriate to legislate to restrict activities related to the network.",
                "Amendment No. 2 relates to section 3. The Deputies outlined its content. I thank them for the suggested addition, but I propose to reject this amendment also. The proposed new section 7(d) would require an independent audit of the employee share ownership plan, ESOP, as the approved scheme and for the findings to be published within three months.",
                "The proposed new subsection (8) specifies that nothing in the Bill should be construed to allow the sale or transfer of capital stock to anyone other than the relevant Ministers and the employees of the ESB, or the trustees on their behalf. It is already the case that stock in the ESB can only be owned by the Ministers, employees and their trustees through the ESOP. Employees can only sell their stock shares to other employees, the ESOP trustee or to the ESB in a closed market. Any shares purchased by the ESB are cancelled.",
                "The proposed new subsection (9) would involve the creation of a prioritisation framework that would require the investment provided by Government through capital stock subscriptions to be used only for projects that contribute to specific use or specified uses, while excluding upgrades or connections for data centres.",

                "I thank the Deputies for their support for this legislation. It is critical and important. Everyone in this House recognises the urgent need for increased investment in our grid to ensure that we can continue to expand renewables and drive costs down for domestic and business customers. We are on the cusp of a significant level of investment and output through renewable energy when, last year, over 41% of our electricity was generated through renewable sources. We intend, through these and other measures, including successful auctions we have had in relation to onshore renewables as recently as a number of weeks ago, to further expand the renewables base we have and work towards reaching our target of 80% renewables by 2030. I thank the Deputies for their amendments but I am not in a position to accept them."

We do not fully know what will be there but under the CRU's draft decision, households and SMEs will see their electricity network charges increase, while large energy users, such as data centres, will see reductions of up to 18%. It also stated that the grid upgrades are being driven in part by growing electricity demands from the same data centres, whose usage has increased by 400% since 2015. In effect, the entities that are driving the increased need for grid investment will be asked to contribute less while the public pays more.",

                "Our amendment deals with a prioritisation framework, which has been done in other countries, notably, the Netherlands. It will include security, which includes hospitals, Garda stations, water safety and wastewater treatment because it is important the structures are put in place. There has been a lot of talk recently about wastewater treatment systems around the State, or the lack of them. It is also about housing, where people who have made agreements to go into their homes have not been able to do so because the connections have not been there. It also prioritises the basic needs of residential construction and exceptional cases of public interest, as I mentioned, which also relate to the previous amendment.",
                "The amendment also states:",
                "(10) The Board shall, within 6 months of the commencement of this Act and annually thereafter, lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas a report detailing:",
                "(a) the purposes for which the payment was applied [so necessary oversight] including a breakdown of project type;",
                "(b) the purposes for which the pay will be applied in the next year including a breakdown of project type;",
                "(c) the impact [if any] on consumer electricity prices;",
                "the report shall be subject to review by the Oireachtas Committee on Climate, Energy and the Environment and the Oireachtas Committee of Public Accounts.",
                "(11) The Board will ensure that any borrowing under this Act does not result in an increase in domestic electricity tariffs beyond inflationary adjustments, and shall publish an annual statement confirming compliance to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.”.”.",
                "While we agree with the need for more borrowing and we agree that there should be more investment in the grid, this should be done with some safeguards in place because we do not believe that they have been in place. The priorities are not there and there should be a prioritisation framework. Amendment No. 2 addresses this issue in the Bill. I accept that the committee agreed to waive pre-legislative scrutiny even though there was opposition to that. It is now ten months since Storm Éowyn took place and it was a bit rich of the Government to come in to say that it needed to do it all in a hurry when the Bill was not published until the middle of the summer. We are now being pushed into a corner with the suggestion that there is a panic that we have to do it all in a hurry. We should be getting it right before we agree to all of the legislation without what we feel are necessary amendments.",
                "Due to the constraints on the grid, there has been a history of failing to plan properly and treating affordability as an afterthought. Since June, there have been a series of energy bill hikes from various companies. One even increased its bills on two occasions. The corporate balance sheet certainly seems to have been the priority. Checks and balances need to be put in place particularly through the provisions of amendment No. 2 where we feel that public investment should be delivering for the public good. I know that the €1.5 billion was announced in the revised NDP in July. When it was announced, the Government said that it would be targeted at expanding onshore and offshore capacity and the distribution network infrastructure. Our amendments, particularly amendment No. 2, seek to ensure that this is the case and that past mistakes are not repeated."

We have to make sure that the increased investment in the grid goes towards the public good.",
                "More importantly, amendment No. 2 deals with €1.5 billion in public funds drawn from the Central Fund rather than borrowed. The fact that this money is not voted by the Oireachtas means that there will be limited scrutiny of it. I believe the Sinn Féin amendment helps to close that gap to ensure that there will be transparency and accountability in how that money is spent, and to ensure that the investment goes towards renewable capacity, network upgrades and the public good. I believe no funds should be used for new data centres. We just do not have the energy there and the data centres are insatiable. The more we produce, the more they look for. Meanwhile, we need to start building houses.",

As we know, there are only really two measures relating to the income tax package that is in this Bill. One is a small measure, which relates to the universal social charge and which reflects the increase in the minimum wage. The other measure is a huge tax provision relating to the special assignee relief programme, SARP. Those who earn above €125,000 can receive over €100,000 of a tax reduction. Those are the only two income tax proposals in this legislation.",

However, the Minister has always made the case that the income tax bands needed to be adjusted to reflect rising wage pressures. I want to put it to him at the start of consideration of this Finance Bill, when we deal with this issue, that this is a Bill which leaves workers worse off than they were last year and that has been reflected right across the State in terms of their anger at what the Government has brought forward with the €9.4 billion package that actually leaves workers worse off.",

I accept that, in the absence of indexation of tax bands and credits, it does have an effect on workers within our economy and society. At the same time, we will continue to see wage growth take place in our economy, meaning that across next year with wages going up, once workers have paid their taxes, I expect to see a net increase in after-tax income.",
                "Overall, in the construction of the budget, we have to ensure the budget is of a certain size. The reason for that is my view that if the budget was any larger than €9.4 billion - it is already a very big budget - and I were to add on top of that a personal package of indexation with regard to bands and credits, it would have taken the overall size of the budget up to anywhere between €10.5 billion and nearly €11 billion. My assessment is that a budget of that scale could pose real challenges to our ability to afford some of the changes we have made.",

The Deputy is correct; there are some areas within that on which we have disagreed over a number of years. I look forward to continuing that debate in this Finance Bill. The way I am trying to support workers and growth in their income is by investing in jobs and in their future. My concern is that if I had added on top of that a personal taxation package of €1 billion to €1.5 billion, it would have posed real, long-term risks to our ability to afford the changes in this budget.",

For transparency, the following are not my words, but the words of the Minister's party leader, Simon Harris, when he said with regard to not adjusting income tax: \"That's the equivalent, we just need to be honest, of saying there will be tax rises\". The Minister disagrees with that statement. He obviously thought it was my statement. It is actually that of his party leader. It is the Tánaiste's statement. Is that not a fact? I understand the Minister is not going to be in a position to say that today because the Tánaiste said it at a time when he promised the public there would be tax reductions but that was before the election. After the election, the Minister has come forward with a Finance Bill - it is not a case of him having to increase the budget package, as he could have made other choices in relation to taxation, but we will come to them later on - where he has allowed developers and landlords to pay very little and, in some cases, no taxes. He has allowed very wealthy people - we will see the statistics on people who earn over €3 million - to get a tax reduction of over €100,000 in this Finance Bill. These are all choices the Minister has decided to make. I wanted to make that very clear. What the Minister is talking about here is not a contrary position to mine. It is a contrary position to that of his party leader, the Tánaiste, Simon Harris, before the election. I wanted to clarify that."

My view and that of the Government is that if we had brought forward a budget that increased capital spending by the scale in which it has, had a current spending increase in excess of 6% and brought forward a personal tax package of €2.5 billion at a time in which we can see all of the change that is taking place around the world, that would have been the wrong thing to do.

People will understand that if tax credits and bands are increased over a couple of years, we cannot suddenly think that there has to be X amount happening every year. People's finances and the economy of this country are more long-term things. One makes choices, as the Minister has done, at a particular point in time that are the most sensible choice for the economy. That is the responsibility. It is not always the most popular thing but sometimes it is the right thing.",

For the purpose of transparency and simplicity, the USC is effectively income tax. People think our top rate of tax is 40%; it is not. You pay 8% USC over 70-something thousand euro. Over time, to make our income tax system more transparent, the USC should be incorporated into our income tax system and we should get rid of the term \"USC\" altogether."

We pointed out during that campaign that you could not have a whole range of expenditure increases while reducing our tax take and that that was an irresponsible approach to take. We now see that yesterday the Minister published a report about future constraints we will be under relating to the lower number of workers versus the number of people who are retired, the ratios there and the risk of increased budget deficits. We already have an underlying budget deficit. There is a real issue with promises being made during election campaigns not just on 40,000 homes or reduced childcare or student fees but also about tax cuts that the Government then does not deliver on.

First, at least the proposals my party brought forward during the election campaign were based on the premise of indexation and the need to do that. Again and again in the election campaign I made clear that I would never do anything that would cause what I believe would be a risk to our public finances. That has always been my starting point in many different election campaigns and all the different budgets I have done. The first priority has to be that you have to make choices, and the key choice is not to bring forward a budget that could be of such a scale that it might influence in a bad way choices that have to be made in the budgets that follow. I emphasise again that a budget that, overall, had increased investment at the scale that this budget has, that still involved an increase in current spending and that had brought forward an overall tax package of, let us say, €2.5 billion to €2.7 billion or €2.8 billion, I believe, would have been the wrong thing to do. I accept and understand that this is a tough argument to make with everything that is going on in people's live at the moment, but I think it would be a cause of greater cynicism in the long run if we were to bring forward budgets that we knowingly believe could create risks and for those risks to happen."

I am surprised the Minister has stood over a package from just a year ago that he has literally thrown out the window. I have looked at his commitments. It was interesting and very helpful that Deputy Timmins mentioned merging the USC with PRSI. That was not just something the Minister examined. It was another commitment that was given by Fine Gael in the election. It was in its manifesto. It followed from a commitment in a previous election campaign where Fine Gael promised to abolish the USC as well. There is a trend here. The abolition of the USC, a commitment in an election, was gone and was dumped after the election. Merging USC with PRSI, a commitment in the Fine Gael manifesto, was dumped after the election. The commitment it made in the last election was that it would increase bands by €2,000 per year every year and not, as Deputy Timmins says, within five years. Fine Gael was explicit. It was every year. That is nowhere to be seen either. This is by choice. The Minister has made choices and he will defend those choices and defend hundreds of millions of euro going to developers. I cannot see that anywhere in Fine Gael's manifesto, and that is the sneakiness for which the public have low regard. It is that broken promise and it breaks down trust in relation to political representatives. I know the Minister is hanging on to the idea that he did not want to do a package beyond that, but there were options within that, and this is one of the options we are putting forward. We have other amendments, and there are amendments from others here, as to how additional revenue could be raised to pay for the likes of a personal taxation proposal, or others may have other proposals in terms of increased expenditure. It is not the case, however, that if you do something it just increases the package. It can be offset by other measures or deciding not to go ahead with a tax cut, for example, for developers or for landlords or maybe looking at higher taxes in relation to banks, which are making super profits.",
                "This proposal is about the abolition of the USC on the first €40,000 that individuals earn. It is something Fine Gael once campaigned on. The Minister stood for photo shoots with a policy that went way beyond this. It was to abolish it not just on the first €40,000 but for everybody. This would benefit people in the here and now as we are dealing with the cost-of-living crisis. It would benefit people to the tune of nearly €750. In my view, it is a part of a package of supports that is required, particularly now, given the cost-of-living crisis we have."

                "I thank the Deputy for bringing this forward. Before I deal with the amendment itself, I want to put on the record of the committee the changes that have been made with regard to personal taxation over recent years. Looking at where we were in budget 2021, the entry point to the higher rate of income tax was €35,300. In budget 2025, it now stands at €44,000 for a single person, so the entry point into the higher rate of income tax has increased by €8,700. It has gone up by a quarter during that period. The entry point for a married couple with two earners has gone up from €70,600 in 2021 to €88,000 in budget 2025, an increase of 24.6%. During that period, the 4.5% rate of USC, which is the main rate of USC that most people in our economy pay most of their USC on, has gone from 4.5% to 3%. In the debate on what we could do in the future, I just wanted to refer to what we have done in the recent past and the changes that have happened.",
                "In relation to the amendment Deputies Doherty and Farrell have brought forward, they are seeking a report on removing the USC from the first €40,000 a person earns. The USC was designed and incorporated into the Irish taxation system in 2011 to replace two other charges, namely, the health and income levies. The primary purpose of the USC was to widen the tax base and to provide a steady income to the Exchequer to provide funding for public services. The USC is a more sustainable charge than those it replaced and is applied at a low rate on a wide base. It is important to acknowledge the significant contribution the USC has made in meeting the many spending demands placed on the Exchequer. The yield of the USC was €5.7 billion in 2024, with a yield of €5.6 billion forecast for 2025. If it were to be significantly altered, it would be necessary to consider how this yield could be generated from alternative sources.",
                "With regard to the Deputies' proposal, I am advised that the estimated cost would be €1.44 billion in the first year and €1.65 billion in a full year. Not only would this measure be very costly, it would have the effect of hollowing out the USC base by removing approximately 1.17 million taxpayer units from this charge. As it stands, it is estimated that 29% of all taxpayer units will not be liable for the USC in 2026. This proposal would significantly narrow our tax base as it would mean that 63% of taxpayer units would not be liable to pay the USC. In my opinion, this would be a policy choice that could create a real vulnerability for funding our public services and weaken the original policy intention of the USC to widen our tax base and provide a stable and sustainable source of revenue for the State.",
                "We have a very progressive income tax code in Ireland, which plays a crucial role in the process of income redistribution. Our redistributive tax system has been acknowledged by the IMF, the OECD and the ESRI. Deputies will be aware that during the economic crisis, it reached a point that 45% of all income earners were exempt from income tax, which was unsustainable and placed an unfair burden on those earners who were contributing to the income tax base, and only created the vulnerability that was ultimately exposed by shock. It is my view that a broad-based, progressive income tax system, where the majority of income earners make some contribution according to their means, is the fairest and most sustainable income tax system in the long run. Having regard to all this, as well as the very large erosion of the tax base which this measure would cause, I believe there is no need to carry out a further analysis of the proposals outlined by the Deputies given the debate we have had up to this point and for that reason I cannot accept this amendment."

                "“Report on Rent Tax Credit",
                "4.The Minister shall, within one month of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before Dáil Éireann a report on the Rent Tax Credit operating in the absence of a cap on rents, making a direct comparison between the amount of the credit and rent increases across the State for each year that the credit has been in operation.”.",
                "Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 are in my name. While I wish to speak on the amendments that have been brought in by colleagues regarding indexation and refundable tax credits, for the purposes of this section, I am just going to deal with rent tax credits. I will come in later and discuss the other ones. I know they are grouped but there are no time limits on the committee and therefore, we can decide which way we want to deal with them and that is the way I am going to deal with them. On the renter's tax credit, as the Minister will recognise, there is a bit of a trend here. This is another area where he has broken his promise to the public. He promised the public that he would increase the renter's tax credit. He said he would increase it to €1,500 but it is still at €1,000. He made it clear that it would be €100 extra per year, so it was not the case that it might happen some time in the future; it was an explicit commitment that this would be happening every year. The Minister has chosen to provide tax reductions for others instead. Fianna Fáil actually went further in its manifesto; it wanted to see the number increase to €2,000.",
                "I made the case many years ago that we needed to see the renter's tax credit. In fairness to the Minister and the rare occasions that we do agree on some things, he made the point that the reports, including that of the Commission on Taxation, which looked at the previous iteration of the renter's tax credit introduced in the 1980s, called for its abolition and for it to be phased out, which happened a number of years ago. The Minister made the point that it had the impact of pushing up rents. He rightly made the point that a renter's tax credit would have the same impact and that in reality, it would be a transfer to landlords. I agree with that point. That is why we have never argued solely for a renter's tax credit on its own. On its own, it will do exactly as the Minister and the Commission on Taxation have said, that is, pushing up the price of rent. Unfortunately that is what we have been seeing before the renter's tax credit and since it has been introduced. The Government always needed to introduce this measure with a ban on rent increases, thereby ensuring that a renter's tax increase went into the pockets of the tenants and not those of the landlords. That is what is happening here.",
                "I have two issues in respect of these amendments. The first is for the Minister to lay a report before the Dáil on the renter's tax credit operating in the absence of a cap on rents, making the direct comparison between the amount of the credit and the rent increase across the State each year that the credit has been in operation. We can see some of that from the ESRI and RTB figures, and some of it from the Daft rental index, which shows there has been a significant increase in rents since this measure was introduced. We are talking about people who are paying thousands of euro extra each year because of the runaway rents we are seeing. Amendment No. 3 also calls on the Government to bring forward a report on the changing real value of the renter's tax credit in respect of rent prices, and the decision not to increase the rent tax credit. Again, that brings into focus the Minister's broken promise. There will be a list of broken promises as we go through the Finance Bill but we are only on section 4 and we have already come to two main ones. There is a broken promise in terms of the commitment he gave workers to reduce their taxation. Now there is a broken promise to renters, which was not about extending the rent tax credit. I am sure the Minister will talk about that; it has happened. He went way further than that. He said he recognised the pressures that were on individuals and that he was going to increase the renter's tax credit. Renters will get no increase next year. They will get what they got. Landlords will get an increase next year. Well done. Priorities are very clear. Landlords get €1,000 of a rent increase. It is not in this Finance Bill but was stitched into a previous Finance Act. Renters do not get an increase on what they already got. The reality is that what the renters get is going to end up in the pockets of the landlords, because the Government refuses to bring in meaningful measures that would prevent rents increasing during this period of absolute crisis for renters."

                "That is fine. On the rent tax credits, first, Deputies Doherty and Farrell are requesting a report on the rent tax credit operating in the absence of a cap on rents, making a direct comparison between the amount of the credit and rent increases. They are therefore suggesting, as has just been done, that the rent tax credit should be complemented by rent caps. However, there are currently certain limits to rent increases. Rent increases in a rent pressure zone cannot exceed general inflation. While there is not a freeze in place, the rent pressure zones are in operation. The ESRI published research on this. Rent pressure zones now cover the entire country. The consumer price index identifies that the standardised average rent for new private tenancies increased by 5.9% in 2022, 9.2% in 2023 and 6.2% in 2024.",
                "More broadly, the Government is placing its main focus on delivering on the Housing for All strategy. The aim in doing so is that additional supply over time will help to moderate housing costs for those who want to rent and those who want to buy.",
                "Additional measures are being brought forward with regard to housing supply. This year, the Government has allocated €6.8 billion in capital expenditure for housing delivery. This represents a sixfold increase in just a decade. More than 4,500 cost-rental homes have been delivered since the launch of this tenure through various different channels including local authorities, AHBs, the LDA and the cost-rental tenant in situ scheme.",
                "In relation to increases in the credit, for the years 2022 and 2023, the rent tax credit was valued at a maximum of €500 per single individual and €1,000 per jointly assessed couple. For the years 2024 and 2025, it was doubled to €1,000 per single individual and €2,000 per jointly assessed couple. It has now been extended for a further three years, benefiting - and they need this benefit - 315,000 taxpayer units, equating to almost 400,000 individuals. The programme for Government contains a commitment to \"progressively increase the Rent Tax Credit\". However, due to the many different demands that were there in relation to the budget, while this is something I hope and believe will be done in future budgets, as I said, due to the size of the overall budget and the other issues on which I had to make progress, I did not bring it forward at this particular time.",

                "On the other proposals, first, on the measure that applies to landlords, we anticipate the overall cost for 2025 will be approximately €111 million. That is the best figure we have available to us. The rent tax credit in place at the moment involves an overall cost for this year of €350 million, so it is significantly higher in cost than the measure which has been brought forward with regard to landlords. The only reason measures are being brought forward in respect of landlords and - we will debate this later - to support developers is to increase supply and ensure that more apartments in particular will be built. The purpose is to try to keep landlords within the sector, because it remains the case that it will not be possible to make progress on the affordability and cost-of-living issues for tenants in particular in the absence of measures which stabilise and increase supply in the years ahead. That is the sole reason why measures are there with regard to landlords and supporting the private sector. I reiterate that if you look at the measure that is being funded and extended for renters, you can see that it is considerably in excess of the landlord-related measure."

The Minister also will not deny that if we look at the figures from the RTB for last year, we can see that the rent increase alone exceeds the amount of the tax credit. That is the reality. That is in relation to new tenancies, by the way. The amounts relating to existing tenancies are also going up significantly.",

Does the Minister not acknowledge, and this is what the amendment seeks to deal with, that the annual increase imposed on renters in the past couple of years was massive? It amounts to thousands of euro. When we talk, therefore, about providing a tax credit of €1,000 to an individual when rents continue to increase, there is a hole in the bucket. That is the problem. This money is ending up in the pockets of landlords. That is why the Minister made the point that this is what would happen. That is why the Commission on Taxation made the point that it would happen. That is why the evidence was that in the absence of a cap, we will see increases in rents - this is because it is baked in - and that is exactly what is happening.",

Without a cap, this measure will actually fuel that. Worse still, it suggests that the Minister is doing something for tenants when he is not. That is because this will end up being baked into rent costs and will increase costs for everybody. It needs to be done, and I argued for this rent credit for years. I made the argument for it year after year, but the Minister stood steadfast against it because he was only taking one part of it. However, a two-pronged approach was always required. The Minister was right to stand against it if we were only doing it without a cap. With a cap, it could be effective in terms of the prices tenants are being charged and, crucially, it would make sure money went into tenants’ pocket at a time of very high rents. Even if a cap had been introduced three years ago, rents were still far too high at that stage. That is without talking about the rents as they are today."

In both cases, where a tenancy changes over, rent increases year after year have broken what is allowable under law. A 2% increase has been allowable under law. Every year, in both instances, that has been broken significantly. When I raised this with the Taoiseach and others, they stated that if we regulate too hard, we will drive landlords out. It is as if the laws in this area are somehow optional. Laws are not optional. However, proper measures have not been put in place to enforce these laws. In the absence of such measures, what we are seeing is that at least a portion of renters' tax credits are simply driving up rents. That has to be tackled in order that we get value out of the tax expenditure here."

                "I thank the Deputies for their contributions. First, I will deal with the relationship between the credits that are available for landlords and for renters. The landlord-related measure stood at €600 in 2024. At the same time, the rent tax credit stood at €1,000. The rent tax credit was not changed in this year’s budget, but in previous budgets it was doubled. In previous budgets, it has gone up by amounts of €200. In the budget before last, the rent tax credit was changed by an amount of €500. The landlord-related measure is going up in a preprogrammed way by €200. Where we are now at a point that both the rent tax credit and the landlord credit for 2026 will both stand at €1,000. As I said, the value and cost of the measure in relation to renters, at €350 million, is three times the amount of the measure that is in place regarding landlords. The reason the measure relating to landlords was brought forward by my predecessor was in an attempt, which I support, to try to retain smaller landlords within our rental sector and to stabilise and maintain the number of landlords who are providing the rental accommodation that is needed.",

When I started off doing debates in this room a number of years ago it was €3.7 billion, so it has gone up nearly fivefold during that period. If we were to meet all the different issues and needs that are there at the moment we would have brought forward a budget that would have been so big it would have created issues we would then need to respond to in the years ahead. I have seen what that can do to an economy and what it can do to the faith people have in the ability of politicians and of Government to make progress on issues that matter to them.",

I am aware of other cities that have rent caps in place. I see debates continuing to rage in many of those cities regarding the affordability of rent and the availability of rental accommodation. I emphasise again that while I understand the real benefit a rent increase cap would bring to those who currently have rental accommodation, the huge risk is that over time it could mean even less rental accommodation is available, not to mention we do not encourage new landlords to come into the sector to provide additional rental accommodation. That is why we have the rent pressure zone in place, which is not a cap but aims to moderate the increase in rents that is possible within properties covered by the rent pressure zone."

                "Amendment No. 4 concerns refundable tax credits. According to the CSO 6% of those in employment are experiencing poverty. A refundable tax credit would allow low income workers who do not earn enough to use their full credits to have the unused portion refunded. This would essentially be a cash payment to those who are already dealing with low pay to ensure they do not miss out on the benefits of tax credits. This would help a lot of people who are on very low incomes who are working and struggling, especially given the withdrawal of the energy credits and the failure to replace them with enough targeted measures. That section of people who are working but who are on very low incomes and are finding it hard to get by would be helped by a measure like this. Social Justice Ireland has long put forward the case for it. It is equitable and based around the philosophy that work should pay, which I am sure the Minister agrees with. I am sure it was not the intention but the evidence shows in previous budgets – there is a strong case, of course, for doing indexation – that low paid workers have missed out compared with high paid workers. A measure like this is targeted and aimed at those who need additional support and should be getting it. It would be better if we could get low paid workers into better paid employment and get their wages up, but that is going to take time. While that is happening a measure like this would really help and support them. It needs to be looked at and I ask that the Minister do that."

                "Before I respond to the substance of the Deputy's amendment I acknowledge the important point he has made, which is on my mind and needs discussion, regarding if and when we go back to personal tax changes based on indexation. The reality I have grappled with is that even when you do that it means there are workers in our economy who will not see much of a change in their after-tax income. That is a really important point we have to consider. The Deputy will be aware, and indeed he said there, that this is a consequence of the fact we have a progressive tax code in the first place. That means the lower income you have, the lower tax amount you pay. The Deputy may not have said it but I will say he was acknowledging it in his contribution. If we move back to indexation it means those who do not pay much income tax and USC in the first place will not see a big change in their after-tax income and then if you were to try to adjust that it would lead to a narrowing of the number of people who pay income tax or USC in the first place, which is something we should try to avoid doing over time. That simply means discussions that are had in other committees and on budget day regarding the role of targeted spending measures will continue to be really important in supporting those who are on low incomes within our society and who are paying a relatively low level of USC or income tax, even though in their eyes it is still a large share of the income they earn.",
                "On the measure the Deputy has brought forward to try to address that, the issue of refundable tax credits was recently examined as part of the tax strategy group, TSG, process in advance of budget 2024 and the analysis and findings of the review were published in the income tax TSG paper, which is available on the Department of Finance’s website. The review explored the concept of refundable tax credits, provided an overview of previous relevant studies and an overview of refundable tax credits in other countries and provided an economic analysis of refundable tax credits. The review identified a number of issues concerning their operation. It noted they would represent a fundamental change to the personal tax system. On the one hand refundable tax credits would help tackle in-work poverty, as the Deputy said, and would increase a measure of equity.",
                "However, there are already a wide range of existing policies tackling poverty and direct supports are a simpler and more effective means of providing assistance to low income households. That is the point I made a moment ago. Additionally, the introduction of refundable tax credits could potentially prove to be very costly and provide relatively little benefit to the majority of individuals, including those working full time and earning at least the national minimum wage, because such workers generally utilise their tax credits in the first place. Take, for example, a single individual. The entry point to income tax will be €20,000 per annum in 2026. However, a single full-time worker earning the national minimum wage will have income of €28,700 in 2026. They will actually utilise all of their personal tax credits and therefore a tax credit that is refundable will not be of benefit to them. This is somebody who is on the minimum wage.",
                "In addition, such credits could have behavioural impacts on labour supply and could reduce the incentive to take on additional work, though I should say that is a judgment and my experience continues to be that the vast majority – nearly everybody I meet – wants to work and find some kind of work, whether that is part-time or full-time work. God knows we have ample evidence of that in the number of people at work in our economy. The overall estimate provided by Revenue at the time of the review suggested a cost in the region of €1 billion for making tax credits refundable. This would be a really big operational change to implement. We have just done a detailed review of this, which has been published. It is for that reason I do not believe a further analysis is needed at the moment and that is why I am not accepting the Deputy’s amendment. As I said a moment ago, we did a review of this quite recently.",
                "The overall policy issue I have with the measure that is being proposed by the Deputy is the number of people who are on low incomes within our society who are still in a position to avail of the tax credits that are available. Therefore, I am not sure making them refundable would deliver the benefit I understand the Deputy wants to deliver. I am strongly of the view that the only way we are going to make progress on the issue he is identifying is targeted measures that are spending in nature rather than taxation."

                "First, I welcome the Minister's acknowledgement that there is an issue here in terms of low-paid workers and poverty. Nobody should be in poverty but the idea that people are working hard, are on an income where they are in poverty and the way the taxation system is designed is part of the problem, should not be the case. We should not have 6% of working people in poverty. That needs to be tackled. I welcome the Minister's acknowledgement of that and the detailed response. Regarding the examples the Minister was giving, the key thing here is that for a lot of low-paid workers who are in poverty, many of them are on the minimum wage or just above and many are in part-time work. There could be very good reasons they are in part-time work in terms of other responsibilities they have or what work is available for them in practical terms. They should not be in poverty when they are working. The Minister is right. My experience is that people seek as much work as they can. For people in part-time work who are in poverty, it is not because there is an element of choice there. They could be caring for a sick relative or elderly parents. There are different factors there that limit their availability. It is not a choice to be in poverty and to be working. This does need to be tackled and this is the way to do it. However, if the Minister is not convinced on this measure, there is a responsibility for him to look at what way this will be tackled. It is not simply enough that it should be tackled through other supports and transfers because, ultimately, if you are working you should not be in poverty and the way the taxation system is designed should support that. Therefore, it needs to be addressed."

                "I support the amendment from Deputy O'Callaghan. It is something we have raised ourselves on many occasions. It is a fundamental shift in relation to how taxation would apply but it looks at the issue of fairness. I was going to raise an issue regarding section 5 of the Bill but it may be appropriate to mention it here when we are dealing with the issue of refundable tax credits and particularly the Minister's comments regarding direct expenditure being the most appropriate way to support certain individuals. The issue is that this is not the case at the minute. If we look at amendment No. 4, it looks at refundable tax credits and \"making personal tax credits refundable for low-income earners\". If we look outside of personal tax credits and look at what else is available through the taxation system, there is a wide range of ways that we have, over many years, used the taxation system to support individuals who are in challenging difficulties. We know that from, perhaps not the tax credits but looking at it from the flat-rate expenses, that we do it for employees who are going to work and have to buy PPE and whatever but we also do it for individuals such as, for example, disabled drivers. The issue I was going to raise in section 5 was in respect of kidneys, that is, kidney donors. I have a connected person who would not benefit from this issue but is in a similar situation. If we take as an example that you are working and are currently going through home dialysis, you can avail of a flat-rate expense in excess of €4,000 for electricity costs because you have a machine that is going for about eight hours every single day and it costs electricity. Therefore, the taxation system has recognised that there is a flat-rate expense there in excess of €4,000 to assist you in terms of those additional costs. There are additional telephone costs and laundry costs because there are a lot of issues there. At this point, if you are one of the unfortunate people, including children, who have kidney disease and are doing home dialysis, you can benefit. Home dialysis is of huge benefit to the health system and it is great that this technology exists and that there are hundreds now doing it. If you are working you will get a flat-rate expense in excess of €7,000, which means that the benefit to you is about €2,800 in after-tax income. If you are not working you get none of that - not a penny - and that is not fair. In some cases, there will be a situation where people were working but because they are going through dialysis and chronic kidney disease they are not in a position to work.",
                "I agree with what the Minister has said to a certain degree as regards direct expenditure being the best way to support these individuals but that is not the system we have. We have a system that has looked at the taxation code to be able to support different individuals at different times, and rightly so, but it leaves out so many others. There is an issue even for people who are currently working, just to take that situation of home dialysis as an example. The problem with that is people may not get that allowance until next year and their bills are increasing now. We all know the rip-off costs in electricity. There is a real issue here. Taking two people living side by side who are on home dialysis, one is supported by the State through taxation costs and because of their illness an additional need is recognised by the State. The other person, who may be working part-time but does not have a tax liability, is not able to benefit from that. That is not good or fair. That is our taxation code. Refundable tax credits would address that. This is not a credit; it is an allowance but the refundable nature of this would allow for that. We have to find a way of dealing with this. This is just one example of this but there are numerous other examples. These are individuals who would not be entitled to medical cards and so on. These are real pressures that are on the system at this point. The system needs a proper overview of how we are using the taxation code to assist individuals. That is fine in terms of assisting individuals. However, who does it leave behind? That is what is at the core of Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment. How can we ensure that those who are left behind are not left behind? It is not fair that just because a person is in employment that allows for a tax liability that one person on home dialysis is supported to the tune of nearly €3,000 by the State and another person is not. I do not think that was ever the intention. The intention behind bringing forward these types of flat-rate expenses is a good intention. It is about supporting people but people are being left behind in this regard. This a very real issue that exists now but there are many others. That is just one example I wanted to bring up because we are dealing with human donors in section 5. I may revisit that at that stage. However, there are other examples in the taxation code. I mentioned disabled drivers but there are other measures. Incapacitated tax credits are another example. Children are not supported if there is not a tax liability there. There are many examples where the taxation code does a really good thing to support individuals who have health conditions in particular, or disabilities, but so many people are not able to avail of that because they do not have a tax liability."

If you are a married couple on a gross income within our country of €30,000, the amount of income tax you will be paying on that is zero.",
                "Therefore, a married couple on €30,000 are not paying any income tax on their income overall. This just highlights the point I am making, which is that, because our income tax code is so progressive in the first place, the level of tax somebody on a relatively low level of income within our economy pays means the amount of gain they will get back by making a tax credit refundable would be a relatively low share of their overall income but with a very significant cost to the Exchequer overall. This is a feature of the fact that our tax code is progressive.",
                "To deal with the Deputy's point regarding how we could better make progress in supporting people like that, it would be through seeing wages grow within our economy overall. That is why I believe changes that have been made with regard to minimum wages within our economy in recent years have been justified because they play a role in dealing with this kind of issue. My own assessment continues to be that there would measures that help with, for example, the affordability of childcare, measures like the working family payment and measures to help with the cost of going to school. For a smaller amount of the taxpayers' money, we can have a bigger benefit for those who are on a lower income within our country than we can by the implementation of refundable tax credits. I agree with the Deputy's diagnosis of the issue. I just have a different view regarding the best way of responding to it.",
                "I take Deputy Doherty's point. It is also the case, as he will know, that we have other credits that are available within our tax code to help those who are in hardship, whether it is a widow, someone involved in dealing with a disability or so on. There are credits available there, which I guess builds on the point the Deputy is making.",
                "On the point he made in relation to the cost of dialysis, I do not have direct personal experience of it. He may well do, and while I know it is obviously not influencing in any way the policy point he is making, it probably just demonstrates to him the issue we have to deal with here. I remember meeting on their doorstep a number of years ago a constituent who was on dialysis. They talked to me about the costs involved and the fact they were able to get that dialysis at home. Deputy Doherty mentioned the impact it had on our hospitals. Therefore, I very much understand the general point the Deputy is making. I remember that, as I was speaking to this person, I could hear the dialysis machine in the background. It really brought home to me the personal impact for somebody who has to use health equipment like that for hours every day to have some kind of standard of living and deal with a really serious health condition. I will certainly take away the point the Deputy is making regarding the lack of support that might be available for somebody who is not working and, therefore, does not access the tax reliefs that are available with regard to health expenses. I thought there would be some kind of support in place, but I will take on board the general point the Deputy is making and examine it further. It goes back to the general point I am making, though, that for some of these very specific issues, I think - I am convinced, in fact - that they are better off dealt with through spending measures than through our tax code. Otherwise, it leads to questions about the use of taxpayers' money and about how, while the level of tax paid by those we want to give it to the most is, in their eyes, a large share of their income, it is actually a low effective rate of income tax. For many of them, making the tax credit refundable would not offer too much of a benefit."

There is something very unjust about that, especially for low paid workers. Everyone feels the brunt of cost-of-living pressures, but for low-paid workers, it is particularly difficult keeping food on the table, getting the kids out to school, keeping the heat on and everything else. We should not have a situation like that. I will, therefore, press the amendment when we come to it."

                "To my knowledge and looking at the HSE, there is no support. There is lots of training in terms of home dialysis and a lot of support, including online support, but there is no financial support for home dialysis. I recognise that this is a good thing that has been done. We can look at what is happening in terms of home dialysis and something that is probably reasonably new. The latest figures show that there are probably 360 people who are using home dialysis across the State. When we think about the population in the State and the number of people who are using home dialysis, it is actually great that there is a measure in our taxation code that supports them. However, some of them are not getting supported and that is the point I am making. I think the figures from the HSE identified that 16 children were included.",
                "As I mentioned and the Minister acknowledged, there is a benefit to our hospital system. The cost, if you want to put a cost on this, is huge. The HSE estimates that somebody who is doing home dialysis - it does not or will not work for everybody - on average saves 150 trips to the hospital. That is just massive when we think of 150 trips per person in terms of the inconvenience, the cost of having to go and all of those issues. Where we have a code that can support people through taxation, there needs to be an alternative that supports people through direct payments. That is why I am raising this. There is a way to do this where it could be refundable, whether that is through the taxation code or otherwise. If it is not, and if the Minister is setting his face against that for his own reasons, then there has to be a recognition of the fact that, in our tax code, we have already recognised a number of health-related and disability-related issues. There are schemes in relation to the purchase of disability aids, but it is a VAT refund, so everybody is going to get it. That is great; there is nobody left behind in relation to that. Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, CAPD, is another example. However, the numbers we are discussing are small. We need to look at how we support those individuals who have the same issues and the same costs but because they are either not in employment or are in employment without a tax liability, they cannot be supported. I am asking the Minister as a senior person in government to bring that back, consider it and look to see whether it can be done within our tax code or whether there should be a complementary measure within the Department to make sure this cohort is supported. There was a recognition at a point in time, probably by Deputy Donohoe as Minister for Finance, to bring forward a measure to support these individuals. That recognition has to be there for some of those who are left behind. In this example, we are talking about very small numbers, but we are also talking about big costs for people whose lives have been upended because of the situation in which they find themselves."

In relation to Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's point, I emphasise again that the core of this challenge we are discussing is if you earn, for example, €25,000, your effective tax rate is 5.4%. The actual effective tax rate for those who earn low incomes within our society - it is a big share of their own income, they notice it going out of their wage slip, which I understand - but their effective tax rate is very low. It limits the degree to which tax policy can play a role in redistribution for those on our lowest levels of income. Comparatively speaking, if you are earning €50,000, your effective income tax rate is 10%. Your income is doubled and your effective tax rate is doubled. That is a feature of progressivity. That is the nub of the issue that I want to emphasise again."

This relates to developing a system where the cost of indexation of personal tax rates, credits and so on would be reflected in the summer economic statement published every year so there is clarity about what the cost would involve. The Minister will be aware there are forms of automatic indexation for personal tax rates and social protection systems in existence for some time in countries like Sweden, Belgium, Canada, Iceland, the Netherlands, Switzerland and many others. I have been reading quite a lot of OECD information on this recently. They are policy decisions those countries decide to make in their own contexts. These are countries against which we like to compare ourselves in terms of how our economy is managed and how our society is evolving. I was not always persuaded of introducing indexation on personal tax rates and credits but the more I read about it, the clearer the case is, especially in the context in the past two to three years of rising wages and the risk of people on very modest incomes being pushed into higher tax brackets and the challenging cost-of-living situation households find themselves in at the moment. I would like to hear the Minster's views on the proposition and if it is something the Government is prepared to consider."

In recent years, we have aimed to do that through the TSG process that has provided the costs with regard to indexation. On foot of the Deputy's amendment, I will make sure this is done in on a regular basis through the TSG process so that everybody is aware of the costs of that measure. I do not believe we should do it through the summer economic statement because it sets out the parameters of the budget, whereas the Deputy is looking for information regarding choices in the budget. I will make sure that is available through the tax strategy group process. I differ not so much with the Deputy's amendment but a point he went on to make. We should take care in making this an automatic decision. It should be a conscious political decision on budget day and as part of the budgetary process regarding whether this is something that should be done or not. I know from engaging with other finance ministers in Europe that making this an automatic decision can in harder times cause difficulties and crowd out other choices a government might want to make when developing a national budget. I agree with the Deputy's point on information and believe we can do it in a different way and meet the Deputy's need, which is why I am not accepting the amendment. I believe this should always be a conscious policy decision that is part of the budgetary process."

That is the meat and drink of politics as it should be. This year, clearly choices were made to cut VAT, for example, on apartment development and hospitality. Frankly, given the constraints we are operating under, that choice was made at the expense of a degree of indexation for working people who will, in some cases at the very least, experience tax increases next year and may not experience net increases in their take-home pay. We can argue that back and forward. The point that has been argued already this morning so I do not want to belabour it. This is absolutely about choice. I am more persuaded than ever about the efficacy of doing this based, for example, on the Commission on Taxation and Welfare report of a couple of years ago, which clearly laid out the option available to us in raising revenue form alternative sources and not having as much of a focus on raising taxes on income. Income tax is a very significant and important tax head. We should pride ourselves on the fact that we have a progressive tax system in this country. That should remain the case. By addressing issues around indexation and introducing that as a feature of our system, that then forces us to make other choices. I do not think that is a bad thing, given that we are not good in this country, in international comparators at least, on raising revenue in terms of non-productive assets and wealth. They are the choices made. I accept that. These are political choices."

There are a number of benefits for having employee ownerships. We have a situation at the moment where there are good enterprise supports for people establishing businesses and enterprises. They often reach a certain scale where the founder or founders want to sell. That could be after 20 years or it could be more. What often happens then at that point is that a private equity firm may come in and buy the enterprise or business into which a huge amount of blood, sweat and tears has gone and into which a huge amount of State supports, which are often very effective, has gone.",

The kind of long-term work that has gone in is sometimes lost and a lot of the value from that is lost. Getting a company where the owners and founders want to get that into the ownership of the employees is much better for that business and enterprise in the long run but it has also got real benefits in productivity. All the evidence shows that companies, businesses and enterprises owned by the employees in them are much more productive. They are better at problem solving, creating efficiencies and driving innovation and growth. These are all things that we want to do and support in our economy. This is good proven model of doing this and is an absolute win-win. However, at the moment the taxation code is prohibitive against people selling into employee shares or ownership trusts. At the very least, the taxation system should be changed in order that it is a level playing field at least for this type of company, if not actually incentivised. I urge the Minister to look at this."

The term \"EOT\" does not appear in Chapter 2 of Part 17 of, or Schedule 12 to, the Taxes Consolidation Act.

Following these discussions, I have been informed that changes to several taxes have been raised with us by stakeholders and will need further consideration by my Department. These refer to the discretionary trust tax, DTT, capital gains tax, CGT, and to the close company surcharge. As part of any consideration of the amendments to the tax Acts in light of this recommendation, it is important to be more precise regarding what would be the potential benefits, and of course, what will be the costs of implementing changes to facilitate the establishment of employee ownership trusts, which is in line with my Department's guidelines for tax expenditure evaluation.",

                "I thank the Minister for his response and Deputy O'Callaghan for articulating his support for the proposal. It is an area that is ripe for more work. It might be an area that the Ministers, Deputies Donohoe and Burke, and their officials could potentially continue to explore. My colleague, Deputy George Lawlor, has done a considerable amount of work in this regard. I am aware that the IPSA has met officials from the Department and that was a positive engagement. I am convinced that the Department understands the area and the barriers as well. It is certainly an area that can be developed here. Our systems, whether it be our taxation system, legal system and so on, are directly comparable with the UK. They have managed to successfully reform the situation there since 2014. The last time I checked, it was probably about 1,600 or 1,700 firms that may otherwise have been sold to private equity firms and others but which went on to be majority owned by their employees since those reforms were introduced in 2014.",
                "As Deputy O'Callaghan said, there is a lot of evidence available that would suggest there are productivity gains to be had. As I said in my earlier contribution, there are very few, if any, Irish firms of a scale that are being bought or have a majority stake in them from their staff because of the barriers that exist at the moment. The barriers are one of the reasons. There are other reasons as well. Certainly, founders I speak to and engage with all the time in my constituency and elsewhere state that this is an area they would like to explore and that they would like their staff to be able to benefit in the success of a company. This is a kind of a modern reform of stakeholder capitalism, if we can describe it as such. It is an interesting area. It is something that we need to explore. It is evolving all the time. We are behind the curve here in Ireland. There are too many Irish firms where the only option for a founder is to sell to private equity and to people with deep pockets from outside of this jurisdiction and outside of the European Union. We have a focus and I know the Minister is aware of the risks here of our excess reliance on foreign direct investment. This is one way we can shift the dial a little."

                "The Minister will be familiar with this. It is a proposal I put forward a number of years ago which has found its way into the tax code. It was put forward as a result of very high interest rates being charged at a time when interest rates were probably increasing at the European Central Bank. We have now seen that reverse, with interest rate reductions in the last period. The interest rate has stayed stable over the last three ECB meetings but there has been a gradual decrease in the ECB rate, which has stood at 2% since June. The problem is that very high interest rates are still being charged by traditional banks and lending non-banks across the State. Nearly 30% of all mortgage holders with traditional banks are paying over 4% at this time and 30% are paying over 5% with the lending non-banks. A substantial number of people are actually paying above that if they are in the lending non-bank space.",
                "The average interest rate across the eurozone in September was 3.3%. All these percentage points are big money for the average mortgage. A quarter of a percent could amount to a couple of hundred euro per month, which is a couple of thousand euro per year that should be in the householder's pocket as opposed to the pockets of the banks. The traditional banks in the State have made huge profits, totalling €5 billion between them last year. When we have a eurozone average interest rate of 3.3% and over one in four people here paying over 4%, there is an issue. I have made the point that the Government needs to stand up to the banks a bit more. Banks used to be called in and were told what was expected of them. Obviously, we cannot dictate or direct the policy – the Minister has ensured the shareholding of the State has been sold on, with PTSB to be the next to be sold – but there is a really big issue here. Certain customers are being ripped off. There are no two ways of describing that. If these banks were not making bumper profits, we would say customers were not being ripped off and this was just the market and businesses have to be profitable. Of course, they have to be profitable but €5 billion profit combined is a lot of profit. When mortgages are being charged well above the European average, there is an issue.",
                "We also have the issue of what I call mortgage prisoners. These are people whose loans have been sold to vulture funds with the support of the Government parties at the time. These people have really been screwed over. There are about 70,000 mortgage prisoners, of whom about 10,000 are paying over 6.5% interest rate. That is extortionate in anybody’s books. When the ECB rate is 2% and average eurozone rates are 3.3%, a 6.5% interest rate for nearly 10,000 people as of June this year is pure and utter greed and extortion. It is licensed and allowed, which is ridiculous in my view.",
                "This measure is necessary in this section because the banks are not passing on the interest rate reductions as would be expected. We know they did not increase them blow for blow as they went up. We do not expect them to reduce them blow for blow as they come down, but we do expect reductions and something more in line with the eurozone average. We definitely cannot stand over a situation where 10,000 families are being charged over 6.5% in interest on their mortgages. This measure is necessary but it should not be necessary because the banks should be doing their job and we should be in a more normal lending-rate environment in this State. Unfortunately, we are not. I am also concerned the relief will be phased out. Of course, it should be phased out because the banks should be reducing interest rates, but to make sure it can be phased out, we need to be able to stand up to the banking sector and ensure the banks are not making these bumper profits at the expense of mortgage holders.",

It was to provide for a report on the banks passing on ECB rates in a timely manner to mortgage holders in the form of lower interest rates. I understand that has been ruled out of order, citing a Standing Order which is about relevance. How in God’s name could this not be relevant when we are talking about taxpayers’ money having to go to support mortgage holders as a result of banks not passing on ECB interest rates? I am deeply shocked and I want direction from the Chair. Did the Department or the Journal Office come up with this? This cannot happen. As a TD, I am elected and it is my responsibility and job to bring forward amendments to the Finance Bill.

This is not a reflection on anybody but I want to raise the fact that I have a responsibility and a right to bring forward proposals. If we are going to get into the situation where we are spending taxpayers’ money on a measure to support people as a result of mortgages but we cannot look for the detailed policy that underpins that, namely, the rates that are being charged and whether the banks are passing them on, then that is nonsense.

There is only one way for me to ensure that that report is published and that is to table an amendment. The advice of the Minister's Department has been not to allow me to table that amendment and that it is not relevant. Under God, it is relevant. It is completely relevant to the fact that we are spending millions of euro in taxpayers' money on an issue as a direct result of the banks charging high interest rates. Minister, if the banks were charging lower interest rates, then mortgage interest relief would not exist this year or next year. That is the reality of it. This is a policy decision.

Standing Order 194, which is used to rule this out of order, says, \"It shall be an instruction to all Committees to which Bills may be committed that they have power to make such amendments therein as they shall think fit, provided that such amendments be relevant to the provisions of the Bill and are not in conflict with the principle of the Bill as read a second time.\" It does have to be tax related, as the Minister stated. It has to be \"relevant\". The Minister has given a reason for this amendment not to be tabled. Under this Standing Order, it either has to be not relevant to the provisions of the Bill or in conflict with the principles of the Bill. The amendment is clearly not in conflict with the principles of the Bill. Therefore, there is only one other area, that being, the Minister is claiming it is not relevant to the provisions of the Bill. The provisions of the Bill, under section 4, provide millions of euro in taxpayers' money to support mortgageholders, which is something that I support, but the reason for that support is the high interest mortgage rates at this point in time. I seek a report on what the banks are charging at this point in time and if they are passing on the ECB interest rates. I will leave my point there. If this is a trend that is going to happen within the Department - giving advice of this nature - then it will be challenged robustly by me."

It is important that the Minister puts it on the record that there is no payment in relation to the donation of organs. That would be highly unethical and illegal in this State but there is obviously compensation that would be paid in terms of somebody who would be in employment and would be off sick and so forth after a kidney transplant. I ask the Minister to put on record his note on section 5, for transparency purposes."

This amendment updates the reference to the relevant legislation to ensure that the compensation paid to living donors shall continue to be exempt from income tax. In relation to the expense, given the matter the Deputy raised, donors would generally incur expenses associated with travel and accommodation as well as suffering loss of income during the process of providing a donation. The reimbursement may apply to vouched expenses of travel and accommodation up to a maximum of €8,000, loss of income relating to a donation of up to a maximum of €15,000, and childcare costs that would otherwise not have been incurred, up to a maximum of €6,750."

I do not oppose the proposals in either this section or in section 10 but there is a wider issue, given that two sections of the Finance Bill deal with tax incentives on donations for capital projects or to bodies. It is great that people are making donations to sporting organisations or for particular capital projects. This section deals with the fact that if it is a particular project, there has to be unique identifier code. It could be for the development of the Finn Harps stadium, which we are still waiting for, or it could be for something else. The problem here is that in some affluent areas of the State, there are people who are maybe more able to make those donations to support in a larger way the organisations or the clubs, but there are many areas where that is not the case. The Minister's own constituency is a case in point of where capital funding has been granted. Drumcondra AFC is an example of that. Where are they going to get the matched funding from? When we talk about sports facilities in working-class areas, the problem here is there is a wider issue.",
                "The tax code is there to support people who can actually contribute to the development of a stadium in an area or whatever it is; it could be a golf club, a tennis club or whatever else. It could be a capital project. Through the tax code, a donation can be made to support the development of that sports facility. That is good. I welcome it and I am not opposing it. The problem is when we look at the need for the sport, club or facilities in a more working-class area where fewer people are in a position to make that donation. We have projects right across the State which have been granted significant and sizeable amounts of funding that are not moving ahead because of the co-funding requirement. In some cases, these co-funding requirements will be met through measures like this that will encourage people to make a donation and the beneficiary will benefit from the fact that the individual is not claiming the relief themselves. However, that is not the case in a lot of the country. I just want to raise that point. I do not have an issue with sections 8 and 10. They will benefit sporting organisations and clubs, but the situation, if not this measure specifically, has led to an uneven playing field in relation to the development of facilities across the State. Where they are needed most, in our working-class communities, they are finding it difficult to meet the challenges of co-financing and they do not have people who are living in their locality and who are in a position to dig deep into their pockets and to make donations to those clubs of the size that is required to develop the type of facilities that are required. Obviously, people are very generous and make donations as they can. I wanted to raise that point on this section."

We are not going to go around the table and start advocating for our own clubs – I know that – but there is a general point to be made. I support the point made by Deputy Doherty.",

That is appropriate and can help with the ownership and long-term maintenance of facilities.",

It accessed sports capital funding in the past and this has played a very important role in its development. The same applies to other football, GAA and athletics clubs in Dublin Central alone and also to clubs in every other constituency. While the requirement to match funding can pose a difficulty, there are good reasons for it. The majority of clubs I am familiar with do find a way of drawing down the sports capital funding made available to them, and that is certainly the case in Dublin Central.",
                "With regard to the operation of this scheme, it is important to bring some information to bear on the discussion we are having here. At the moment, 70% of donations made to access the scheme are below €300. The full cost of the scheme in the last year for which full information is available was €800,000. The total number of taxpayer donations in 2021 was 1,289, and of those only 34 had a value greater than €1,000. Therefore, the vast majority of donations made are in the order of hundreds of euro. I imagine they are made by people associated with clubs with a view to contributing towards what is needed if the facilities are to go ahead."

The report would deal with the impact of the PRSI exemption for share-based remuneration for large corporations on the sustainability of the social insurance fund. There is no PRSI that applies to share-based remuneration. The question here is the appropriateness of that policy and whether that should be restricted to SMEs as opposed to larger companies.",
                "I note that the 2024 Indecon review on the taxation of share-based remuneration found that Ireland's PRSI exemption appeared generous compared with many countries, where such exemptions are more focused on SMEs. It is probably stemming from that finding in the report that I questioned whether we needed to look at share-based remuneration, the exemption from PRSI, and the importance of the Social Insurance Fund and that fund being able to provide supports for people in need of those supports in terms of whether this restriction should apply to SMEs. We know that, unsurprisingly, larger firms have the highest volume or value of share-based remuneration schemes. It is 83% in total. However, the growth in the micro or SME firms is disproportionately low and stagnant. If we look at micro firms, the share-based remuneration value in 2023 is at the same level as it was in 2019. The value has increased by 21% for small firms, 130% for medium firms and 139% for large firms. If you take the total value of share-based remuneration schemes at just over €2.1 billion, €1.8 million of that goes to larger firms. That comes as a substantial cost to the Social Insurance Fund. That is the proposal before us and it is worthy of consideration."

The Deputy has proposed a report on the impact of PRSI exemption for share-based remuneration for large corporations on the sustainability of the SIF.

The employer's PRSI exemption does not apply to cash, settled awards or any cash payment that follows the value of the shares.",

This review makes a number of recommendations pertaining to share-based remuneration and this exemption specifically. The review found that the PRSI exemption was regarded as an important support for SMEs and other businesses in Ireland. Recommendation No. 1 of the review suggests that a cap on the level of the employer PRSI exemption should be considered. As part of the process of determining future policy in the area, consideration is now being given to recommendations in the review. In relation to this, my Department has now engaged with relevant stakeholders and will continue to do so. Consequently, I do not consider it necessary to carry out a further review of the PRSI exemption for share-based remuneration at this time.",

While I do not believe a report on this matter is merited in the way Deputy Doherty articulated, this is a matter that I would be happy to engage with him and the committee on. I know that shares are an important part of the compensation of employers and are an important way of keeping valued workers in a company that has employed them, but I accept that there are different policy issues we have to tease out regarding the level of support that is available to those schemes, whether it is appropriate and whether it should be increased or decreased. We heard one call earlier on in relation to ESOPs - I know that was a different matter to this - and Deputy Doherty is now making a call in a different area. My takeaway on this is that it is an issue that, in general, needs more work. I would be happy to engage with the Deputy and the committee on this as we analyse further and maybe make decisions in advance of future finance Bills."

Has the Department or Revenue looked at this? Is there merit in that proposal?"

Accountable persons include Departments, commercial and non-commercial State agencies and bodies, local authorities, the HSE and authorised medical insurers. The tax only applies to payments for professional services made by the State sector and plays an important role in ensuring the tax compliance of specified persons in receipt of payments that originate from Exchequer funds.",
                "Deputies will be aware that the professional services withholding tax is a payment on account of the income tax or corporate tax liability. The extension of the professional services withholding tax to large contractors of professional services in the private sector would therefore result in no extra tax yield to the Exchequer, assuming current rates of compliance. To consider doing so would impose an administrative burden on those accountable persons required to operate the tax, the specified persons who incur the tax and Revenue, which administers the tax, provides customer service and ensures that accountable persons fulfil all their obligations in relation to the operation of the tax. Furthermore, specified persons who have incurred the professional services withholding tax and who satisfied the eligibility requirement for a repayment may submit repayment claims to Revenue but, in the meantime, could suffer from cash-flow issues as a result of moving from a situation where they currently receive full payment for their services to a situation where 20% of the payment is withheld as a withholding tax.",

The consultation will be launched in the coming weeks, in line with the announcement on budget day. This public consultation will explore opportunities to modernise, digitalise and further expand the scope of withholding taxes in general. The associated report will then be available and should address the issue raised by Deputy Doherty. For that reason, I do not propose to accept this amendment.",
                "To go to the question the Deputy raised regarding the broadening of the use of the tax, this is something the consultation would consider, but I indicated the different trade-offs in relation to that. Overall, this will not deliver a tax gain to the State. It is about the timing of cash payments, as the Deputy knows. We need to be convinced from the point of view of administration by the tax collector, and the taxpayer, there is a good rationale for doing this. We will complete that report and share it with the committee."

The rationale behind the foreign earnings deduction scheme at the time was to encourage companies, through the taxation system, to explore and find new markets and to deepen our relationships with emerging markets. The countries that have been included in the scheme have grown and expanded over different finance Bills, and there are areas the Department of enterprise and others, including IDA Ireland, have looked at as areas where we could deepen integration and increase exports to.",

I looked at the exports between Ireland and Russia; they have actually increased in the past year. The Ukrainian Embassy has reflected on that, and not in glowing terms, in relation to Ireland. This measure is about encouragement. It is not appropriate to be encouraging that type of relationship at this point. An amendment to this section, which would allow for the Minister to suspend this measure in relation to a country, through strategy, would be appropriate. It would then allow the Minister, please God, because we need this war to finish and to end, if the Minister so wished, to readmit a country into this measure.",

As I have said, if the Minister is not willing to move on that, I flag to him that I will look to bring this forward as an amendment on Report Stage. This would enable the Minister of the day to suspend a country from the list for any period of time. It could be another country on that list in the future.

As opposed to speaking down through the section, because we all know what is in the section, I will just deal with the matter that has been raised. I understand the concern colleagues have in relation to this. The setter of policy in this area is the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I am happy to consult with the Tánaiste and his officials with regard to this. In relation to the implementation of a change here, I need to gain legal advice to see if the use of a statutory instrument would be sufficient to nullify a provision in this area. On foot of this matter being raised here in the committee, I will do so. I can understand why Deputies are raising it. I have checked to see if this is being claimed in the context of Russia. For the last year that I have information available to me, which is 2023, no claimants claimed this relief for use in Russia, which I imagine is a direct consequence of the implementation of the sanctions packages that all Deputies on this committee would be supportive of, 19 rounds of which Ireland has implemented up to this date. On foot of this matter being raised, I can assure the committee that it has not been used for the last year we have information for. In the previous year, 2022, less than ten claims were made with regard to Russia. Coming out of this committee I will consult with the Department of foreign affairs on this and if the Department of foreign affairs has the view that something like this was no longer appropriate, consider what would be the best way of giving legal effect to this. I will ask my officials to engage with the Department of foreign affairs as soon as possible and I will raise this matter with the Tánaiste. It is a reasonable point for Deputies to raise. We should not have any Irish business operating in a way that is not in line with the sanctions that have been implemented. It is reasonable to therefore ask if the scheme plays any unintended role with regard to that."

What is the rationale? As the years go on, more and more of the map of the world gets coloured in as being covered, and all the rest, and that is okay. How does the pecking order work in this?

Will the Minister tease out what this means? It was a criticism of this provision in the Finance Bill in the past that the person did not necessarily have to be there solely for work reasons. People could, therefore, be going to destinations but not need to be there for work reasons. The 2022 report of the Commission on Taxation and Welfare recommended that the qualifying criteria for this foreign earnings deduction be reviewed to ensure that the measure was utilised in a manner where claimants were consistent with the original policy objective. It is fair to say that the original policy objective was to encourage businesses to explore other export market opportunities. In this provision there is no requirement for businesses' work to be related to exports at all. That is a problem. There is no limit to the sectors it applies to. My understanding of the section, and the Minister may elaborate or correct me if I am wrong, is that it is open to any employee in a business to be able to avail of this foreign earnings deduction and it does not matter if the business ever intends to export. That is an issue.",

Will the Minister specifically outline why the recommendations and concerns raised by the report of the Commission on Taxation and Welfare are not being addressed here, particularly the recommendations on limiting it to particular sectors and the need for the work to be export-related activities?"

We are guided by them in the expansion of the scheme. I very much want to avoid a situation where the scheme is made broadly available across the world, for the simple reason that we already have healthy exports to the majority of the world. Enterprise Ireland and the Department of enterprise have advised us that they believe there is potential with these two countries to deliver against the Government's aim of trade diversification and to grow our exports within those two economies.",

I understand the Deputy's point, but it is very possible for somebody representing a company to visit a market repeatedly over many years while they have no business there in order to get business there in the future. For some of the markets in which our companies operate, and I am sure the Deputy will understand this, it can take some time to develop business relationships to grow exports. For the period in which that business engagement is taking place, it is appropriate that this scheme be made available.",
                "The Deputy made a point about conditions that are being made here. My view is that an increase in remote working arrangements, which has happened, could dilute the policy intention of this relief, which, as I have said, is all about helping Irish businesses to grow exports in places they do not currently have them or where they are at a very low level. That is why we are bringing forward conditions regarding the fact that they must be present in the relevant state for the purposes of the performance of the duties of their office or employment. The amendment aims to make it so that they have to be present in this country for reasons of work, that the work relates to the location they are in and that they are present in this relevant state, and reasonably required to be so, for the performance of their duties. We have also laid down some further criteria in the scheme regarding the number of days in a tax year. We have made clearer what needs to be a qualifying day for it to be one of the days that counts."

I understand that. Let us consider a scenario, and I ask the Minister to tell me if it is feasible. Can an individual benefit from the foreign earnings deduction if the company is not involved in exporting? Let us say that I set up a company that is involved in retail. I sell products to the Irish market. Those products are produced in, for example, China, as many products are, and I have people on the ground there managing that activity for my company in Donegal or wherever. I have no intention ever to sell whatever I am selling, perhaps Leprechaun images or whatever else, in China. I have no interest in that. Therefore, I am not involved in exports. Because those people in China are employees of the company and have to be there, because they need to be hands-on and looking at what the manufacturers are doing, they are able to avail of this deduction but their activity is not export related.

That is something that Enterprise Ireland has always encouraged for Irish-based companies to set up overseas.

People availing of the deduction must be resident in Ireland and abroad doing the work in order to qualify for the scheme. While it is possible for that to happen, and I am happy to go away and examine the scheme to see if there is any evidence of it happening, from the engagement we have had with Enterprise Ireland and the Department of enterprise, all the evidence we have is of a scheme that is being implemented in line with how we would want. It is always possible that a small number of people could be operating the scheme in a way that is not in line with the spirit of it, which is what the Deputy has described. I am happy to go away and see if there is any evidence of that. However, the indication we have is that the scheme is being implemented in line with how we would want, which is to deliver market diversification and grow exports. The answer to the Deputy's question is that it is possible. If there is any evidence of it, I will certainly ask Revenue to look at it and follow up."

SARP is obviously coming to an end at the end of this year but the Minister has brought forward a proposal to continue with this measure. I find this is just a grossly unfair measure. I have made the point on numerous occasions that if a lot of members of the public knew what was contained in this section of the Finance Bill, they would be rightly annoyed. We discussed earlier how the Minister made a deliberate choice not to provide tax cuts to workers who are really struggling due to the cost of living but in this section, he is making a deliberate choice to reward 99 millionaires with a tax cut of €105,000 per year. People are gobsmacked at that idea. Nineteen of them earn over €3 million and the Minister's proposal is to give those 19 individuals a tax cut of €105,000 each year for the five years for which they can claim this. That is just madness.",
                "The number of people who claim this, from recent statistics - and it may have increased because they are increasing year on year - is 2,925 individuals but these individuals, under this new section, have to earn above €125,000. They cannot be formerly employed in the State. They have to have come from outside and have to be a key individual. There is a policy here. Multinationals have an issue with regard to wage equalisation where employees are not discommoded in terms of their take-home pay as a result of where they are located. I find this just very difficult to stomach. I could not, in all conscience, support a policy that is making millionaires richer to the tune of €105,000 of a tax cut when I know that so many people in my constituency and right across the State are really struggling to heat their homes, keep the lights on and put food on the table. They are left worse off as a result of the budget and this Finance Bill yet there is this measure here, which costs €60 million. For less than that, the Minister could have made different decisions. He could have increased the standard rate band by €200. That would have supported hundreds of thousands of workers but the Minister decided not to do it and they are the choices that are made.",
                "I know the Minister will say this is about employment and all the rest but in my view, there is no justification. The Minister is asking members of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, who I am sure will row in behind him and vote to ensure that people who are earning - in some cases, as the statistics show us - over €3 million are going to get a tax cut of €105,000. That is absolutely bizarre. It is unethical and wrong. I would not be able to walk in to my local hospital and talk to the person who is serving me a cup of tea or the nurse who may be treating me and say, \"By the way, I supported a measure that ensures some of the wealthiest in this State pay less tax than you do as a proportion of their income\". That is what it does. It allows, for somebody who is earning up to €1 million, €262,000 of their wages to be disregarded for tax purposes. It is absolutely madness. I am not supporting this. It is systematic of a Government that brings forward proposals that have an extension or deadline that keeps on getting extended and extended again. A measure that is supposed to cost a small amount of money then costs tens of millions of euro and I have no doubt this will continue to grow."

Then we see this proposal we have seen in the past number of years and we have had this discussion in Finance Bills over the past number of years where extremely wealthy individuals receive a benefit and tax break that other people, those working flat out day and night who, as I said, are living in poverty and just cannot make ends meet, could only dream of.",

However, in relation to this particular proposal, I can in no way see where he is coming from. In 2023, we know that it cost the Exchequer €56 million to give a tax cut to fewer than 3,000 of some of the most wealthy individuals in this State. We know high earners in this State already benefit from a very low maximum income tax rate relative to our EU neighbours and I do not see where the rationale comes from on this. Whether there is a rationale or not, we also know how much people are struggling at the moment and the Minister is aware of that, too. We are all aware of how much people are struggling. At a time when people are struggling this much and did not see benefits in the budget for them, they see benefits being given to people who earn this level of money. To be honest, I think most people are not actually aware that this is something that is in the budget year in, year out. If people were aware that this is in the budget year in, year out, there would be absolute uproar about it. People know much they are struggling. They can see how much their neighbours and family members are struggling yet some of the most wealthy individuals get these tax breaks.",

How can he do this in good conscience at a time when we know there are so many children, specifically, living in poverty? That does not even look at how many children are living in deprivation."

The reason I am extending this scheme is I believe that schemes like this play an important role in the retention of certain jobs and the individuals who do those jobs within our State. That, in turn, is part of the competitiveness of our economy that, in turn, creates the tax revenue we need to pay for that nurse or teacher and our public services. That is the rationale for it. I am absolutely aware of the need that is there within our society. I am aware of how hard it is for many at the moment but to have the resources to meet those needs, foreign direct investment in particular is very important to our economy. Within our economy and those companies, a certain number of jobs and the individuals who do them play an important indirect role in the total amount of jobs we have in our country and the total amount of tax revenue we are able to collect.",
                "As I put this scheme in place and continue with the extension of the scheme, albeit with modifications I have made in recent years, it is important that the House is aware of the environment we are in and of other schemes that exist across Europe that we have to be competitive with regard to. I will give three examples. In Italy at the moment, for certain jobs and the scheme they have, 50% of employment income up to €600,000 may be exempt from income tax. In Portugal, they have a scheme where relevant employment income is subject to a 20% flat rate of tax. In Malta, income from relevant employment income can be subject to a favourable 15% flat rate of tax.",
                "That is the competitive environment which we are in. There are certain jobs in certain sectors in our economy that have a disproportionate effect on jobs in Ireland and the amount of tax revenue that we collect. The tax revenue that we collect in turn creates the resources that we need to meet the needs that I am very much aware of in our society. I understand that there are equity concerns about the scheme. That is why in recent years I have made modifications to it. It is also why, every year just before the budget, I write to finance spokespeople in the Oireachtas to indicate how this scheme has operated in the previous 12 months. The nub of it is that for a small, open economy that needs a high level of tax revenue to fund public services and meet needs that are present for us, a certain number of jobs in certain sectors are really important and there is a really competitive environment around those jobs. That, in turn, is why I believe the extension of a scheme like this is merited."

At that time, the vehicles kept falling within categories A to D. The proposal in this amendment is not to do what the Minister intends to do, which is to phase out that €10,000 reduction in the OMV, but to leave it there in sections 23 and 24. I would be interested to hear the Minister's views on what the additional tax will be. This is a tax increase on individuals. What will be the tax increase for an individual as the result of the OMV eventually decreasing from €10,000 to zero in different categories of vehicles? Obviously, the benefit-in-kind will be judged on whether they fall into categories A to D, and also on the mileage they incur. Will the Minister give us some assessment in relation to that?"

Temporary changes were made to BIK in 2023 in light of the inflationary context at the time, and it is now appropriate that these changes are gradually phased out. As part of the Finance Bill 2025, the OMV deduction is being extended for three further years of assessment on a tapered basis, to end on 31 December 2028. The OMV will be reduced by €10,000 for the 2026 year of assessment, a figure that will reduce thereafter to €5,000 for the 2027 year of assessment and €2,500 for the 2028 year of assessment.",

A more strategic approach is required to give policy certainty to employers and employees. The tapering out of the temporary universal OMV relief and the introduction of a new BIK rate for zero-emission cars provides greater long-term certainty in this area. The gradual phase-out of the relief will ensure that, by 1 January 2029, BIK will revert to the structure as initially legislated for in the Finance Act 2019.",

Continuing to support fossil-fuelled vehicles through the BIK system is incompatible with delivering these targets, but I am extending the relief on a tapered basis to provide more time for employers to provide lower emission cars to employees in order to reduce BIK liability.",

The fact is that this is not just for diesel-guzzling vans and cars; it is a tax increase for an individual driving a zero-emissions electric car. I know the Minister said he could not provide the details and all that, but I presume they are easy enough to work out. Is it not the case that from next year, people can reduce the OMV by €30,000? This means that for somebody driving an electric car doing about 35,000 km, the OMV of the car will be 12% against the value of the car, which will drop from €50,000 to €20,000. What is allowed at the moment is a €30,000 reduction in the value of the car. That will go to zero over the next four years. Therefore, there will be an extra €30,000 which will be part of the calculation for benefit-in-kind. That will be over €3,500. As a result, there will be a substantial hit involved. I have just given an example of an electric vehicle with zero carbon emissions. Those driving other cars will be hit much harder. For the type of vehicle that costs €50,000, there will be an increase in benefit-in-kind, a notional amount, of €3,600 over the next number of years as a result of this section.",
                "This amendment would not stop the tapering that is already legislated for in previous Finance Acts, but it would stop the tapering in this Bill. That is what it disrupts. It disrupts the fact that the €10,000 will not be reduced over the next number of years."

The answer to that question is \"Yes\", because the OMV is coming down. On the other hand, we are bringing in a new rate of BIK, the A1 rate, which, over time and after this OMV issue has been phased out, will result in a more attractive tax code for the use of carbon-neutral vehicles.",

However, while Deputy Doherty's proposal would just defer what we are doing, this is the second year in which we have looked to defer it. I am not looking to remove the €10,000 in a single go. I am extending it for a further year and phasing it out over time. We run the real risk that if we do not eventually make a decision like this, the difficulty of getting anywhere close to our EV targets will only continue to grow. From the analysis that has been done, we know that one of the areas in our economy in which we are furthest from where we need to be in emissions reductions is that relating to private transport. I accept that there are difficulties and trade-offs involved. That is why we are looking to phase it out over a number of years and why I believe the approach that we have taken in this Bill is the appropriate one."

The example I gave of an extra €3,600 of notional pay as a result in benefit-in-kind is for that category of car. If it was another category of car, it would actually be higher. However, as the Minister said to Deputy Farrell, on the basis of the Schedule, somebody driving a category D car would actually pay a lower percentage if they increase their mileage compared with somebody driving an A1 car on lower mileage. There are anomalies there when we look at it from an environmental point of view. A category D car is obviously one that emits far more carbon. I wanted to make that point first in relation to the tax increase that we are seeing here, which is not a couple of hundred euro. We are talking about thousands here, which is a significant amount for individuals to pay over the next number of years.",
                "When the Minister says the reduction has been deferred for a number of years, the point I would make is that even if this amendment were to be accepted, we would still see a reduction in the OMV. The sliding scale is already there in the legislation. It is going down from €30,000 to €20,000 to €10,000. That is happening anyway. The point is that this temporary additional reduction was brought in. When this was attempted initially, people obviously identified that they would be hit with serious tax bills. Most people will not notice this, but it is mad when we think about what is happening. The Minister has introduced a tax package of €2.5 billion for a full year. That is the full-year effect of the package contained within this Bill. The Minister introduced a budget of €9.4 billion.",
                "This is just another example of how people are going to be worse off next year than they were the previous year or the year after. There are plenty of examples of that in this Bill. I think it is the wrong approach to take, that we would start to see a lowering of this €10,000 temporary reduction from 2027. The scale that we have needs to be reassessed. I made the point about the 1 million electric vehicles. I do not think we are anywhere on target to meet that policy objective, which is s noble one, but really there is no point in plucking numbers out of the sky, saying this is what we are going to do, and then not planning to do it. This is a tax increase on people on drive, not just people who drive electric vehicles, but it is also a tax increase on people who drive electric vehicles at a time when we are really trying to encourage them and businesses to move in that direction, because businesses are involved in buying them in the first instance."

It is understandable that the issue was not addressed in the Finance Bill a few weeks after that, given that the political system was attending to other matters. The Department has had a year to examine this issue. I am particularly drawn to the point Dr. de Buitléir made in his report that it is imperative that this be tackled urgently. We are well aware that this can be a particular issue in certain areas of the public service, most notably for the recruitment and retention of senior gardaí.

Will he establish whether the recommendations from Donal de Buitléir's report will be addressed at any point soon?"

                "The Minister has increased the standard fund threshold to €2.8 million. I have raised concerns in relation to this in the past because obviously that is a huge windfall for people who are able to amass a pension pot of that nature. Again, the vast majority of people in the State are not going to get a whiff of a €2.8 million pension pot. What he has done in relation to the standard fund threshold will mean that the State will support individuals building up a pension pot to €2.8 million, but after that the support stops. I really question whether it is appropriate for the State to contribute to somebody's pension pot when it has reached that level.",
                "My answer in that regard is \"No\". That is my view. There is obviously a requirement for ongoing support, for the State to support the pensions of individuals, and, therefore, tax relief is appropriate. However, there must be a question as to the point at which you stop giving that support. The Minister has taken the position that people can avail of pension pots up to €2.8 million. That is what my amendment considers. It looks at a report on the issue of the standard fund threshold, clearly outlining how much it is going to cost, because let us call a spade a spade: the numbers coming from the Minister and the Department are wishful thinking. If they think that this measure is going to cost €10 million, it is laughable. There is going to be behavioural change as a result of this measure.",
                "What we are talking about in Deputy Brennan's amendment is separate. These are individuals who have no option but that the contribution is made. We are now going to have people who put money into their pensions. These would be higher wealth individuals, obviously. They are going to put money into their pensions and when their pension reaches €2.2 million, they will stop doing so because they will be hit by the chargeable excess tax. That is going to change now. Therefore, there is going to be a larger cost to the State as a result of the measures that were introduced. We sometimes have fake rows about what things cost or getting costings wrong, but there is no way that this measure will cost only €10 million.",
                "We talked earlier about SARP and how it benefited to the tune of €105,000 some of the highest paid individuals. That measure in terms of the standard fund threshold will benefit people to the tune of €325,000 of a tax reduction. That is mental stuff. At that level, the supports should not be given. Those are my points on the amendment.",
                "I will move to the issue of Deputy Brennan's proposal, which, as he indicated, is the proposal that exists in the de Buitléir report. He looked at how to deal with recruitment and retention for the higher levels of the public sector in particular. It was mentioned earlier that the Garda, in particular, was in focus in that regard. One of the ways to do that is to deal with age-related factors. There are a number of ways to do this. We need to deal with it. These are individuals who are not personally contributing. There is obviously a deduction that is going into a pension pot. However, these are notional payments, as such. When you have a defined benefit pension, the value of your pension pot is calculated using an age-related factor, which did not exist 15 years ago. The factors that exist today did not exist 15 years ago. It was a smaller factor and was not age-related. The age-related factor makes sense because the earlier you retire, the longer you will benefit from the pension. Therefore, the notional value of your pension pot is increased.",
                "The Garda has fast-accumulating pensions and gardaí must retire at a certain age. They have to retire at the age of 63. I am not sure if that is the correct age, but they have to retire at a certain time. They are in a situation whereby the age-related factor hits them harder because they are not able to work on. Deputy Nash talked about the Judiciary. Members of the Judiciary are entitled to work on and, therefore, the age-related factor does not impact them or make it as difficult.",
                "My view is that we should not be increasing the standard fund threshold. I know the Minister will say that increasing the standard fund threshold will assist a number of these individuals. That is correct. I do not think what the Minister has done will address the issue in totality. We are talking here about individuals at the higher end with large defined pensions. We are talking about at least 80,000 people hitting the standard fund threshold as it exists, never mind where it is going. We are talking about people in very senior roles. We are talking about a small cohort. To move the standard fund threshold to deal with them is madness. If I were an adviser to anybody with wealth, I would say that the first thing to do is to put money into a pension. That is what advisers tell people to do. The State is going to pay 40% of what you put in. If your pension pot is worth €2 million, the Minister has now allowed you to put it up to €2.8 million, with a tax reduction of €325,000. That is what people with wealth would do and that is what will happen. It will cost the State a lot of money. It is not the way to resolve the issue in relation to very senior people who, as a result of the way the defined benefit pension is calculated, have pensions that will hit the standard fund threshold amount.",
                "There are two other ways to do it. One is to exempt a category of employees from the standard fund threshold. That could be considered. The second way, as Deputy Brennan has suggested, is to deal with the age-related factor, which is what the de Buitléir report suggested. There is absolutely no doubt that we have to deal with this.",
                "This measure applies to all defined benefit pensions. When these measures were introduced, there were a lot of defined benefit pensions in the private sector. There are not many any more. Defined benefit pensions are primarily in the public sector. This a broader issue and most of the defined benefit pensions in the public sector will not hit the standard fund threshold. Within our own ranks, you would have to be a Minister for a number of years to reach the standard fund threshold. We are talking about very senior civil servants. Most people in the health and education systems will not hit the threshold at this point.",
                "This proposal could work if it captures the individuals we are talking about. Is there a group of defined pensions within the private sector that would benefit? Is there an ability for defined pensions to re-emerge in the private sector because of the treatment they would receive as a result of the relevant age-related factor? As we know, there are valid reasons, particularly after the crash, that so many people moved away from defined benefit to defined contribution.",
                "I have said a lot on this but I wanted to make my points about the standard fund threshold. The issue in Deputy Brennan's amendment affects a small cohort of individuals. There is an absolute need to deal with it. Because we are talking about a small number of individuals, surely to God we can find a way of dealing with the issue."

                "I thank the Deputies. I will speak to both amendments as they both relate to the standard fund threshold, which sets the maximum amount for tax-relieved pension at retirement.",
                "Where a pension exceeds the SFT, the excess over the threshold is subject to an upfront, ring-fenced income tax charge at 40%. The SFT forms part of the taxation framework for pensions that applies to all pensions in the public and private sector. It has remained unchanged since 2014. In that context, it is timely to consider the review of it.",
                "In December 2023 an independent expert, Dr. Donal de Buitléir, was appointed to carry out a targeted review of the SFT regime. The report makes a number of recommendations to modernise and update the operation of the SFT, which reflects developments in the pensions landscape and the impact of wage growth since 2014. It considers the level of the SFT, the rate of tax payable and the method of valuing benefits for the application of the SFT regime and makes significant recommendations for reform in these areas. It also makes several recommendations regarding the operation of the regime in relation to encashment, pension adjustment orders and the reporting of chargeable excess tax, CET, as well as for changes in the methodology for estimating the cost of pension tax expenditures. In relation to the level of the SFT, the report recommends that the current value of the SFT be increased in line with the increase in the earnings, hours and employment costs surveys, with most recent data suggesting a new level of €2.8 million. It also recommends ongoing automatic adjustment of the SFT in line with future earnings increases. In addition, the report proposes that the link between the SFT and the amount of a lump sum that is taxable at the standard rate of tax should be removed.",
                "The Finance Act 2024 modified three specified aspects of the regime, the first two of which were designed to implement the recommendations in relation the level of the SFT while the third was a technical change. The first revision provided for increases in the SFT to €2.2 million in 2026, €2.4 million in 2027, €2.6 million in 2028 and €2.8 million in 2029. After that, the level of the SFT will increase in line with earnings growth between 2025 and 2029. From 2031 there will be an automatic adjustment in line with earnings growth. In a year which shows a decrease in average earnings, the SFT will remain the same as the previous year. The first increase in the level of the SFT will be for the year of assessment 2026, when the SFT will be raised to €2.2 million.",
                "The objective of these reforms was to put in place a more equitable treatment between public and private sector pensions and to ensure that the SFT regime reflects wage growth since it was last reviewed in 2014. It is important to acknowledge that the CET is an additional tax levied on top of the normal income tax, USC and possibly PRSI that apply when a pension is drawn down.",
                "The second revision provided that the threshold for the higher rate of taxation to apply to a pension lump sum is €500,000 rather than a proportion of the standard fund threshold. This means that the threshold will not increase as the level of the SFT rises.",
                "Finally, Finance Act 2024 addressed an anomaly with respect to the application of the SFT where an individual has more than one PRSA, to put beyond doubt that such transfers from a PRSA which is not a vested PRSA, to a vested PRSA, are considered a benefit crystallisation event, BCE, and will, therefore, be subject to the SFT.",
                "Deputy Brennan has proposed that the current table of age-related valuation factors in schedule 23B to the Taxes Consolidation Act be replaced with a table of new and lower valuation factors which correspond to those proposed in Dr. de Buitléir’s report. As was outlined by the Minister for Finance at the time the report was published in September 2024, the Government agreed that an independent evaluation of the proposed valuation factors which apply to defined benefit pensions be carried out by the Society of Actuaries, SOA. The SOA subsequently undertook this independent evaluation and indicated that the proposed valuation factors were appropriate.",
                "However, as I said before, budgets are about choices. As indicated on budget day, the purpose of budget 2026 is to boost our economic resilience and to keep our public finances safe. In this context, the scope for significant personal tax changes is limited, thus explaining why from an equity perspective I am not bringing forward further changes to the SFT regime in this year’s Finance Bill. I am open to considering the future application of the recommendations. In this regard, an implementation group has been convened to consider further Dr. de Buitléir’s report. It is chaired by the Department of Finance with representatives from Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Justice, Home Affairs and Migration, the Department of Social Protection and the Department of public expenditure. The group has commenced its examination of the recommendations and will report in quarter 2 of 2026. At that point, I will consider further the impact of the recommendations with a view to deciding how they can best be addressed in the context of broader considerations. Given the work of the interdepartmental evaluation group and taking into consideration that Finance Act 2024 provided for a graduated increase in the SFT which will commence in 2026, I am not in a position to accept this recommendation.",
                "Deputies Doherty and Farrell then proposed that I prepare a report on the costs of increasing the SFT to €2.8 million and that it be prepared and laid before the Dáil. There are difficulties in relation to the costing of changes to the SFT. Information on the numbers and values of individual pension funds or on individual accrued benefits in pension schemes are not generally required to be supplied to the Revenue Commissioners. There is, therefore, no underlying data or methodology available to Revenue on which to base reliable estimates of the full cost that would arise specifically from a change to the SFT. However, in the context of the examination of the SFT and my intention to implement the recommendations in relation to increasing the SFT, my officials examined the issue of examining the impact of changes to the SFT using only the available information about previous payments of chargeable excess tax. Indicative estimated costs were prepared and they were shared with Deputy Doherty and others in the House in response to parliamentary questions on this matter, most recently on 21 October. Using this model, the indicative estimated costing of increasing the standard fund threshold proposed by the Government is as follows: for 2026, an indicative cost of €10.5 million; for 2027 an indicative cost of €14.5 million; the following year an indicative cost of €8 million; and for 2029 an indicative cost of €5 million.",
                "While the change in the SFT for 2030 is not set and will depend on the change in earnings over the period 2025 to 2029, an estimated cost of €0.5 million has been included in the costing for this change. However, I accept that these estimated costs do not take account of behavioural changes and are based on a reduction of the current CET yield. Any assessment of behavioural changes would be speculative but I accept they are there. I am not convinced of the value of doing such an exercise.",
                "I have also shared with the House through responses to parliamentary questions the fact that we do not have exact figures regarding the number of individuals who have paid CET. In addition, the data that is available is currently being verified and it is not possible to provide exact figures for the numbers who have paid CET and the amounts paid. I would note that the information that is available indicates that there were over 200 returns of CET through RevPay in 2023. However, I am advised that pension administrators sometimes make bulk payments and therefore some payments may relate to more than one taxpayer. This figure would also not include situations where the retirement benefit exceeded the SFT in those years but where the chargeable excess tax due was reduced to nil by being offset against tax paid on a retirement lump sum. The amount of CET reported in 2023 was €39.6 million.",
                "It is also not possible to provide an estimate of the number of people that will benefit from the increases in the SFT.",
                "The numbers of the SFT mean there are many variables that affect the value of retirement benefits when it is being compared to the SFT, and the valuation will depend on the individual's circumstances. Individuals can choose to retire at a range of ages and for a variety of reasons, therefore it is not possible to forecast how many will retire in 2029, with an SFT of between €2 million and €2.8 million, and not possible to provide a figure regarding the number of taxpayers who might benefit from this change, which is why I believe a report at this point would not be useful and which is why I will not accept the amendment. I should indicate that in any changes to this area it is not possible to ring-fence the SFT to certain workers or cohorts. I have examined that matter and any changes in this area would apply to all workers who are in this situation."

There was a consultation going back two years, we had the de Buitléir report as has been mentioned and there are serious challenges, albeit for a small cohort of individuals, which we have an obligation to try to resolve. The Minister made the point we cannot differentiate but we already do it. It already exists in the Irish tax code under how the chargeable excess is actually paid. Our tax provision already differentiates between private sector individuals and public sector individuals in a quite significant way. I think it is section 787TA that provides a facility for members of public sector pensions arrangements whereby the tax liability from the chargeable excess can be discharged over a period of 20 years and, on the death on an individual, the chargeable excess dies with him or her, that is, the remaining part that was never paid. Whereas for a private individual, the tax code makes it clear he or she has to pay chargeable excess within three months of the crystallisation and there is no refund if the individual passes away within the next month or year. I want to make that point that our tax code does allow, and has facilitated unencumbered provisions that differentiate between public sector employees and private individuals on the issue of the chargeable excess. My argument and contention is, and I am not saying this about Deputy Brennan's proposal because I want to hear some of the answers, that is definitely one way of addressing that issue. I want to make sure there are no unintended consequences but there are other ways of doing it as well where we can actually bring forward provisions, as has been done in relation to certain types of employees in terms of the chargeable excess."

The main difference is that public sector workers are permitted to spread their CET over 20 years and the reason is that the State administers the pension, and that option is not available for individuals in the private sector. However, this is something that needs examination and consideration. The advice I have received very clearly on the use of any change of the age related factors is that it would apply to all workers, that is, to anybody who is in that pension scheme, and that it is not possible to ring-fence particular groups of workers. If there was a way in which this could be ring-fenced, we might well be having a different discussion but it is applicable to anybody who has a pension to which these arrangements apply."

What I do not have any of the detail of are those who have defined pensions, or, the right, because if the CET is crystallised it is already dealt with. The tax has been paid or the individual is in an arrangement to pay the tax. The question is, how many people have a right to a defined pension at this point in time? How many of those have the right to a defined pension that would be in excess of the standard fund threshold? If we are looking at these age related factors, yes they apply to all workers. The change would apply to a nurse in my local hospital or the teacher in my local school but it will not make a difference to them because they will not hit the standard fund threshold anyway and there is no chance of them doing so. How many people would the de Buitléir proposal capture? The vast majority, I assume - and assumptions can be worrying, which is why I am asking the question - will be public sector workers who have defined pensions. I do not know how many in the private sector are still offering defined pensions.",
                "There is a second option. This proposal applies to everybody and that is why I want the information as to how widely it could apply or what the unintended consequences could be. Given that we have already differentiated in our tax code in relation to pensions and the chargeable excess from public sector pensions and private sector pensions, then it will be possible to also take that further. I am not suggesting this is the proposal but could there be a higher standard fund threshold for a public sector employee? Could there be a different age related factor? It would not be this amendment, it would have to be changed. For a defined contribution in respect of public sector workers - who are able to avail of what section 787 of the tax code does, which is to expand or pay their CET over a period of 20 years - it was obviously permissible in law to differentiate between two different types of individuals who both have a tax liability. Therefore, is it permissible, notwithstanding how this is drafted or what was recommended, to look at a carve-out for those who have fast-accruing pensions whereby, because of the onus the State placed on them to retire at a certain stage, that should not be captured in terms of the CET?"

It is estimated that 124 individuals will have a fund valuation of the average of €2.58 million, 50 individuals will have a fund valuation of €2.2 million and a further 50 individuals will have a fund valuation of €3 million.

It would raise really fundamental equity issues regarding how different groups are being treated. That is one of the reasons, and is in fact a key reason, that I believe treating different groups or workers differently with regard to an age-related factor would not be possible."

                "Okay. Going back to the issue, I hear what the Minister has said about the age-related factor regarding public sector workers and that may be a stretch. I do not know if the Minister has got the Attorney General's advice to suggest whether it is allowable or not. Has he looked at other options, for example, to allow some of these employees to opt out? They have got a defined pension so, therefore, they have a right to the pension of €70,000 or €80,000 when they retire. The problem is that for as long as they work, they keep on building up a pot, even though the pot means nothing to them because they have the right to this pension. It is a kind of notional pot in a way but if that pot goes over a certain point, they have a big tax liability. That tax liability could be hundreds of thousands of euro. I think the media reported that one individual might have a tax liability of €1 million. I am not sure if that is chargeable, in excess of €1 million. The tax liability might be a bit less than that. Has the Minister looked at options where some individuals might be able to opt out, or a carve-out for certain workers? That is not the age-related thing but a complete carve-out for certain employees."

The problem is that this issue has been going around for quite a while. It has problems. What the Minister is telling us here is that after we had an expert looking at this issue and coming up with recommendations, we are now going to have another expert group coming up with this and looking at recommendations. It is going to be another year, at least, before anything is dealt with, with no actual certainty that anything is going to be dealt with. This report was published a year ago.

I have outlined that for equity reasons overall in the budget, I believed it was not a decision that should be made now. I know that when you consider other options in regard to this, it will come back to the age-related factors. I know that because this has been looked at for some time and I am familiar with how it operates. I equally know that with regard to saying we can apply the age-related factors to particular cohorts or groups of workers or particular levels within our public sector, we will not be able to do that. It will have to be done for everyone. This is an interesting discussion to have had and it will be useful to come back to this issue later on in the year, particularly when we do further consideration of this.",

That would cause real issues of equity with lots of other people where we ask them to continue to pay into their pension scheme - real, serious issues. Again, it is worth evaluating that when we are thinking about how this issue could be dealt with."

Second, while it is not where I think we should be at, the Minister said he is going to go away and look at this. There is an expert group being established again - another one. When are we likely to see proposals coming forward in relation to this matter? Is it in the mouth of the Finance Bill? Is it early next year that would give an indication of where the direction of travel is? When are we likely to see something? For us in the Opposition, data are absolutely crucial to being able to formulate a policy and say whether this is worth doing or captures a broader audience, which is not the intention and is therefore not worth doing."

I have brought a number of amendments over successive Committee Stages of various Finance Bills to try to achieve that objective. It is a positive way in which we can address vacancy and dereliction. The Minister will know well that the initial scheme was introduced in the early 2010s and only came into effect in about 2015, having spent quite a considerable amount of time being examined by the European Commission in terms of state aid rules and so on.",
                "The number of changes the Minister proposed to the scheme are very positive in terms of the inclusion of properties that are dated prior to 1975. There are various other changes proposed to the scheme that will have a positive impact. Local authorities will now be required to develop and map special regeneration zones - areas in which the scheme will be applicable. It makes sense where there are business improvement district schemes that local authorities would actually use those particular areas and have them readily available. If that could be used to expedite the implementation of the scheme in areas like Drogheda and Dundalk, that would be useful.",

I was involved in getting the one in my own hometown up and running a number of years ago. It may be the case that some of the local authorities have already been in touch with the Department to urge that approach. Vacancy and dereliction are an absolute scourge. They are a real problem and I could speak at length about some of the things we need to do to address the issue.",

                "I would like to see Revenue collecting the proposed new derelict sites tax as early as possible. If it is in order, the Minister might comment on his plans in that regard. To the best of my recollection, he will be required to introduce a series of statutory instruments once the special regeneration areas have been mapped in order to ensure that the scheme can become operational.",
                "Two questions arise. First, when does the Minister expect the scheme to come into operation and when will he be in a position to sign those statutory instruments. Second, will the Minister provide an update - or his best guess at least - as to when Revenue will be in a position to start collecting the derelict sites tax? I know there is an amount of work to be done in preparation. Ideally, it should be up and running as soon as possible. I have always made the point that local authorities and their demands around the derelict sites levies are simply ignored. Their attempts to collect some of these levies are frustrated. For those people who are wealthy enough to allow a building to become vacant or derelict and not sweat the asset, the only language they understand is a letter from the Revenue making a demand. If they are not tax compliant, they cannot operate their businesses. This is an extremely positive initiative that we have been calling on for years. The two areas are in a way connected."

                "I thank the Cathaoirleach. I will answer the Deputy's different questions. From a timing point of view, this is really dependent on the local authorities. The Deputy makes a very interesting point regarding the parameters relating to the business investment district already being in place. That certainly would appear to me to be a sensible position to start from or even, more ideally, to conclude with. If I have learned anything about the application of measures like this - and I have a lot of experience in this now and with the residential zoned land tax - it is that once we get into the territory of asking local authorities to conduct mapping exercises it takes longer than one expects and it generates all kinds of issues which it did not consider, particularly when the maps begin to expand. This relates to the other question, which I will come to, regarding the period involved in the application of the derelict sites tax, which I will deal with.",
                "There are five local authorities that are going to be able to benefit from the expansion of this scheme, two of which are within the Deputy's constituency. I certainly hope that the local authorities will be pragmatic and will try and get this work done reasonably quickly. We, in turn, should try to turn it around at our end as quickly as possible. On a timeframe in relation to this, it depends on how much change happens with regard to the map. It is certainly our intention that we would get all of this up and running in a year. We will do it quicker if we can but we are dependent on the maps that come in from local authorities.",
                "On the scheme, I will just generally make the point that the changes we have made here have real potential to make an impact on the issue of dereliction. I am very hopeful that if we work with local authorities, we will see properties that are currently vacant and derelict, particularly those that are above commercial properties that are empty, being incentivised for use by this scheme. While every word and detail we bring forward about schemes like this is pored over by people who might benefit or those who might advise them, I draw the committee's attention to the great efforts we have made to ensure that the part of this initiative that refers to living over the shop or changing commercial into residential use has an impact. The fact that a building age rule does not apply to this part of the scheme should mean that it will have a big impact in areas that are included within the maps. I really hope this will have an impact on the issue of dereliction, which we all know is having such an effect on the standard of living, on access to homes, and a big effect on the feel that towns and cities have, which we all want to see improve.",
                "On the length of time for the implementation of the derelict property tax, we really want to get this up and running as soon as we can. With all the learnings we have had, I expect it will be 2027 before we get to a point where we have preliminary registers in place. Having considered this matter a lot in the past number of months, the main reason is that there is such an uneven application of the current derelict property registers by local authorities. There are many local authorities that will have a lot of work to do. A target of 2027 for a preliminary register is still going to be demanding. This is such a big issue and we have tried everything else so it is an appropriate deadline. As soon as those preliminary registers in are in place, we will move as quickly as possible to implement the tax.",
                "There is only one point on which I would respectfully differ from the Deputy. This is an issue we will have to consider. There is no doubt that there are groups of derelict properties that people allow to become derelict and they can afford to do so. For those people, there is a really clear message that the Revenue Commissioners will be collecting this tax. There will be a register in relation to those properties that will be in effect for 2027. It will be in the best interests of everybody that they avoid being on this register in the first place and that they get these properties into a good condition in order that people can live in them. There are a number of properties that are derelict for reasons other than choice. I have no doubt that when we go to implement this tax, we will experience properties that are derelict where it is not clear who owns them. There will be complex stories behind those individual properties. Personal difficulties may well come to light as well. That will all be there, but we still have to try something different because what we are doing is not working in the way it should."

It is a scourge that affects every community. The Minister said quite correctly that dereliction is complex. I do not pretend that it is not. We have been dealing with this in my community for a long time. We are trying to come up with innovative ways in which this problem can be addressed. We encounter all of the time questions over ownership. Properties are in probate for a period of time and maybe it is difficult to establish who the owner is. However, these are not the people we are necessarily concerned about. Those problems are objective facts. There are situations where people allow their properties to simply go to rack and ruin and they then become public health and public safety problems. The Administration in Scotland has declared dereliction to be a public health issue. If we map it, we will see that for lots of different reasons, dereliction is particularly pronounced in areas that are marginalised. We need to look at this problem through that lens as well.",
                "One area we also need to discuss and properly interrogate is initiatives that have been taken elsewhere, such as those, for example, in countries that have introduced compulsory sales orders. Compulsory purchase orders can be a challenge. A number of years ago, a law review group came up with proposals to streamline the process relating to such orders. The Minister for housing is looking at that at the moment.",
                "The question of how we go about compulsory purchase orders also is an important issue. In my view, with regard to dereliction and property more generally, we need to look at the public interest factor rather than the primacy of private property because this has got out of hand and is causing real problems in the middle, as we are all aware, of a housing crisis. For many different reasons and in particular from a sustainability point of view, it is much easier to turn around an existing property than to build on a new site. On those sites where there are derelict properties, the chances are there are services already available that can be easily plugged into to accommodate people. In terms of the proposals the Minister has made in the context of this Bill, and changes to the living cities initiative, the living over the shop proposal is very positive in terms of breathing new life back into our towns and city centres. That is really important.",
                "I take the point the Minister made in relation to the onus and obligation on local authorities to deal with this efficiently. I have made a proposal and I hope that it flies with local authorities. As I said earlier, my own local authority is interested in using the existing business improvement district scheme zone and applying it in terms of the operation of this scheme. That may short-circuit and address any complications the Department may be anticipating. The Minister is absolutely right. When we start remapping areas, it could go on forever. It is subject to lobbying and so on from individuals. That is the clearest and cleanest way to deal with it. I thank the Minister for his response. This is a welcome initiative."

What we need to make sure of is that we ramp up how we deal with these sites, because of the housing crisis we are trying to deal with, but also because of the services that so many different communities simply do not have. I am talking about health services and all those kinds of things. We need to have this as a priority for the Government to look at. If the Minister is serious about tackling this kind of vacancy, we need to make sure we have all the data on vacancy and dereliction and we can at least then fully monitor exactly what is happening. As someone who campaigned heavily on the former Corrib Great Southern Hotel site, I found it was very difficult to get any information required to be able to try to push it ahead. I am worried this is something that has now become the norm and people feel that with those sites that is the way they are, rather than seeing the potential they have. We all want to live in cities that can live up to the potential they have. I wanted to say that as it is very close to my heart but also something I see in my own local area."

When I am in my constituency going door to door, I come across well-built homes that have been empty for 20 or 30 years. I appreciate there are complexities around why that happens but it is not a situation that can be tolerated. It should not be tolerated under any circumstances but with the gravity of the housing crisis we have, there is no justification for it.",

People were telling me they were owned by the local authority. I thought it could not be true that the worst, most derelict homes in the area were owned by the local authority. It turned out they were, and that the four had been empty for a collective period of approximately 60 years. I got that changed as a local councillor and they were put back into use a few years later. Families are now living there and they have been put to great use. However, it shows the institutional attitude around this in the past that the worst offender in a community as regards dereliction was actually a local authority. That has changed and it is welcome.",

I urge the Minister, who clearly is committed on this, that when he does encounter difficulties, challenges and complexities during the implementation of the process, to hold firm as it is so important."

We have had numerous iterations of and changes to this, such as accelerated reliefs. It started off as ten years and it is now seven. We had additional cities and maps changed and still the number of claimants is quite low. The cost of this is €1 million or something like that. It is very small in relation to the actual figure. The figure I have for 2022 is 89 claimants at a cost of €1.1 million. The changes the Minister is bringing forward are quite substantial. The fact the Bill has moved from pre-1915 to pre-1975 buildings is very significant. It is a huge expansion.",
                "I had to pop out to speak in the Dáil so if I am asking questions that have been asked and answered I will look back at the transcripts later but if not, I ask the Minister to talk to us about why he chose 1975 as a point in time. We know that if we look at the housing stock within the State, of all houses in the State, 9% was built before 1919. By expanding this to 1975, we take in another 23%, that is, one quarter of housing stock. That obviously does not apply across the State but within the designated areas. Nonetheless, it is quite significant.",
                "I diverge, but when we look at this graph, we can see that 25% of our existing housing stock was built within ten years. It shows how terribly the Government has been doing over the past while when housing is a crisis. We have the ability to really wrap it up but that is another issue.",
                "This is quite a large expansion, so will the Minister tell us why the year 1975 was identified? Also, the Minister is allowing for commercial premises that are developed into rented residential elements. The commercial and rented residential elements are now being amended to allow for an enhanced capital relief system of over two years, as opposed to seven years for the rest. What is the policy consideration for that? If the Minister believes it is necessary to go to two years for those elements, why not have two years for everything? I am not advocating for two years for everything but am interested in the assessment the Department has made.",
                "In regard to the age profile of these buildings, I hear what colleagues have said abut dereliction. I know Letterkenny is to be added to this and I will speak about that in a second. There are derelict buildings, particularly in parts of the centre of Letterkenny. One derelict building creates a situation where we end up with more and more of them. This will apply to buildings that are not derelict as well but are now being upgraded and refurbished for residential or rental elements above a shop, or indeed an entire commercial building being changed into residential, as far as I understand. In terms of commercial to residential, there are no age limits whatsoever. Will the Minister explain his thinking on that? I think the legislation talks about the rateable premises. Does that mean that, within the catchment area, a commercial building that was built maybe two years ago and is rateable could actually avail of this? Could the person who built the commercial building and left it as a shell avail of this? Could a person who is building a commercial building today avail of this scheme in two years' time to benefit from the living city initiative, because there is an extension to five years? They may leave the upper part of the building gutted to allow for the refurbishment to be able to fall under this scheme which allows for up to €300,000 of an allowance in terms of their tax bill?",
                "When we dealt with all of the variations of the initiative, there were very clear anti-avoidance mechanisms put into this, and that mechanism was that developers and connected parties were not able to benefit from this. That has now changed. Developers and connected parties will be able to benefit from this in certain circumstances. Will the Minister speak to that? There are quite a number of questions there but I am sure the officials have taken a note of them.",
                "In regard to the designation of the new areas, obviously we are dealing with the Finance Bill and the Minister announced in the budget that a number of other areas, including Letterkenny, Sligo, Dundalk, Athlone and Drogheda will be included in this. I am interested to hear why those areas were selected. I know all of the areas, but I know some of them well, or better than others. There is absolutely a need for regeneration in parts of those areas but I also know towns that are not too far away from them that equally need the same. If the Minister believes in this, why are we not applying this more broadly?"

I fully agree with him regarding the maps and I hope the expedition of these maps in a timely way by local authorities will in turn allow us to implement the changes we are making here. What we have been doing up to this point has not worked in the way I want it to and we need it to. With the combination of changes we have made, I am making it available to five more cities in order to do more to tackle the issue of dereliction and the use of property that is already built.",
                "The Cathaoirleach reminded us of the really significant issues we have in relation to the use of properties that are derelict or vacant. It is the case that this changed scheme will still have real focus and limit to it, from a geographical point of view. I suspect it is the case that some of the property the Deputy is referring to will still be excluded from it. It is the reason we also have the urban regeneration development fund, which is a fund of €150 million that does aim to support plans that can end dereliction and long-term vacancy. We also have the croí cónaithe fund which provides a grant of up to €50,000 or €70,000 for vacant properties. We also have the vacant property refurbishment grant, with 9,979 grants having been approved at the moment and a further 2,856 having been paid out to a value of €155 million. I am just making the point that while we are understandably focusing on the living city initiative today, there are other schemes that are spending-related and aim to make a difference to this.",
                "In relation to Deputy O'Callaghan and his point about local authority homes that have become voids, a void is just a description for properties owned by local government that do not have anybody living in them and have decayed over time. I have seen the same thing myself. In fairness, it has been an area of focus for the Department of housing and more funding has been made available to quickly turn properties that local authorities own into homes. While I cannot speak to the Deputy's constituency, I can see within Dublin Central now the number of homes that have been owned by the local authority that are now being turned into liveable homes and have people living in them. I greatly welcome that and want to see that progress continue.",
                "I have taken a note of the questions Deputy Doherty has put to me. First, we have not expanded the maps or cities for some time. This is the first revision of the cities that has happened for many years. Even in what I am doing here today, I am not proposing a revision of the maps for existing areas that are in the scheme because I believe that would be a counterproductive thing to do, given all the other experience I have had with maps and the need for mapping from local authorities. It is some time now since we have had any significant revisions to the scheme and there has been no change for many years with regard to the cities or maps.",
                "On the point about why we went to 1975, it previously stood at 1915, as Deputy Doherty said. The aim was to try to maximise the number of properties within the existing parameters of the scheme that would benefit from this because of the shift in gear we need in regard to the use of these properties. To bring some figures to it, at the moment, the number of properties that qualify within the existing special regeneration areas is 14,000 properties. We estimate that will rise to 34,000 properties. That is not the same thing as saying all of these properties would then access the scheme but that is the number of properties that qualify for it.",
                "As a result of the decision that we have now made with regard to so-called regional centres, that will further increase it by another 7,000 properties, bringing the number of properties that will be applicable to the scheme up to 41,000. It is currently 14,000.",
                "On why the owner-occupier provision is able to be drawn down over a seven-year period, owner-occupied properties will be set against either PAYE income tax or the self-employed tax. For that reason that is applicable over a seven-year period, whereas commercial and residential properties will be applicable only over a two-year period.",
                "The Deputy noted that private developers will be able to access the scheme. That is the case because the private sector is going to play a role in dealing with the issue of dereliction, but I have made the point that the maximum that is applicable under a property here in this scheme is €300,000 per undertaking due to the application of our state aid rules. A cap is in place regarding the maximum that can be drawn down in relation to this per undertaking. Yes, I am bringing the development sector into the operation of this scheme because I am trying to use, in a targeted and responsible way, the tax code to make a difference to the availability of homes within city centres, recognising that tax in a targeted way can play a role with regard to it.",
                "On the point made about the number of areas, they are informed by the designation of regional centres within the national planning framework, and the national planning framework lays out a number of cities that are classed as regional centres. I am using that classification to expand the scheme.",
                "That leads to the question put to me on whether I believe in it. I do believe in the changes that we are making. As for why we do not do more and not expand the maps further and bring more cities into it, there is still a balance we need to strike. These are significant changes that are being made here. I believe that changes of this nature should be targeted and I do not believe they should be broadly available across our country. I also do not believe that, for example, they should be operating without maps or that the maps should be massively expanded. What I do not want to see happen is the owner-occupied residential relief being used as some kind of scheme that would facilitate, for example, extensions or upgrades of existing homes. That is not the intention of this. The intention of this is that it is used in a targeted way. The best way I have of delivering that targeted policy objective, which is about delivering new homes and trying to do that in the best way possible, is through maintaining maps and extending it in a targeted way to five more cities in a way that is consistent with the national planning framework."

There may be a time when that can happen. Of course, this will be open to review, I have no doubt, on a very frequent basis.",
                "When it was originally put forward that the scheme would be open to developers, I was maybe not as concerne as most because my experience of this scheme, understanding how it works and understanding some of its deficiencies, was that individuals who wanted to take on a property in certain parts of Dublin, for example, found it very difficult themselves to resource that renovation project because of the nature of the renovation works. My own area of Drogheda has dozens of architectural conservation areas so buildings can be tricky to renovate, such as old Georgian homes and so on that are vacant, and we do need to be mindful of that. It is often the case that only small-scale local developers have the resources and know-how to be able to turn around some of these properties and ensure that they do provide high-standard accommodation. We are often dealing here with tricky buildings. They may have been derelict or vacant for some time but may be architecturally important and preserved structures, so we need to be careful about how we proceed on that basis. There is also a degree of protection in terms of the two-year period for undertakings and the €300,000 cap, which would, I hope, mean that this would not in any way be open to any form of abuse, for want of a better term, by undertakings because the whole objective is to turn around buildings and make urban centres liveable and viable 24-7 communities where people live."

Dublin and Limerick are examples of where the kind of development that local authorities will allow to happen on properties is quite limited because they want to preserve the architectural heritage of the buildings. That is the reason that, after consideration, I did decide that there could indeed be a role for developers in relation to it, and if somebody acquires a building that is currently vacant and this scheme plays a role, ultimately leading to a new home being built, then I think that is appropriate."

I believe it should only be seven years is if the Minister feels they would not have a tax liability and would not be able to benefit from seven years. There is a cap of €300,000, however. Obviously, it is not €300,000 of a tax reduction and a person must apply his or her personal tax rate against it and then over seven years. That is the maximum. For somebody doing €50,000 worth of work to a piece of property to bring it to a liveable point, the tax benefit to that individual, paying a 40% tax rate, would be €20,000 and that benefit would be spread over seven years. Why not have an enhanced capital allowance for those individuals as well?",

What protections are there to make sure that does not happen because the Minister has got rid of the timeframe completely?"

That would be my judgment on it. However, I can see the point the Deputy is making and I will certainly keep it in mind because the last thing we are looking to do here is to fund a conversion that somebody is already planning to deliver. We do not want to see that happen. That risk is there but I think it is worth seeing what the broader benefit of this could be regarding all those properties across the different cities, including the five additional cities that will be included within this scheme, that have a retail presence on the ground floor and have floors above them which could be used for a home but which are not being used. I do not think this scheme is all of the answer to it but I think it is going to be part of it.",

There is not a huge expenditure on it but this is a big expansion in terms of the relevant properties and it does allow developers into it even though there are limitations. What are the policy objectives and financial safeguards that are in place in relation to the reform and expansion of the scheme, particularly with the reference in terms of developers?

I have made the case to the Deputy that given the nature of planning regulation in many of these cities, it will be the case that we need to broaden the scheme to allow developers to play a role within it. I will make a few points on the safeguards that are there in relation to it. Conscious of the experience we have had in the past with schemes like this, it is very limited geographically. The number of properties that may be able to apply and that would be able to qualify for it is 41,000, which is a relatively small share of the total number of properties we have within our State and, critically, it has a cap of €300,000. I believe they are reasonable safeguards to have in place."

                "Let me refer to one of the things that strikes me as strange about the corporation tax exemption. My view is that the LDA should never have been paying corporation tax. It made no sense. AHBs and local authorities do not pay it, and it adds considerably to the rental charge on the cost-rental tenant. The LDA has been campaigning on this for a while. When the new measure was introduced, my view was that it was positive, but then I started wondering whether the real intention behind it is actually to incentivise increased private-sector investment into the sector, in the following way. In the Minister’s Department’s report on the future funding of the LDA, completed in February and published in the summer, one of the recommendations suggested by his officials was that, to resolve the problem of the absence of a medium- to long-term funding option for the LDA, the LDA should sell properties off. Given the fact that it is buying most of its properties from private developers, through Project Tosaigh, it is an odd proposal, but that is one of the proposals that exist. The difficulty is that the LDA currently makes a commercial return, as required, of under 3%, in line with the capitalisation from ISIF. Private sector investors are not going to be interested in a commercial return of 3%. We know from our market analysis that they typically look for 5%. Therefore, is the intention not actually to address the viability issues, because the STAR scheme does that to some extent, but rather to create a scenario where a current, reluctant private sector investor might now be more attracted because the return they will get is higher? The reason I ask is because there is already a crisis in cost rental. The rents are too high and huge numbers of people applying for cost-rental cannot gain access to it because of the affordability tests. The very people for whom cost rental is designed are being turned away because the rents are too high. If we then move to a situation where private sector investors become major players, rents will continue to increase even further. Has there been any discussion of that as part of the rationale? Is this in any way connected to the recommendation from the report on the future funding of the LDA of the Minister’s own officials?"

Also, given that this measure does not really knock an awful lot off the viability challenge – the STAR scheme is really the vehicle to do that – would it not have made more sense to have initiated this change as an affordability measure? This was the point that Deputy Doherty was raising earlier. It would have a very significant impact on affordability and therefore would increase access to cost rental among those who cannot access social housing or private-rental or private-purchase accommodation.

The viability challenge is the gap between the price the market is willing to pay for something and the all-in cost of development, including the margin for whoever is producing the unit. The issue of the charging of corporation tax does not feature in the costings of a developer, whether that is the Land Development Agency or somebody the LDA is buying the units from. The corporation tax is actually borne by the tenant in the rent setting. A couple of years ago, the LDA gave some testimony to our committee and talked about its rent settings. It said at that stage that the average monthly rent was €1,400. It has a standard 40%, which covers costs, management and maintenance and for which there is no corporation tax liability. That means that the tax liability of approximately €210 a month would be on the rent, not on the costs of the development. I am interested in how, in the Minister's understanding of this measure, he thinks this will assist viability, given that it is not part of the calculations of the all-in development costs and, therefore, not part of the gap between the purchase price and the development costs."

The presentation we received - the case the LDA made to us - was presented in such a way that tax is included in the cost.

The LDA will have given the Department information that it may not have shared with us, but it would be helpful if the Minister could enlighten us as to how that reduction, which works out, on average, at €2,520 per unit per year, makes the unit more viable.

If we go back to the average cost from last year or the year before that – although it may be slightly out of date – the corporation tax liability on the average unit of €1,400 a month would be €2,520 a year. If we multiply that by 18,000, we would get a cost of €45 million, not €20 million. I understand from the Minister's conversation with Deputy Doherty that he suggested part of the difference may be that some would be LDA and some would be private sector. The rent setting is going to be pretty similar between the LDA and the private sector and therefore the cost of the tax exemption should be similar. If I am wrong, I am happy to accept that, but I am interested in hearing the Minister explain how he gets the figure on which he is basing the €20 million, because it is less than half of what the current corporation tax liability would be on an average LDA unit."

The aim of bringing this measure forward is, in a relatively moderate way, to try to make a contribution to the Land Development Agency to allow it to deliver more cost rental in the future. For that reason, the matter of it being a rent reduction that should be passed on to existing tenants is not one I considered with the Minister for housing. In any event, in the engagement that we had with the Minister for housing and his officials in the run-up to this particular decision, the case was made clear to us that the starting rent is set in year 1. It is set in a way that reflects the policy environment of the time and then it creates a legal contract that will be in place for a 40-year period, with a clear understanding of how it would be reviewed, which I gather is in line with consumer inflation. What I am saying to the Deputy is that I did not develop this measure with a view to it being a measure about reducing cost rents. I am not trying to be pedantic with him; I am just trying to explain my line of thinking. For that reason, I did not raise with the Minister for housing that this is a measure that should reduce rent downwards for existing tenants in the cost-rental scheme. It was also made clear to us, for the legal reasons that I have outlined to Deputy Ó Broin, that rent is set in a way at the start of the contract that would not allow such an intervention."

                "This is obviously a substantial change to our offering here, and follows on from last year's Finance Bill where the research and development tax credit was increased to 30% from 25%. This sees an increase to 35%. Could the Minister outline the costs associated with this measure? That would be the first thing.",
                "The second issue here is that, as the Minister knows, this credit mainly goes to larger companies. Many of them are within the scope of pillar 2. If the Minister has the detail on that – I think he provided it to the finance committee before – that would be helpful. I have serious concerns about bringing in such a measure in the absence of the review of R&D.",
                "I understand the Department has done the review and has not published it. There has not been a review on the research and development tax credit for a number of years. The Minister is asking Members of this Oireachtas to increase the tax break to 35% without any benefit of the review that followed the consultation. First and foremost, that is bad practice. There is a suggestion that the review may be published before the Finance Bill is enacted but it should be published now so that we can inform discussion, debate and dialogue as to whether this is an appropriate move in the context of what is happening globally, which there could be a strong argument for.",
                "I would like to have seen that review. I would like to have seen the concentration. I would like to have seen measures that would encourage the uptake by small and medium-sized enterprises of this tax credit. Approximately one fifth of it goes to small and medium-sized enterprises. Such enterprises make up by far the largest number of enterprises that exist in the State but only a fraction of the tax credit goes in that regard. Of the 1,600 or so claimants, I understand a significant amount of the value of this credit goes to companies with significant turnover in the State. That is not to say that we should not be supporting research and development in those companies. The question is whether in a period of 24 months we should go from 25% to 35% in relation to the credit.",
                "I would also like to see whether the review has looked at other ways that the research and development tax credit can be structured. There are research and development tax systems in other jurisdictions that target SMEs with more favourable provisions. I have argued that for probably the last decade with the Minister in relation to that issue because encouraging research and development is the engine to enterprise and the levels of uptake by SMEs are far too low. The Singapore scheme allows companies to claim a deduction of up to 400% on the first $400,000 of qualifying research and development expenditure. Australia offers SMEs a rate of 43%. The Netherlands is offering 40%. Germany has introduced an SME credit at 35%. There are different jurisdictions taking an approach to say that they need to see SMEs doing more and, therefore, they will provide an enhanced system to SMEs.",
                "What we have here is a blanket increase of 35% so it benefits everybody who avails of this. In 2023, there were over 1,800 companies availing of it. The price tag for this is €1.4 billion. It is by far the largest corporation tax relief in Ireland, and for good reason, but it has increased substantially over the last couple of years. In 2023, it was €1.4 billion. Two years before that, it was half that. I do not know what it will be in 2025, obviously, because we have increased the rate, which I supported, and what it could be in 2027 and 2028 when we see returns when the rate goes up further. These increases were happening without rates increases and as I said, SMEs are only claiming 20% of the cost, with 80% going to larger firms.",
                "I am reluctant to support this measure in the absence of the review that has been conducted and I do not understand why that has not been published. Maybe the Minister could answer. Has he seen the review? Is it completed? Is it on the Minister's desk? What is the delay in publishing it?"

He had that worry as a Minister for many of the businesses that he is meeting of where will they be in five or ten years' time although they may be getting by now. It is harder for small businesses to engage in the kind of research and development that this tax credit specifically supports and that is a challenge for them. Is this being looked at? Is it being considered?",

When will we see the review and can the Minister give us some insight into that?"

                "First, with regard to cost, the estimated first-year cost of the Finance Bill 2025 enhancement to the research and development tax credit is €169.9 million. The estimated Exchequer cost of the enhancement is €305.9 million. The difference in the first-year cost and the full-year cost is due to the manner in which a company claims the research and development tax credit in three instalments over three years. In year one, the first instalment of a claim is equal to 50% of the total claim other than for smaller claims in the scope of the first-year payment threshold. In year two, the second instalment is equal to 30%. In year three, the final instalment is 20%. Therefore, the full-year cost does not crystalise in year one, as claimant companies do not receive the full value of their tax credit until the third instalment in year three. For the third year, it would be expected that the first, second and third instalment amounts which are payable would all be in respect of the research and development tax credit claims at the 35% rate and, therefore, the projected full-year cost would be the relevant estimate.",
                "In terms of take-up and the point that the three Deputies have made regarding small and medium-sized companies and their ability to access this, we have over three different Finance Bills made a number of changes to the operation of this credit and I will talk in a moment about the impact that we are now seeing regarding the drawdown of the credit.",
                "The measures in previous finance legislation removed certain caps on payable credit and the process of first offsetting the credit against corporation tax liabilities and provided instead a fixed three-year payment schedule. They also provided that the first €25,000 claim would be payable in full in the first year instead of being spread over three annual payments. The policy rationale behind that was to try to provide a cash-flow benefit for smaller research and development projects to encourage more companies to engage with the research and development corporation tax credit regime. Those changes were made. They will benefit anyone to whom they apply and applies to the scheme. The change with regard to the €25,000 claim was made in the hope that it would be of help to companies of a certain scale.",
                "What is interesting is that the figures we have available for the most recent year, 2023, and the breakdown of the number and size of the different companies which are availing of the tax credit show that the value of the credit small and medium-sized companies are drawing down has increased. The total value of the tax credit companies with fewer than ten employees, namely microcompanies, are obtaining is €46 million. That is an increase of 24% on where we were in 2020. The value of the credits companies with between 11 and 49 employees are obtaining now stands at €95 million, which is a 69% increase on where we were in 2020. The value of the credits companies with between 50 and 249 employees have obtained has gone up by 51%. Thus, there are some signs that the various changes we made have been successful in encouraging more smaller companies to claim this credit and increase the value of the research and development they are involved in, which, in turn, allows them to gain a higher share of the research and development tax credit, as I have just outlined.",
                "I have not yet received the review, but I believe I will in a few weeks' time. The reason is that my officials who are involved in this area and their colleagues are also involved in work relating to the OECD and the ongoing international tax negotiations. I have asked that that work be prioritised, and it has received their focus. My aim is to be in a position, in a few short months, to publish the review of the research and development tax credit in conjunction with the compass document, which will outline the kinds of issues we will consider regarding the implementation of the research and development tax credit in the years ahead.",
                "Deputy Cian O'Callaghan referred to other ways in which we can support research and innovation in the economy a moment ago. This is the reason the Minister, Deputy Lawless, is taking legislation through the Oireachtas to allow the surplus in the National Training Fund, NTF, to be accessed and spent. My anticipation is that this surplus will be spent in a way that is supportive of research and development in universities. I take the Deputy's point that research and development cannot only happen in the private sector. We have to look at how we can support it in the public sector too, and the change in the NTF aims to make a difference to that.",

He may well have information on that. Regardless, my expectation is still that it will be the larger companies that are inside the scope of pillar 2 that will also be the biggest users of the research and development tax credit. If the Deputy has looked at the information the committee is aware of regarding the statistics the Revenue Commissioners provide on the scale of companies that use the research and development tax credit, he will know it is companies with more than 250 people working for them that are the largest participants in the research and development tax credit regime."

I have not seen the review and I do not have access to the Minister's officials to learn what they think, why they are not targeting the recommendation on small and medium enterprises or what is the most up-to-date information about who will benefit from this €300 million tax package.",

I am not saying this choice is wrong. I have not seen the review. However, I know from the Minister's predecessor that when the increase from 25% to 30% was dealt with at this committee - the Minister was not here because he had a different departmental brief at the time - the cost was €150 million, and the cost for the in-scope companies was €137 million.",

If that is the case, we need to be discussing that and we need to ask if it is appropriate that we are about to vote on a tax break that costs €309 million and it is likely that 91% of that, which is nearly all of it, €270 million, will go to companies that already have turnovers in excess of €750 million. That is a fair question. We then have to make a judgement. That is the latest information we have. The review would provide us with the most up-to-date information. We do not have a review. Is that statistic still relevant? The Minister talked about the departmental breakdown or the Revenue table - I do not have it in front of me - but from memory it gives it in different scales, and it is 50 employees and then the larger companies are 250. My understanding is all companies from 50 employees up are in scope. They are companies that have turnovers of €750 million or more. That was the information that was also provided to us by the Minister's predecessor on the record of the previous finance committee."

That can particularly benefit small and medium-sized enterprises and companies that do not just have capacity issues necessarily with the complexity of the tax regimes. It can also just be issues of scale in launching their own R and D. Supporting it in the public system can be particularly beneficial to them. There can be multiple companies or enterprises doing collaborations or benefiting from what is done in a publicly accessible way. However, there is a bigger issue here, which is a structural issue, where we have a large amount of the R and D tax credit has been used and taken up by large companies that are well resourced in terms of their ability and capacities to engage and R and D. We would have to ask, how much of that tax credit is dead weight and how much of it is encouraging new and additional activity? That is one part of it.",
                "We also have the structural issue in our economy of being weaker with R and D. We are a weaker country in R and D compared with our peers. For example, Ireland spends less than the EU average on research and development. The gross budget allocation for research and development per capita in Ireland is €198 whereas the European Union average is €274. We are one of the lowest countries in the European Union in comparison with our peer countries in terms of per capita spend on research and development. How that is spent is very much skewed towards the larger and some very large companies. We are out of kilter with our peers. There is a particular weakness and vulnerability here.",
                "When we talk about budgetary issues and finance issues, we often talk about the risks we have in terms of over-reliance on corporation tax from a small number of multinational companies, and indeed a high amount of income tax coming in from highly paid workers in those companies and our exposure there. In broader terms regarding our economic development and productivity in our economy, we have a particular weakness and vulnerability in having that big gap in what is happening in research and development. That could leave us in a crisis situation. That would leave us very much exposed if we did have a worst-case scenario and we had a pulling back from some of those key contributors in terms of corporation tax. That would affect us. We need to be building up our economy, productivity and enterprise on multiple levels, including small and medium enterprises.",
                "While I welcome the Minister recognising there is a role for universities and some funding is going to be going towards that from the surplus in the National Training Fund, I am concerned that we do not have a full analysis here and this is a significant measure. We cannot see the full analysis to know if this is the best use of resources or would it be better off using resources by targeting it more at the public system. While the surplus in the National Training Fund is welcome, it is relatively small compared with what we are talking about here. In any event, that is not what is in the Finance Bill that is in front of us. We are looking at these figures in the Finance Bill and my concern is that none of the pot that is available here is going towards the public system."

We have made reference to the €1.14 billion that is going through the Department of further and higher education. That is a lower figure than the €1.4 billion. That is the last known figure for the value of the R and D tax credit. The decisions that the Minister, Deputy Lawless, is going to make on the allocation of the National Training Fund surplus are big decisions. He will be allocating a lot of funding in the coming years in regard to that. I cannot recall what the exact figure is for the surplus that is available within the National Training Fund at the moment, but it is in excess of €1 billion over a number of years. He will be making a decision on the allocation of considerable resources. Through the Finance Act 2019, we provided for an increase, from 5% to 15%, to the R and D outsourcing limit on expenditure to universities or institutes of higher and further education.",

I am aware of the figures that Deputy O'Callaghan referred to, noting that the amount of money we invest in research and development in public terms as a share of our national income is not what it should be and does not always compare well with our peers. I also want to tell the committee that in 2022, the last year for which we have figures available to us, there were 10.9 researchers for every 10,000 people in employment. That figure compares to 9.7 for the EU 27 and 9.9 for the OECD average. There is investment going on but I accept we need to grow the investments we have in research through our universities and not just for commercial purposes, as research and innovation has an intrinsic good the taxpayer should be supporting, although that commercial benefit is real."

My concern is that because that logic is so strong, there has not been enough emphasis over the years on the other areas that need focus in terms of research and development. I welcome that the Minister acknowledges that there needs to be more focus in those areas as well. It is really important in terms of our long-term economic development. As the Minister said, it is not all just about commercial benefit either, there are other benefits as well. This is an area that has been neglected so if there has been a change of course and mindset, it is very welcome."

This is certainly not the entire solution to the housing crisis.

Was 41% chosen because it was the personal tax rate at the time? It does not really matter why it was chosen. It has gone down to 38%. The Minister indicated that this is a step, and that it will go down to 33%. Perhaps he can clarify that in his response with regard to the funds proposal.",
                "There were a number of other proposals, including the deemed disposal issue, which many people thought the Minister was going to deal with now. Has he signalled that he is dealing with that issue? Obviously, if people are investing today, they want to know whether that issue will apply in eight years or not. I have made the point to the Minister in the past that there is an important issue in terms of deemed disposal, which is that there should be no hoarding of wealth within these structures that does not get tapped into in a way that means the benefits that accrue from all of that are exempted from taxation. However, that has to be balanced with the position of individuals who are looking to save, given that, in some cases, the returns are far better but it is riskier than with a traditional bank. Is the Minister looking at getting rid of the deemed disposal rule - the eight-year rule – altogether, or is he looking at a threshold idea, where up to a certain amount would not fall under the deemed disposal rule? I would like the Minister to clarify his intention, or maybe he does not have a set position at this point in time. What is the position in this regard?",
                "On a broader issue, if we were having this discussion a number of years ago, the people this section would have been applicable to would have been few and far between. It is different now, when there are young lads out there buying shares on Revolut. In the past, they would have had to go to a broker but it is now happening on their phones, and they are buying a share for a fiver or buying into ETFs and all of that. I have always praised Revenue in relation to the efficiency of that section in every Finance Bill I have ever dealt with. However, if we look at the taxation information regarding ETFs, it is very hard to follow. There is no single taxation law for ETFs themselves, and it is obviously part of the greater fund issue, but it also depends on whether the ETF is located in Ireland, the European Union or outside of that, if it is Irish-domiciled, and all of that. Many people go on their phone and use Revolut, Trade Republic and all of these different apps. In most cases, they do not have a clue where the ETF is located or domiciled in the first instance. Even if they were to look at the Revenue guidance, I would argue that its guidance is more for professionals because it is very technical and there does not seem to be a simple analysis of what is required.",
                "One of the cases I dealt with recently involved somebody who had read on one of these threads that when they purchased an ETF or a stock - it does not matter how they purchased it, but they purchased it on Trade Republic or a similar app - they had to declare it to Revenue.",
                "My understanding is that was the case. It may not be the case now but I cannot find the information anywhere and I am used to going on to the Revenue website and being able to look at the guidance on that. We will have to look at this because these funds are now far more widely available and people are doing this with their Revolut accounts, etc. As far as I understand it, since around 2024 the requirement to include this in a person's self-assessment form is no longer there unless it is an offshore fund. Again, how you find that out is also problematic. I just wanted to raise that point in terms of the simplification of this given the fact that this is now widespread even though it might be at a small level but people are buying into investments on their mobile phones."

                "On the different matters that have been raised, I agree with what Deputy Doherty has said. The prominence of these matters is now so much so much higher than they used to be. I was really struck in the Second Stage debate by the number of Deputies from many parties who raised these kind of issues and I had not heard that happen before. It is happening because technology is now making it easier and easier to be involved in the sale of shares and different kinds of financial instruments. It is definitely the case among younger investors and because of this they are now doing it more. While I think at the moment it is still a relatively small amount of activity, it is going to grow as technology makes this easier and easier to do, and if even a portion of, though it has not quite happened yet in Europe and definitely has not happened in Ireland, the scale of retail investment that is happening in America, which is technology-enabled and which is now not just happening in the equity markets but in the whole new world where it is no longer new, that is, the exponentially fast-growing world of bitcoin, crypto assets, etc, comes over to Europe, it will fundamentally change people's participation in investment. I noticed this not just on Second Stage in the Dáil but in the frequency with which these kind of issues are brought up with me generally in Leinster House during different debates and committee appearances.",
                "I will deal with the different issues the two Deputies have raised. The first was deemed disposal. To be very clear, I am not giving any indication as to what will be dealt with in next year's finance Bill. That would be inappropriate to do. Anybody who makes investment decisions should do so on the basis of what the law is today and the tax is today. I am always extremely careful to avoid giving any indication at all in relation to any individual decision that could be made in a finance Bill 12 months from now. What I have generally said is that these kind of issues, and how we make retail investment easier for people to understand the tax consequences of, are something that I do expect to feature more in the finance Bills and budgets of the future. The one area that is not really about the revenue or level of tax per se in relation to it, has become extremely complex. Depending on what kind of investment decision people are making, how they are making it, where the asset that they are buying or buying a share of is located, there are now very many different tax regimes at play here. What we are going to do in the next few months is bring forward a piece of policy work indicating how we are considering these issues and changes that we are going to consider making from a simplification point of view because a growing number of people are participating in it and we need to make tax law, and the implementation of that law, clearer than it is at the moment. That is why in relation to the deemed disposal decision and its consideration in the context of this year's Finance Bill, the cost of doing that according to the figures available to me is €142 million. We believe it is possible that figure could be higher because of various consequences of making the decision. I have to account for that within the particular year of the budget as well.",
                "This is definitely an issue that will get more and more policy attention. This used to be the kind of world in which only professional investors were involved. We now have professional investors who are normal retail investors and there are more of them. This is, therefore, a matter we will have to return to. I also know and want to recognise the value of the funds sector here in Ireland. It has huge employers. They employ people all over the country, not just in Dublin. How we support the growth of that sector is also something that we considered in the context of the funds review that we brought forward around a year ago. We made some progress on a matter that was highlighted in that review in this year's budget."

It is unfair that people pay tax on something that they have not actually sold and made no gain. In fact, it probably forces these people to sell so that they can pay the tax, which discourages long-term investment and people investing for their future, pension or whatever. The idea of people having to pay tax when they have not actually sold anything is fundamentally unfair."

                "I hear where the Deputy is coming from but I have a different read on the matter. I was involved when the deemed disposal measure came in around 2012. The reason the measure was introduced, and it did not relate to retail investors at that time, is there was a hoarding of wealth within these trusts and they were never taxed. That is the reality. People passed on and they never drew down. That was the issue but a valid point I have made, and I think Deputy Timmins made the same point, is that there are levels here.",

He said that he is not giving any indication of what he plans to do, although he has said in the past in the Dáil that the reason it is not included in the Finance Bill this year is because of the cost issue and it is something that he is continuing to work on However, the deemed disposal rule should remain in place in a certain way but it should not prevent moderate retail investors from investing in this way. There are different examples of how different jurisdictions deal with and support investment at different levels. One of the most generous regimes is probably up the road in the North, and in Britain in terms of an individual savings account or ISA, where it is allowed. There is no deemed disposal rule and no tax but there are thresholds, which could be argued to be quite high. The Government was talking about reducing them but did not do that.",
                "On measures that have been brought in, the Minister needs to be careful. In some cases we are taking about multimillion euro that is sitting there and never being taxed, and the deemed disposal rule is about tapping into that, whereas somebody else may be talking about a couple of thousand euro and trying to build up savings through that mechanism.",

It not just the fact eight or nine different platforms are available and many people are using them, there is also the social media element. TikTok is driving much of this stuff for young people and we are seeing just that. We are also probably in an environment where there is a kind of bull run as well in this regard. People are seeing all of that and thinking it is always going to be rainbows and sunshine, which it is not going to be.",

There is no clear simplified guidance. I ask that we get that simplified guidance on this that is available to the high street. Revenue is very good at giving the three different documents that are available on its website for different funds, depending on where they are located, but we need something that is a more Q and A style geared at people who are clicking on their Revolut or Trade Republic app or whatever it is."

Reverse anti-hybrid rules were introduced in the Finance Act 2021 as part of the transposition of the second anti-tax avoidance directive, ATAD. The purpose of anti-hybrid rules is to prevent arrangements that exploit differences in the tax treatment of an instrument or entity under the tax laws of two or more territories to generate tax advantage. The reverse hybrid rule contains a mandatory exemption for collective investment vehicles, CIVs, that are widely held, diversified and subject to regulation, but the specific definitions to be used for these terms were left to the discretion of member states.",

Second, it provides for the look through of holding companies in an investment structure for the purpose of determining whether an ILP's investments are sufficiently diversified. The ILP must own directly or indirectly at least 95% of the intermediate holding company and the holding company must be resident in the State, another EU or EEA member state or treaty partner jurisdiction and must not be generally exempt from tax.",
                "These amendments will update the assessment of diversification to reflect industry practice and ensure that where an ILP uses holding companies in its investing structure, regard will be had to the full pool of investments in assessing whether the fund is sufficiently diversified."

To define advanced level, it means they are substantially using artificial intelligence, data analytics or sophisticated cloud computing. Further to that, the ESRI has noted that just 39% of Irish SMEs are currently investing in digital transition in any way. That is a concerning gap and one that is only going to grow as technology, such as AI, automation and data-driven systems become more prevalent and more integral to competitiveness.",

It is seeking to encourage an assessment of what new measures can be brought in to accelerate the digital transition. For example, one option would be accelerated capital allowances, allowing companies to write-off 100% of qualifying expenditure in year one rather than over eight years. That is done in a number of other areas, and that can be applied to AI, cybersecurity, digital infrastructure and even staff upskilling.",

We discussed that earlier but it could be extended beyond areas of pure research and applied to areas that might involve adopting and integrating new technologies would improve business models and processes. The Future Forty report published yesterday stressed the need to increase productivity within the economy. An obvious way to do this would be by supporting investments in the likes of AI, cloud systems, cybersecurity, etc.",

We also know some of the costs involved in this for smaller and medium-sized businesses can sometimes be very challenging.",

We have accelerated capital allowances, for example, with regard to energy-efficient equipment, though I know that relates more to the green transition than to the digital transition. Most important, the R and D tax credit is available, which we discussed earlier. That credit is the part of our tax code that makes the biggest difference to research and innovation within companies. We will bring forward the R and D compass, which will look at the direction of the R and D tax credit in the future and the role it can play in research and innovation within businesses.",

He is referring to how technologies can change the way companies operate, what they sell, how they sell, how they are structured and how people use technology. That is different from research and development. It is other things. That is something the local enterprise offices try to support local businesses on. Over a number of years, different grants and vouchers were made available from LEOs to businesses to assist in the digital transition. That is the most effective way we can support the kind of change businesses need to make.",

At the budgetary oversight committee, we are constantly reminded by IFAC, ESRI and all the groups who come in to us about the need to broaden the tax base. The Commission on Taxation and Welfare made that point as well. Wealth tax is a good way of doing that. According to the Revenue Commissioners, there are 1,170 high net-worth individuals who are worth €20 million or more. A well-designed cáin rachmais with appropriate exemptions could be a very good revenue-raising measure.",

The issues Thomas Piketty has gone into great detail on regarding growing wealth inequality, which the Minister is very familiar with, need to be tackled, and a wealth tax is a way of doing that. Given the future forty report raised the challenges we face in future years with climate adaptation and an ageing population, we need measures to broaden the tax take and tax base. Often when we talk about taxation, the focus is on income tax measures but people at income tax level are under huge pressures from the cost of living. We need to look at tapping into different sources to broaden the tax base. From an equity and social justice point of view, a wealth tax merits serious consideration, so I ask that this amendment be agreed to."

                "As he will be aware, wealth can be taxed in a variety of ways, many of which are already applied here in Ireland. These include capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax. These are, in effect, taxes on wealth, in that they are paid by an individual or company on the disposal of an asset or the acquisition of an asset through gift or inheritance. There is also deposit interest retention tax, which is currently charged at 33%, with limited exemptions, on interest earned on deposit accounts, and, of course, local property tax, which is a tax based on the market value of residential properties. Another is stamp duty, which is charged on the transfer of shares, stocks and marketable securities of Irish registered companies, as well as on the purchase of property, both residential and non-residential. It follows that any revenue raised from a wealth tax, no matter what form it takes, may not be additional to the existing forms of wealth taxation, as revenue from those taxes could be affected by the introduction of a wealth tax.",
                "In examining the topic, the Commission on Taxation and Welfare, which reported in 2022, identified challenges that would impede the implementation of such a tax. It concluded that a new tax on net wealth should not be introduced without first attempting to substantially amend our existing taxes on capital and wealth. As an alternative, the commission posited that a more productive route would be to re-examine CGT and CAT. The rationale for this approach is that there are existing taxes on wealth that have well-established, but distinct, bases and are well understood in their operation.",
                "A 2024 report by the Parliamentary Budget Office entitled An Overview of Taxes on Wealth in Ireland found that household net wealth had reached record levels - valued at €1,112 billion in 2024, up from €466 billion in recent years - and has outpaced price and wage inflation over the past decade; and that the revenue yield from taxes on wealth is relatively small.",
                "The report also notes that housing wealth is the most significant component of household wealth in Ireland. The report suggests that changes to wealth taxes or the introduction of a new wealth tax should be considered, and notes that a specific wealth tax risks an increased concentration of overall tax receipts on a relatively small proportion of taxpayers. Instead, base-broadening measures are proposed by the PBO to increase the number of taxpayers and revenue sources.",
                "We continue to take action against inequality through our tax and welfare systems. We have one of the most progressive systems of taxes and social transfers of any EU or OECD country. We already debated the progressivity of our tax code when it comes to income tax and USC earlier.",
                "I am aware that my officials currently are exploring the prospect of updating the joint research previously carried out by my Department and the ESRI in 2016, which examined the potential impacts of a household wealth tax. If proceeded with, and to provide a comprehensive analysis, this work will take time and it is not certain to be completed within six months from the passing of this Bill. For those reasons, I do not propose to accept this amendment."

                "I thank the Minister for his response. There are a number of things I want to respond to. Consideration of the introduction of a wealth tax certainly should not be done as an isolated measure. It should be done as part of our need to broaden the tax base. It makes sense in that respect. I am not arguing for this in terms of any sort of narrowing of the tax base or as a measure in absolute isolation. In terms of support for broad measures to broaden the tax base, there is good credibility in that area.",
                "I hope we will not be in a crisis economic situation any time too soon but the time to do things to broaden out the tax base is not in a crisis situation. The hardest time to broaden out the tax base is in a crisis situation. That is often when it happens because there is a necessity around it but really, we need to be doing this in the more stable times when there are fewer potential impacts, side effects and all the rest. What we actually need to do in terms of responsibility for the economy and our tax take is to be taking those measures consistently in more stable times so that when we hit a crisis, a lot of the measures we need are already in place. I make that point to the Minister.",
                "The issue of growing wealth inequality, both in Ireland and globally, does need to be tackled. A growing concentration of wealth is not good in economic terms. Thomas Piketty has gone into that matter in considerable detail. I am certainly not making the case that there is no taxation on wealth, but taxation on wealth that is mainly concentrated on transactions is a very particular form of tacking wealth. A lot of wealth does not necessarily go through transactions and can escape taxation there. Transactions are not necessarily a bad thing either. Transactions can be a good thing in an economy. Effectively, for large wealth holders, if they are mainly only getting caught for taxation through transactions, that is not necessarily the best place for the entire emphasis to be so I think broadening of that makes sense."

We are probably one of the few countries in the world where people who describe themselves as being on the left decided they would set their face against local property taxes. We know that the bulk of wealth, or at least a very significant proportion of it, is held in property and land. That is a particularly Irish phenomenon and is in evidence in the UK as well. There is a strong argument to be made for progressive local property taxes, and maybe generating more from that in time and giving people the opportunity to have less of a tax wedge - I do not like to use the word \"burden\" - on their income. That is an argument for another day.",

I would argue and I think Deputy O'Callaghan would as well that there is more we ought to be doing now in terms of taking a countercyclical approach given the challenges we have to our tax base, such as our disproportionate reliance on foreign direct investment, the revenue that arises from corporation tax and the risks that are posed to our income tax base. There is also the progressivity of our income tax base and the reliance on good jobs and therefore the income taxes from that.",

That is under way now. I assume, as the Minister said the research will not be available in six months' time, that it may be available in time for the next budget. I hope it is in good time for the next budget to maybe inform the Minister's own consideration of taxation and other measures that will be considered ahead of budget 2027. In the context of wealth taxes, I ask the Minister to look closely at what our socialist colleague in Spain, Pedro Sánchez, managed to do. He introduced a discrete net wealth tax that seems to work. It seems to point in a certain direction of a wealth tax that would work where there are, by necessity, some exemptions but not too many in terms of the family home, related business, land and so on. It seems to work in that it has not prompted what we might describe as a flight of wealth from Spain. It is complied with. It works with the minimum amount of grumbling, which is a good thing, and it is something we might take a closer look at. I look forward to seeing the outcome of the ESRI work. Will the Minister indicate when he expects that work might be made available, if not in six months' time, so we can scrutinise it and maybe consider it ahead of budget 2027, which seems like a long way away but is not?"

The current difficulty in the French Parliament in agreeing on the wealth is quite instructive, where they did consider it but have decided not to do it.

I am aware other jurisdictions have considered bringing in wealth taxes and have not done so.",

Everybody is in favour of broadening the tax base generally but I find that support begins to wither when we get into individual measures for widening the tax base. In fairness to the Social Democrats and the Labour Party, both supported the revaluation of the local property tax and support the principle of the local property tax. That is a good example of broadening the tax base but we have revalued it twice since it was brought in. You can debate that maybe the revaluation could have been more ambitious. Some would argue that it was too ambitious but two revaluations have happened and there are plenty of other property taxation systems near here that are still based on the value of properties in the 1990s where no revaluations have happened. They have happened here on two separate occasions.",
                "I agree with what Deputy O'Callaghan has said that tax base broadening at a time of crisis is the wrong time to do it but as he knows, huge expansions of the tax base in a single budget, even in normal times, produce difficulties. I do not underestimate the value, which again has been opposed in the House, of what we have done in relation to carbon taxation. That is broadening the tax base. It has gone up every year for the last number of years. As for the additional revenue that it is going to bring in for us, the base before I started increasing it is an additional €600 million per year. After a number of other moves, it will be a significant amount of additional tax revenue and we have had all the debates in relation to that.",
                "On PRSI change, it changed in October. It is going to change again in the next few years and will keep on changing. That is another example of broadening the tax base. The fact that it is happening in an incremental way should not diminish or distract us from the fact that those moderate changes are happening every year and every year, they will mount up to a wider broadening of the tax base than we sometimes acknowledge in these debates here.",
                "I was going to put a question to Deputy O'Callaghan but it was pre-empted by the answer he gave. When we get into these debates, I want to pose the following question. What exactly is the form of wealth that people think we are not taxing at the moment? If it is a share, it is taxed. If it is a saving, it is taxed. If it is the value of your home, it is taxed. If it is the disposal of an asset, it is taxed. If it is an investment saving, we just had a debate earlier on about a deemed disposal rule. That is a form of taxation as well. What the Deputy clarified there is that the area being considered is that we move into the taxation of wealth that is not based on the transaction. It is actually based on the level of wealth that is there. I would simply say to the Deputy that there would be policy difficulties involved in doing that. My own view is that it would just lead to the movement of capital and wealth out of what is a very open economy. What we have instead is a number of different taxes that aim to tax wealth in different ways, depending on the nature of that wealth. Most of that, with the exception of LPT, is done through transactions. I think that is a better balance for dealing with it. I know this is always going to be an issue of debate. We will try to do something in this area in advance of budget 2027 that will provide further evidence to inform the debate. I thank Deputy O'Callaghan for tabling his amendment."

                "When looking at wealth, particularly in terms of net wealth, the Government parties have ensured that many people who have bought their homes at this point in time are paying an arm and a leg - half a million euro and more - for houses now. In parts of this city, the average cost of a home is now €600,000. As people are mortgaged to the hilt, to say that them having a home is now a form of net wealth is nonsense. There are other areas where wealth can be tackled - and we will deal with it in the Finance Bill - such as pensions, inheritance and different assets. The Minister has mentioned that different types of wealth taxes apply to different transactions. Let us deal in reality. We are not naive here. In one part of the Finance Bill we are dealing with today, an income earner can get a €105,000 of a tax reduction. A developer can build apartments and make €2.5 million profit and yet not pay a penny in tax. Big investors here can have a rent roll in the hundreds of millions and pay no tax. There are loads of exemptions in the tax code that have been stitched in over many years that allow people to reduce their tax liability to very low levels. That is why there needs to be a careful, measured view of the taxation of wealth. Of course we live in a global society and wealth is mobile and all the rest but there is a need for fairness. However, I will defend to the hilt the idea that property should not be taxed, for example, for people on very low income. Incidentally, Jeremy Corbyn argued for that in Britain. He argued that the rates system should be abolished and a property tax should be introduced but actually the lowest levels of homes would be exempt from it. While property of course will be a part of it, there must be caveats to make sure the Government does not tax what is not net wealth in the first instance and to recognise that the family home should not be turned into a financial asset. This is the commodification of housing, which is at the very core of what has happened here in terms of a disastrous housing crisis that has allowed for a crisis to develop, not as a natural disaster or as a result of some unseen consequences, but as a result of policies by this committee. This committee deals with Finance Bills, expenditure and budgets. It takes decisions year after year that have resulted in one of the most disastrous things this State has seen and that is the housing crisis. That is on your backs folks. You have created this housing crisis."

There is a good model there in Spain, which has quite an effective working wealth tax, and we should look at that. The Minister referenced other countries where wealth taxes have been introduced that have not been well designed and have not been successful. That is the case so the core issue is that this be a well-designed tax that would not cause the kind of issues that have arisen in some countries where those taxes have then been abandoned. We want a well-designed tax that beds in and creates that revenue stream but also deals with those equity issues."

I do not believe Deputy Doherty can credibly say he wants to widen the tax base and, at the same time, be in favour of the abolition of the local property tax. It is not credible. I do not believe the stance taken by Deputy Doherty is a credible one. I do not think he can argue that he wants to widen the tax base and abolish the local property tax at the same time. The local property tax is a way to widen our tax base so we are taxing more than income. I know there are many difficulties regarding paying the local property tax for households, particularly households that are in financial difficulty or have low incomes, but if we want to widen the tax base, the obvious step is to introduce a well-designed, simple and clear local property tax, which we have in Ireland, that year by year will bring in additional money, the majority of which plays a role in the delivery of local services.",

That is a perfectly credible policy difference we have and can continue to debate."

The high cost of developing apartments is creating a viability gap, preventing their construction in the numbers required to meet the Government’s housing targets. Section 40 introduces a new section 81E to the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to provide for an enhanced deduction for eligible apartment construction costs to help address these viability challenges and to accelerate development activity. This measure will provide a deduction against profits or gains of a trading property development company of 125% of certain construction costs, subject to a cap of €50,000 per apartment, delivering a net cost saving of up to €6,250 per apartment. The enhanced deduction will be available in respect of a qualifying apartment block consisting of ten or more apartments and is available for both new-build developments and the conversion of non-residential buildings into a qualifying apartment block.",
                "Eligible expenditure includes the construction costs associated with developing apartments. Other costs such as professional fees, finance costs and levies are excluded from qualifying for the enhanced deduction. The enhanced deduction will be available in respect of qualifying completed developments where a first commencement notice was submitted to the relevant local authority between 8 October 2025 and 31 December 2030. The enhanced deduction is claimable by the beneficial owner of the completed development in the period when the certificate of compliance on completion is lodged with the relevant local authority and is to be claimed as part of the corporation tax return for that period.",
                "I am now bringing forward amendments to the draft legislation to provide for the use of forward-funding models, which have become increasingly prevalent in the apartment construction sector. The amendment provides for situations where a beneficial owner of the completed development cannot meet the requirements of the rules, as initially drafted, as it does not carry out a \"relevant property development trade\". This could include, for example, where an approved housing body, AHB, enters into a forward-funding contract with the developer, which involves taking ownership of the land from the beginning of the project and entering into a construction contract. Therefore, I am bringing forward an amendment to the legislation to provide that in circumstances where the relevant beneficial owner cannot qualify for the relief, it may make a declaration in writing to the company they have contracted to carry on the development activities to allow that company claim the enhanced deduction.",
                "To qualify for the enhanced deduction, the relevant contractor must be a company that carries out a trade that consists wholly or mainly of the construction or refurbishment of buildings or structures. The relevant contractor must retain the declaration and provide it to Revenue if requested to do so. The declaration must include the details of the relevant beneficial owner as well as details of the completed development. This amendment will ensure that the new enhanced deduction operates as intended by helping to address the viability gap in apartment construction."

We began this discussion on 7 October, which was budget day, and we met with the Disability Federation of Ireland, the National Disability Authority and Voice of Vision Impairment. We are delighted to have the DPO Network with us today for the second session on AI and disability. In attendance on behalf of the DPO Network we have: Ms Elaine Grehan, advocacy manager with the Irish Deaf Society; Dr. Michael Seifu, policy officer with Independent Living Movement Ireland; and Mr. John Sherwin, CEO of the Irish Deaf Society and secretary of the DPO Network. I thank the witnesses and welcome them here. I invite Ms Grehan, as the advocacy manager on the behalf of the Irish Deaf Society, to deliver the opening statement on behalf of the DPO Network."

The DPO Network organisations are As I Am, Ireland's national autism advocacy organisation, Disabled Women Ireland, DWI, Independent Living Movement Ireland, ILMI, the Irish Deaf Society, IDS, and the National Platform of Self Advocates. We understand that AI-powered assistive technology can provide supports for us inside and outside the home, such as access to information, the Internet, home controls and so on. Disabled people are using AI to help with composing letters or documents that they need, such as using large language models like ChatGPT to help with information to bring to medical professionals. However, we are concerned about the growth of AI and its unknown applications. We are concerned that there is little transparency on how AI is working and how it will be controlled for human benefit or for profit.",
                "Disabled people and deaf people must have a role in shaping how AI is developed now and into the future. AI is not neutral. Disabled people fear that AI will reflect existing institutional and structural barriers and attitudes, including biases relating to gender, ethnicity and impairment, unless there is clear transparency to ensure that structural biases are not built into these systems. A recent study in the UK by the London School of Economics care policy and evaluation centre reports that large language models, LLMs, used by over half of England's local authorities to support social workers may be introducing gender bias into care decisions. For example, Google's widely used AI model, Gemma, downplays women's physical and mental issues in comparison with men's when used to generate and summarise case notes.",
                "AI is impacting on jobs. This is a serious concern, given the levels of unemployment among disabled people in Ireland, recently reported as the worst in the EU, at 20% below the EU average. Disabled people need support around AI and digital literacy. We need to ensure equality of access for all disabled people and to ensure there is no digital divide. There are huge concerns about the carbon footprint and energy demands of AI systems. AI contributes to climate change, and climate change will likely have a disproportionate impact on the lives of disabled people.",
                "Deaf people have specific concerns about AI related to sign language, and the Irish Deaf Society has submitted a separate paper on this topic. The development of AI and sign languages must be grounded in rights, inclusion and respect. The Irish Deaf Society calls for national- and EU-level frameworks that recognise deaf people's linguistic autonomy, promote meaningful participation and ensure technology is rooted in respect. Deaf people must be central in the design, development and deployment of sign language AI technologies.",
                "We are aware that State agencies are likely to look to deploy AI for data-driven decisions. Disabled people, through our DPOs, need to inform that decisions made relating to AI bring potential risks around the autonomy and choice of disabled people. Under the public sector duty, when AI contracts are awarded, we need to ensure equality and human rights standards are applied. We need transparency around the deployment of AI with a clear role for DPOs. State agencies need to build in informed consent, the right to opt out and transparency in how and what information is going to be used. We are afraid that AI and technology will be seen as cost-effective replacements for human supports such as personal assistance services. We fear that decisions requiring human analysis or instinct will be made by an AI that cannot manage the nuances of life. We need to control and direct AI to meet our needs and not have AI direct and control our lives. We have provided more information in the documentation submitted to the committee."

Where we can contribute is on the lived experience of our members. Next week, we will launch the second position paper from the DPO Network, a blueprint for co-creation, in the audiovisual room here. This is a buzzword the committee will, hopefully, hear more about.",
                "It is involved in the human rights for disabled people strategy that has been launched recently by the Department of Children, Disability and Equality. Co-creation is where disabled people are at the table discussing the development of strategies and services. They are involved in an appropriate way in terms of the implementation of strategies and the monitoring of them. They cannot be involved in everything throughout every process. We are looking for our Government partners to find appropriate ways where we are at the table and discussing with them, beyond what is traditionally called consultancy, where a Government Department or State body might ask for feedback from disabled people at the start of the development of a process and, the next thing you know, the service is being launched, typically with problems because we have not been involved in the design of the service. Typically, we are not involved in the assessment of the service. This is where problems lie. We propose there is time and budget saving by involving disabled people in the services that are for them from the start and throughout that. We will send copies of the blueprint for co-creation, which will be launched next week, to all the Oireachtas committees, Senators and TDs. We hope that will provide a good blueprint for how we should be involved in all processes, including the development of the Government's approach to AI. We have also submitted the Irish Deaf Society's paper, but what we are trying to do is outline our concerns. However, a key priority for us is to be at the table when there are rules being developed about procurement of AI, protection of people’s identities and how it will be assessed. It is clear in the AI bubble happening in the United States at the moment that there is a huge amount of hype and over specification of what AI is capable of. We can see in chatbots and other forms of assistance that disabled people engaging with Government services quickly hit a wall where the AI cannot help them any more. It does not have the nuance to understand how to help."

As we mentioned, Ireland has the worst record for disabled employment in Europe, which is a shameful thing and must be addressed. We are very concerned about the financial gap.

There is the availability of the tools but also the ability to use the tools.",

All of these questions are related, but certainly we need to be involved at product design and creation stage and not just at the testing stage."

To have chatbots, GhatGPT, Grok or whatever, where they are being used for advice is one thing, but when there is an AI-powered service that is going to determine care decisions, that needs a significantly higher level of testing.

They see some signing happening on screen and there is an assumption that it is correct, whether it is communicating clearly or not to deaf people, which others have no visibility of. There is a requirement for guardrails around that, but the countries that have developed a corpus would, of course, be in line for benefiting more quickly around AI-powered sign language resources."

It is very much a high level of awareness but not involved in product design in any way. We would assume that the same lack in other technological development is still going to continue in the development of AI. We are on an awareness-building programme with Government about co-creation and we are struggling in certain areas of Government to get into that space. Certainly with less guardrails or demand from corporates, there is not the incentive that there is for Government to look after minorities in the corporate sector. From a Government perspective, perhaps if there is funding, Government supports and enterprise development, there should be conditions around that and some of the conditions should include co-creation with disabled people and deaf people."

That all conveys information. When it comes to AI they do not have those features. That information is not being conveyed, especially when they are creating avatars. They have pixellated images. A lot of that information is not actually coming across. Sometimes it is completely impossible to identify that information from an avatar whereas you would understand a person signing that information to you. It is really just word for word. It is robotic rather than using the important parts of sign language, in which 70% of meaning is actually in body language and how you use your body, not just the sign. It is more focusing on words for signs, rather than the all-encompassing use of sign language, expression and body movement.",

If we look at the national human rights strategy for disabled people, it referred to better access to digital and assistive technologies and the National Disability Authority also spoke a bit more about AI supporting independent living through universal designs. To delve into that positive piece a little bit more, how do the DPO Network and the Irish Deaf Society see AI improving accessibility? I was thinking about the example of airports when we hear an announcement and maybe an avatar comes on the screen, and it will not be perfect.

Of course, there is a place for Lámh as a medically generated communication tool that has some basis in Irish Sign Language but there can be confusion in the community.

That is my argument. I am conscious of the work of Adam Munder, who has done a lot of work as a deaf man around how technology can be used to help people who are deaf and who are hard of hearing. There is work being done at UCD on being able to improve understanding of Irish Sign Language. On Ms Grehan's point, as the technology is going to be there, our obligation as legislators and policymakers is to ensure it is used in the best interests of citizens and that we put the guardrails in place.",

Those who have been at meetings of this committee previously will have heard this already but I must read it into the record. Witnesses giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee. This means that, as witnesses, they have a full defence in any defamation action for anything said at the committee meeting. However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and may be directed by me to cease giving evidence on an issue.",

They are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that as is reasonable, no adverse commentary should be made against an identifiable third person or entity. Witnesses who are to give evidence from a location outside the parliamentary precincts - and I do not believe this situation arises today - will be asked to note they may not benefit from the same level of immunity from legal proceedings as witnesses giving evidence from within the parliamentary precincts and may consider it appropriate to take legal advice on this matter. Privilege against defamation does not apply to the publication by the witnesses outside of the proceedings held by the committee of any matters arising from proceedings.",

Therefore, a member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting. I ask any member partaking via Microsoft Teams to confirm, prior to making their contribution, confirm verbally that they are on the grounds of Leinster House. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.

                "Cathaoirleach and members of the committee, thank you for the invitation to speak today about innovation and development within Ireland’s aquaculture sector. Aquaculture is a vital part of Ireland’s blue economy. It sustains coastal and rural communities, supports local enterprise and contributes to our national reputation for producing safe, sustainable and high-quality seafood.",
                "In 2024, the industry produced almost 38,500 tonnes of farmed seafood worth €210 million, an increase of 8% on the previous year. It supported 1,835 direct jobs and contributed €73 million in gross value added to the Irish economy. These figures reflect both the strength of and the strain within the sector. Irish aquaculture operates in some of Europe’s cleanest waters and is underpinned by world-class environmental standards. However, it faces real challenges, including reliance on a few key export markets, rising input costs, raw material shortages, a complex licensing system, labour constraints and the pressures of climate and biodiversity change.",
                "BIM’s mission is to help the Irish seafood sector grow in value sustainably and across the whole supply chain. Our aquaculture work programme aligns fully with the National Strategic Plan for Sustainable Aquaculture Development 2030, in respect of which BIM is the lead agency on 32 of the 56 actions. Our approach centres on four interconnected themes, namely market-led growth, talent and capability, resilient and sustainable supply and innovation with cost-competitiveness. Together, these themes provide a joined-up framework to build a stronger, smarter and more sustainable aquaculture sector in Ireland. Our detailed work programme may be found on BIM’s website.",
                "Ireland’s aquaculture has earned a global reputation for quality and sustainability, but it must capture greater value and diversify its markets.",
                "Over 70% of our production is exported, mainly to France, the Netherlands and the UK, leaving producers exposed to market volatility. To address this, BIM, working with Bord Bia, is investing in branding, certification and storytelling that build consumer trust and highlight the provenance of Irish seafood. Programmes such as seafood certification, Taste the Atlantic and the seafood assurance pathway help producers access premium markets by meeting international standards and connecting aquaculture with tourism, gastronomy, and the wider Irish food brand. Our goal is to shift the conversation from commodity production to premium value creation, anchored in sustainability, traceability and local identity.",
                "A resilient sector depends on its people. Many Irish farms are family run, with an ageing workforce and limited formal training routes. Attracting new entrants and building modern management skills are essential. Through BIM’s human capacity development plan and the proposed national aquaculture apprenticeship, we are building clear career pathways into the industry. The aquaculture remote classroom, ARC, brings aquaculture into schools and communities, reaching over 6,000 students annually and sparking interest among the next generation. Upskilling initiatives for producers in areas like digital tools, business management and sustainability will strengthen the sector’s long-term capability and succession planning. The Irish Oyster Packers Group, initiated and co-ordinated by BIM, has harnessed synergies between oyster growers and has given rise to the formation of the Next Generation Oyster Farmers Group, which has been pivotal in adopting new technologies and market access for Irish-branded oysters.",
                "Sustainability and resilience are the foundations of Ireland’s aquaculture future. The sector faces growing biological and environmental pressures, including disease risk, seed shortages and the impacts of climate change. Our shellfish survey programme provides critical data on mussel and oyster stocks, seed settlement and husbandry practices to support more predictable and sustainable production. Our finfish challenge programme trials innovative technologies, including AI-driven fish welfare monitoring, hybrid energy systems and functional feeds that reduce antibiotic use. Complementary programmes on biodiversity, invasive species and freshwater quality are helping farmers adapt to a changing environment and reduce their carbon footprint. Through these initiatives, we are supporting Ireland’s leadership in sustainable seafood production and ensuring that the sector’s growth is environmentally responsible and scientifically grounded.",
                "Ireland will never compete on volume with global producers, but we can lead on innovation, efficiency and quality. High input costs and small farm scale demand smarter, technology-driven solutions. The aquaculture accelerator programme, supported by the Blue Revolution Fund and the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, is creating a €15 million investment platform for start-ups and SMEs developing aquatech solutions from precision feeding and automation to renewable energy and environmental monitoring. Our co-ordinated local management scheme, CLAMS, and special unified marking scheme, SUMS, initiatives continue to improve local co-ordination, safety and environmental management within aquaculture areas, strengthening the link between innovation and community. These programmes together position Ireland as an emerging European hub for aquaculture innovation through attracting investment, fostering collaboration and de-risking technology adoption for small producers.",
                "The future of Irish aquaculture depends on collaboration between producers, researchers, policymakers and communities. BIM’s work programme is not about working in isolation; it is about partnership, combining local knowledge with national strategy and global best practice. By investing in people, data and innovation, Ireland can build an aquaculture sector that is competitive, climate resilient and community rooted, one that delivers real economic opportunity while protecting the marine environment that sustains it."

                "In our opening statement, we cite a number of policy and guidance documents, including the strategic guidelines for sustainable EU aquaculture and the European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund, EMFAF, 2021-2027, the aims of which are to guide and fund a sustainable development of the sector while incorporating the European Green Deal. We refer to the aquaculture licence review 2017 and the National Strategic Plan for Sustainable Aquaculture Development 2030, which is the primary policy document for the Irish aquaculture sector because it sets out the Government's policy objectives and key actions to 2030. Our objectives in IFA aquaculture, working within this framework, are to increase output production volume, value and the number of jobs in the sector, hence creating jobs and enterprise in our coastal regions.",
                "We describe in our opening statement the importance that aquaculture has to some of our rural communities in creating jobs and enterprise, identity - in some instances - and, of course, the production of a valuable food commodity.",
                "We have quoted this financial worth to the Irish economy as being €211 million for a production tonnage of 38,500 of seafood. These figures are taken from the BIM report, entitled \"The Business of Seafood 2024: A Snapshot of Ireland's Seafood Sector\". We have also suggested that, in a matter of years, Irish aquaculture could contribute €500 million in direct farm gate income and a further €500 million in ancillary activity, for example, marine engineering, seafood processing and marine tourism, if expansion of the industry were allowed to happen. We believe coastal rural communities would benefit from this increase in scale of the industry. In saying that, we are acutely that the seas around us are a shared resource.",
                "Government policy proposed in 2016 that aquaculture production be increased from 45,000 tonnes to 81,500 tonnes per annum by 2024. I have quoted a figure of 38,500 tonnes as being the production output for 2024, so if one looks at the figures, it is clear to see that our production levels are stagnant or in decline. I accept that the target figures are notional but we are an island nation and we in IFA Aquaculture believe that these levels or targets achievable. To reconcile the gap in production outputs, we need to create a situation where confidence to invest in aquaculture is restored. We need improvements in infrastructural facilities on our piers, better amenities in our coastal communities to keep youth there and an improved social licence. In that, I include political and public acceptance of the industry because I do not hear a lot of that from day to day. I do not hear that kind of public support.",
                "Most of all, we need major legislative change to cut the waiting time for aquaculture licences. To this end, we all need to be more pragmatic and innovative. Waiting three to five years for an aquaculture licence in the case of shellfish or, as is the case with fish, 15 to 20 years will not make it happen. Investment will simply go elsewhere and our youth will go elsewhere. They already are. IFA Aquaculture still has the plans, aspirations and energy to make it happen but time is running out. We need to start taking things seriously if we are to build and maintain a critical mass in this industry to justify all the State inputs from all stakeholders involved, including BIM, the Marine Institute, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, the Department, processors and producers, who are still toiling away living in hope of a better day. I probably left out some stakeholders, but that is just a flavour of what is involved in the industry.",
                "I referenced the latest OECD report, which came out in February 2025 and states that aquaculture is a driver of seafood production across the world and that wild catch is projected to remain stable or decline slightly. That is the prediction of the OECD of a future world that needs more protein with a growing population while production in Ireland and the rest of Europe is stagnating. The administrative burden and the regulatory framework imposed by Europe for starters and, consequently, Ireland have to be more pragmatic and reasonable. To this end, we note that the European Commission plans to reduce the administrative burden for businesses by at least 25% by the end of its mandate. It started that process this year; I saw stuff about it in July. For us, that is encouraging. It is probably encouraging for many industries. We encourage the Irish Government to embrace this line of thinking. We are encouraged by comments from the Commissioner for Fisheries and Oceans, Mr. Costas Kadis, on his visit to Ireland earlier this year when he said that aquaculture had the potential to increase EU seafood production and contribute to food security as the fastest growing food production sector globally.",
                "It is now critical that a single piece of legislation be brought forward to implement and underpin appropriate aquaculture policy in this country and bring together all the existing primary, secondary and amended legislation into one single provision.",
                "This has been done in other member states and we now feel that the time is overdue to embark on this road in Ireland because we are getting over in it. We urge the Department to act on this to be ready to attract and encourage interested investors in the agriculture industry going forward. This will help to unlock the future potential of the industry for all the reasons I have already cited. Some of our immediate needs are because we are working within a framework now that we have to work within. We feel that there could be more pragmatism brought into the system as well. At the moment we feel that human resources is an issue around appropriate assessments and that it is a desktop exercise for the most part, so that people are needed to be able to do it. There are three people there now and prior to that, there was just one and I believe there are two being appointed but that kind of stuff should have been done previously."

Thankfully now we have a focus on fisheries and seafood every week but in a previous committee we only really had a focus on fisheries three or four times a year as part of the agriculture committee. Even within that we had a dedicated session or two, which were eye-opening in terms of aquaculture. I am pretty sure the statistics are still the same and it was that the Faroe Islands, which has a population not much larger than that of the Inishowen Peninsula, has a bigger aquaculture industry than Ireland. Iceland, with a population of around the same as Belfast city has a much bigger aquaculture industry than Ireland, as of course do Scotland and Norway. We are completely underperforming in terms of the potential of aquaculture. In fairness to anybody I have spoken to in the industry, they do not ever contest the right of somebody to object. If someone proposes to put in place an aquaculture operation of course people have the right to object but the issue is that a quick decision needs to be made. Whatever that decision is, make a decision and make it on a timely basis.",

I have put questions to the Marine Institute and the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board, ALAB, both of which have appeared before this committee, when new chairpersons were being appointed. In fairness to the new chairpersons, they were only getting read into their brief. I have asked them and I have asked the Minister if they have enough resources to make these assessments and make these decisions in a timely fashion. My request to the aquaculture sector is to talk more about the impact of the delay in licensing and the impact on the sector's ability to open new markets. I recall speaking to some representatives of the industry a few years ago and the Government was taking them out to Asia to try to build new markets. They asked how could they build new markets when they could not guarantee a pipeline because they did not know whether they were going to have a licence in the foreseeable future. For the committee members' benefit, please address the underperformance of the industry and the impact of the delays in making decisions on licensing."

On the one hand we are creating a fund to promote and grant aid projects in aquaculture but if a licence is in renewal, which is the case for many people for years, they are disqualified for grant aid from Europe. This is all because the licensing system is not working properly. It is a contradiction, in that money is available to help people develop business enterprise and on the other hand, because people do not have a licence through not fault of their own, they cannot avail of the funding. It is not of our doing. We have been waiting for years for licences.",

The two main issues that I see are that production is not there and there is no critical mass to supply and maintain continuity to markets, as Ms McManus would say, and, second, there is a sustainable aquaculture fund but one cannot benefit from it."

People ask why and one reason is that our costs in Ireland are so much higher, so the finfish sector decided to go under organic production rules. Automatically, that reduces the volume that can be produced in the licensed area. The licensed areas have not changed in 20 or 30 years. In our case, for example, we have halved our production to comply with organic farming rules. Ireland has gone down that route because we feel the organic profile suits the Irish image. It is a way of trying to get a higher margin on our product because we are competing against big producers elsewhere, in Norway, Scotland and even in the Faroes, where production costs are lower because of their economies of scale. The Irish industry has pivoted that way but that cannot go on forever. As we know, in the past five years, business costs - energy costs and input costs - have increased significantly for everybody due to various geopolitical events and so on. We need to be able to reach other markets that want this high-end, organic food product. Unless we can guarantee continuity of supply, we cannot do that, given our current production limitations at the moment. That is where we are stuck. In a way, time is running out for us because other producers elsewhere will probably take on the organic production model. That is where Ireland will lose out. This stagnation means we are losing."

If one is trying to build a market and one needs to show a pipeline, what would that look like in terms of increased regulation and monitoring? Speaking personally, I think we can build a much bigger aquaculture industry in Ireland while addressing the legitimate environmental concerns people have. I think we can do both. If we have a system in which decisions are made quicker, which is better resourced to make those decisions and is resourced for regulation and monitoring, I think we can achieve a balance.

They are covered under legislation, in that they can operate, which is fine, but there are concerns about things like the licence conditions being out of date, to a certain extent, as Ms McManus referred to, and in terms of the ability to produce at a level that is economic and using modern and innovative practices. Obviously, we have moved on in the last 30 years. That is one aspect. If someone is waiting 20 years for a ten-year licence to be renewed and the licence is out of date, that does not work. One of the things that can be acted on is to issue a 20-year licence term.",
                "That is actually provided for in our current legislation. To do that, however, we also need legislative changes to facilitate the monitoring and compliance that would need to go with a 20-year licence term. Therefore, it is not a case of issuing a 20-year licence term and people come back in 19 years when they need their renewal. That is not what we are saying. We are saying we need a proper monitoring compliance system alongside that 20-year licence term, which is really tied up in the renewal of the licence as well because in order to renew the licence, in the case of shellfish, people need an appropriate assessment carried out on a bay basis. That is carried out by the State. It is carried out by the Marine Institute. There are huge delays there in carrying out that work. It is very important work that needs to be done. In the case of a finfish licence, people need an environmental impact assessment along with many other types of assessment, such as an appropriate assessment and Natura impact statement. All that work needs to be done, and it is incredibly important that it is done and that is time-bound as well in that those investments have to be updated and renewed. However, we can build a licensing system that incorporates that so that maybe those assessments are done at a particular point several times, obviously, throughout that 20-year period.",
                "We also have lots of different monitoring and regulatory systems that are already in place around fish health, benthic ecology and food safety, which are already built into the system. However, maybe those pieces are not connected up as well as they could be in a system that would be robust in terms of monitoring and compliance that would satisfy, as the Deputy rightly pointed out, people who have concerns, which are valid, and address those concerns. We have a system that is probably a bit piecemeal at the moment. There are some parts of it working very well and that function very well, but a lot of it does not speak to other parts of the system, if that makes sense. A 20-year licence term is possible, therefore, but there is a bit of work that has to go in underneath to be able to sustain that."

I often say at this stage to the Department that our mussels will grow fine without any licence. There was no regulation really when we started way back in the 1980s. The amended Act came afterwards and the whole business had to be regulated, and it got regulated and everyone was compliant with that. However, what happens then in the vacuum of licences being issued is that we have people drifting towards non-compliance. We could find very quickly that the industry - there are roles in this industry, and we do not know either; I am only speculating - becomes unregulated to a degree, and that is not a good place to be for the industry or for the State.

Certainly, they are points we are deeply aware of. We speak to IFA Aquaculture and the Department to see how we can assist in any way possible to try to move this along. BIM's mandate is not as the licensing authority. We work very much on the edges of the licensing process, in that we map sites for people and help with their applications but we do not have any role in determining those licences. There is no doubt there is great opportunity in the sector if that matter can be resolved.",

As Mr. O'Sullivan said, access to grant aid is important and operators are not able to avail of it. We do a number of things. We focus very much on trying to optimise the sector that is there. We have 1,800 people working in the sector turning over €210 million, so there is a lot to work with. We focus, for example, on survivability. To take salmon for example, a 1% increase in survivability of salmon would generate an extra €6 million for the economy at the first point of sale. Any improvement we can make on survivability will have a direct impact on the viability and profitability of those businesses. We have projects such as our bubble curtain, for example, where we are trying to help improve the survivability of salmon.",

To come back to Deputy Mac Lochlainn's comment earlier on why we are not more like the Faroe Islands, we have a very different geographic situation to the Faroe Islands. They have very deep sheltered fjords while we do not. We have much more shallow coastlines that are very exposed to the Atlantic. What this means is that, in addition to the fact we are going to be limited in the capacity we can develop, we are also very exposed to storms, plankton blooms and jellyfish coming in. Therefore, survivability is key. We have had some catastrophic losses in recent years, with entire sites being wiped out in one storm.",

About 50% of the cost of running a farm is feed. I mentioned aquatech in my opening statement and anything we can do, working with some of these technology companies, to improve the cost-effectiveness of feed and lower those costs will again have a direct economic benefit to those farms. Additionally, we have been trialling hybrid wind systems on the barges that are servicing the site. Rather than running them off diesel, which is another significant cost, we have been looking at running them with wind turbines. We are looking at lots of different things we can do. We have trialled reverse osmosis to produce fresh water. We are looking at all the components of running those businesses to see how we can make them more economically viable, how to strengthen that return and how to improve the survivability of salmon. While I agree the licensing is without a shadow of a doubt a big challenge, there are lots of areas BIM continues to work on to develop the sector."

We have an aquaculture remote classroom that goes around the country and teaches children - mostly in coastal communities but not exclusively - about the impact of aquaculture, how positive it is for their communities, where the food comes from and the benefits for their local communities. It has been an overwhelming success. There are 500 schools on the waiting list for the vehicle. We have other programmes such as Taste the Atlantic where we work with 21 producers along the coast. This started off as a programme to build trust among the local community. It involved inviting members of the local community, visitors and tourists to see their farms, do a farm tour and go out on boats to understand how they were farming responsibly in a very sustainable way. They also had food offerings there. They are hugely successful for those businesses. In addition to building that trust, they are finding that it is also a very good revenue stream.",

Over the course of the past year, we have been developing a formal programme, which we will discuss with industry and all of the other stakeholders mentioned by Ms Morrissey earlier, to look at a systemic approach to how we can tackle this at a national level. It is not a question of BIM being able to do it on our own. We need to do it collaboratively. We have some very good initiatives that have been very positive but we believe that if we look at some of the models from other countries, and we have taken some of the learnings from international best practice, there are some very good models out there regarding how we can move this along at pace. That is a significant priority for us for 2026."

In terms of building trust with communities, we do not generally have an issue in the communities in which aquaculture operates. Mr. O'Sullivan mentioned Bantry. Obviously, people up the town would not know but, generally speaking, there does not tend to be an awful lot of opposition where it operates. Ms McManus would say the same about some of those sites that are operating up and down the coast. There is a wider public perception, and a misunderstanding mostly, as to what aquaculture is and what it is about. There is a job of work we also have to do in the industry to address that."

It employs 1,835 people directly and up to 8,500 indirectly, with a turnover of some €210 million. It should be much greater than that. That is not the fault of the investors. I believe it is the fault of the system. Be it five years or ten, it takes far too long to secure a licence.",
                "Mr. O'Sullivan mentioned, and I agree, that legislation needs to be put forward to implement and to underpin aquaculture by bringing together all of the existing legislation, be it primary, secondary or amended legislation. However big a job that is, it is not rocket science to be able to do that. We are trying to help people in the sector. We are here to learn of the pitfalls that can befall those who want to invest, because there is one advantage of aquaculture. The language of total allowable catches or quotas is not part of the language of people in the sector, and we must try to capitalise on this. Maybe I am wrong when I say this, but I think we learned a lot from Norway. In my own county, in the company Marine Harvest, the Norwegians were very involved and we have learned from them. We have the waters off our coast and the environment to attract investment. If we do anything as an outcome of this, let it be that we try to prevail upon the Minister. We are fortunate now that we have a designated Minister of State dealing with this because beforehand it was unclear whether it fell under agriculture, the marine or environment. We have to try to prevail upon him and the Government to do something to help. The delays are outlandish.",

Ms McManus made the point that planning applications normally take about seven or eight weeks and are either refused or accepted or further information is sought, which might delay it another six months. It was not the same but there is a good template at the moment. Previously, with An Bord Pleanála, applications could go on for years, whereas now the applications going to the new planning authority have to issue within a specified period. With new legislation, we have to insist that decisions should issue within a specified period, providing all the required information is supplied. If an application is made, it should not be accepted or validated until such time as all the information is there. That is not beyond the capabilities of those in the sector.",

We raised this issue with the local authorities when we met last time and we have a tabular statement of works that are going on. I believe is a matter for the local authority or for the Department to provide the required infrastructure. I did not attend, but I am familiar with what happened in Limerick and in Cork. The Commissioner, Costas Kadis, was very supportive of this when he was there, but there is no point in him going to Limerick or to Cork and making supportive statements. It is like playing golf, there has to be a follow-through after they hit the first ball. Our job now is to ensure that we try to pursue this vigorously on behalf of the witnesses. They have enough to do to run their businesses, to invest and to try to make them sustainable. Those not making a profit will not survive.",

Would we be in preference of a one-stop-shop? We absolutely would. We have too many shops that we have to stop at at the moment to try to get a license and we still cannot get one. A one-stop-shop is actually referenced in a document called the strategic guidelines for sustainable EU agriculture. It is a recommendation in there. There is also a staff working document from the European Commission around addressing the regulatory and administrative burden. It is referenced in there. In a way, it is referenced in our own licensing review looking at that legislation. The Deputy mentioned a single legislative measure that we really do need to see some movement on. Therefore, we would prefer a one-stop-shop so that at least we would have some certainty around the process because, as I mentioned earlier, part of the problem is that we have no certainty around the process from when we make an application, where it is at in the various stages along that application process, how long each stage is taking and what the expectation could be in terms of a timeline to have the license at the end of that process. If we knew that it would take two years to get a license, that would be a fine thing, but we have no idea. Greece is a very good example of a country or member state that has implemented a one-stop-shop and a single aquaculture Act, and that is working pretty well for it. Denmark has another similar system with a one-stop-shop and a single aquaculture Act as well.",

We met the implementation group. However, the strategic plan is over two years old and we have only met the implementation group once, and that was this year. We could call that progress but, again, it is slow.",
                "As the Deputy mentioned, ALAB is another process. People effectively start all over again in terms of how that process is dealt with. They may as well be starting from scratch in terms of how an appeal is dealt with in their applications. The process takes too long and we have no certainty around how long the process takes. It can take many years to get a decision from ALAB because it essentially has to redo a lot of the assessment work a second time around."

The idea of waiting ten, 15 or 20 years is an absolute scandal, and there is no other word for it. I cannot understand why this has been allowed to happen over many years.

I live only a couple of minutes away from Cromane, so I know first-hand what I am talking about and how important it is to have these licences for the young men and women in that community. As Deputy Gallagher said, it creates employment in coastal communities and villages where no other employment is available. It is great to see those who are successful in getting planning permission to build a house and living and rearing a family in the area, or being able to afford to buy a car or build a house. We need to get our act together. This is the biggest issue I have faced since I came into the House, and it was an issue long before that. We need to get it sorted."

There is the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Marine Institute, the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority all involved in this process and trying to just make a decision. Now, there was a finding of an invasive species. That is fine. There is a protocol to follow to make sure the process is followed correctly such that we address that concern about an invasive species.

We were delighted about that but, as Ms Morrissey said, two non-native species were found, both of which, unfortunately, were species of national concern. BIM's role then was to convene a meeting of the alien species working group. As Ms Morrissey said, there has been a tremendous amount of work done on that point, but it is a very important regulation in protecting all the other species growing in the bays, and we certainly cannot risk there being any issues with that. That risk assessment is done and, as Ms Morrissey said, we are just waiting for a determination on it."

                "Go raibh maith agat. All our members have had an opportunity to speak so I will take my opportunity now. I have a number of questions. The first set is for the witnesses from the IFA. As has been said, the issue around licensing is the biggest single barrier to innovation and development in the sector, a sector, as Deputy Mac Lochlainn rightly said, that could play a much more significant role than it already does in our coastal communities, national economy and seafood sector. I think the issue of licensing is holding back, as I said, development and innovation because it strikes me that if you are on a renewal licence for ten, 15 or 20-odd years, you are subject to those conditions and subject to the conditions that were maybe current 25 or 30 years ago. There is very little room for expansion. There is very little room to develop, differentiate or innovate. I think that is the biggest barrier. Then it is obviously a barrier to entry for new entrants into the sector. The Government has allowed this to happen over a very long period. It is becoming rarer. There is no external agency outside of the Department that this can be pinned on. It is within a Government Department that this problem has arisen. We have discussed it today and previously in public session. We have also referred to it in some of our private meetings. It is a piece of work we are going to launch into. This is a new committee, as the witnesses can appreciate, but this is very much on our radar. At the end of the day, the Minister and the Government have to be accountable for this failure because it is holding back development, hurting innovation and creating real hardship for a sector that should be taking off.",
                "As Mr. O'Sullivan mentioned, there is a growing population all around the world. There is a growing demand for protein. We have an ability here to produce quality protein in a very sustainable way. We need to tap into that. I have a number of questions in this regard.",
                "In our guests' experience, is there a difference between finfish and shellfish in terms of delays or the causes of those delays? When talking about the need for a single piece of legislation, are we referring to the new fisheries (aquaculture) (amendment) Bill, the heads of which are being prepared at present? Has there been any engagement with the Department? Has it come to the organisations represented here to solicit their views and consult, even informally, as it drafts the heads of that Bill? I understand they are currently in development. I do not mean to repeat the question, but surely there must be a bottleneck somewhere in the Department. There could be several bottlenecks. Is it around the Marine Institute coming forward with the assessments? Is it just a lack of staffing? Is there anything the witnesses can see from their experience? We will definitely hear from the Department and the Minister what the issues are from their point of view. As people representing applicants, I would like to get a sense from our guests of where the issues lie. I will come back with another couple of questions afterwards."

In the finfish sector, there are requirements which are not present in the shellfish sector. Those requirements are around our environmental obligations under the habitats and birds directive. Applicants for a marine finfish licence are required to do an environmental impact assessment. That has to be appropriately assessed by the Marine Institute and the applicant needs a Natura impact statement. The environmental impact assessment is a huge body of work. As Ms McManus will attest, it takes many years.",
                "On what we were lacking, Deputy Gallagher mentioned it in terms of engagement. A person applying for planning permission for a house would have engagement with the local authority or the Planning Authority in advance of sending in such a large application. That did not happen in the case of these licence applications. As a result, there were gaps in terms of what was required in environmental impact assessment, despite asking numerous times what would be required and what they would want to see in an environmental impact assessment for a marine finfish licence. We got no guidance from the regulatory body, which is the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. We have moved on from that. Those assessments have been done and submitted to the Department. They are in the process of being assessed by the Marine Institute, as the scientific advisers, and then they will undergo public and statutory consultation at the same time.",
                "In terms of addressing the bottleneck that the Cathaoirleach mentioned, yes, there is a bottleneck in terms of the Marine Institute carrying out appropriate assessments for both finfish and shellfish. For a shellfish application, there is no requirement to have an environmental impact assessment. However, appropriate assessments are carried out on a bay-wide basis for any licence that is either within or adjacent to an SAC or an SPA, which is actually the majority of our licences. While there is a bottleneck there, if it was addressed on its own, there would be another one down the line as there is a bit of over and back between Department and the Marine Institute in assessing what the latter has assessed, comments and things like that. There are bottlenecks throughout the whole system. Resources would address it, but they would have to be put in at every stage of the entire system.",
                "The Cathaoirleach asked about engagement with the Department on the draft heads of the Bill. We have had engagement with the Department over the past two years, I would say, regarding those draft heads. Our understanding is that they are only to address section 19A(4), which is a provision in our current legislation that allows us to be operational while awaiting licence renewal. We have the privilege of enjoying our current licence conditions while waiting for that process to be renewed. Thankfully we have that; we would not be able to operate without it as we are waiting 15 or 20 years for those licences to be renewed. My understanding is that the draft heads of the Bill are going to address just that and that they will also contain some amendments that are required to deal with ALAB."

We often talk about supports for the fishing industry in terms of the mackerel and wider pelagic species crisis around quota, and inshore fisheries and the challenges they are facing. The refrain we hear, which we understand and accept, is that fishers do not want supports, but to be able to fish. I am sure it is the same for those involved in aquaculture. They do not want supports. Rather, they want to be able to conduct their business well, create employment and turn a profit by producing quality protein. However, there has already been reference to storm damage from significant weather incidents and there will also be mass mortality incidents arising at different occasions. We have discussed one previously. Are there supports available? What further supports could be made available?",
                "Regarding the oyster industry, it has already been referenced how patient one must be, not just in terms of the licensing process, but in terms of the life cycle of several of these species. There is a three-year life cycle for an oyster and if there are mass mortality incidents over a number of years in a bay, it can wipe out an entire industry in that region. Are there supports available in those instances? Has there been any communication from the Department or the Minister regarding supports for the oyster industry in particular and the aquaculture industry more broadly?"

In the Cathaoirleach's own constituency, there has been significant oyster mortality over the last two years.",

This has been an issue for us. We have highlighted it several times under the European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund, EMFAF. We hope that, in future, there will be a mechanism to allow us to at least access some of those funds. As the Cathaoirleach noted, if an operator experiences recurring mortality several years in a row, that will not be sustainable. With regards to recurring mortality, we also have to address the causes of the problem, and we are trying to do that as well."

I spoke earlier about some of our innovations on the finfish side but we are also involved in a number of innovations within the oyster sector. One of the challenges the industry has is the fact that quite a significant amount of the oysters we grow in Ireland are small. They are called twos and threes. They are small-sized oysters for which the market has all but disappeared. What we do grow in Ireland and grow it more successfully than any other country in Europe are the large oysters called speciale oysters. These oysters are a beautiful teardrop shape with a very high meat content and there is an enormous - almost unlimited - market for them. What we have been doing is looking at the innovations we can bring to allow producers who cannot currently grow them to grow them. We have been working with industry on this. We have been on a few foreign trips with the industry to see various technologies and have identified three technologies that are very successful and that we can work with producers to put on their farms to grow these speciale oysters. This is a really important innovation we are doing, one that has been adopted by a number of our clients and operators and has allowed them to access markets for which there is very significant demand. These sorts of innovation we are doing are very important across the sector.",

We are looking in particular at companies that have traditionally serviced the fishing sector. If we look at Killybegs, for example, we have Cahir Engineering, which would have done a lot of engineering solutions; Swan-Net Gundry with nets; and Sea Quest, which does water pumps. We support them through our aquatech programme to service the growing global aquatech and aquaculture sector. For example, we brought 12 Irish companies to Aqua Nor in Norway in August with Enterprise Ireland. As a result of that engagement, the vast majority of them secured contracts to service the growing global aquatech sector. We are looking not only at innovating physically on the farms, but at how these companies can innovate to meet new market demands.",

It is very difficult to introduce a non-native species to the coast but where we can look at that opportunity is in the on-land system through circulating aquaculture systems. We are just about getting to the point where we feel some of these systems are starting to look like they could be commercially viable. There are a lot of systems that are in test globally. There are some in Norway, Denmark and further afield. They are looking at lots of different species such as salmon, turbot and shrimp. However, they are not yet at the point where they are commercially viable. The running costs are enormous and they have a critical point of failure if they were to lose power, so they are not quite commercially there, but it is likely that they will start to be viable over the next couple of years.",

I want to get a sense of the frustration felt by BIM. Some of the challenges have been outlined in terms of the topography and types of coastlines around Ireland. That is fair enough but Scotland also faces into the Atlantic Ocean and experiences exposure to strong waters, starfish, etc. My guess is that Iceland has similar challenges. Ms Bocquel referenced the Faroe Islands and I defer to her on that but there must be countries that have equal challenges to Ireland but that have done a lot better than us. How do we meet our targets in the future? How do we ensure we have an industry that people can invest in and one that has a sustainable future?

For the first time last year the production of aquaculture outpaced the seafood coming from wild capture fisheries, which are stable globally. Obviously in Ireland we have had particularly bad news for 2026 but certainly globally, they are broadly remaining stable. So there is enormous potential for Ireland there not only as aquaculture producers but there is also the ability to premiumise our product. I have spoken previously to the committee about the phenomenal capacity we now have within our processing sector. The vast majority of our processors are multispecies processors that are able to process a lot of different species, obviously including salmon but also shellfish. There is an enormous opportunity for them globally with the investment that the State has made in 2022 and into 2023 under the Brexit adjustment reserve, BAR, funds. We now have one of the most modern processing sectors in Europe and we are seeing enormous ambition with these companies that are able to access the global demand in a way they could not previously. What they have is consistency of supply and are now able to provide the products in the formats their clients require at the pace and speed which they need.",

We are growing a lot of food that we are processing here, we are exporting some and we are also importing it. There is huge opportunity with those global markets. France has been our number one export partner for the past number of years but we are working with Bord Bia to open new markets. For example, last year it opened a very strong market for us in Japan, and we are looking at other markets right across Asia but also in Europe. Europe is much easier for us to get to. We have very strong connections with Italy, for example, and we see lots of other opportunities there. Only 2% of the seafood that France imports is from Ireland, so, clearly, as a very close neighbour, there is very significant opportunity for us there. Again, it is a matter of working with Bord Bia to ensure we are really trying to capture some of those premium markets and add as much value as we possibly can to all the seafood we produce, whether we are catching and landing it, growing it in Ireland or importing it."

Around that time we saw a huge increase in costs on everything, really, when the invasion of Ukraine first occurred. The European Commission did allow for that provision. There was an implemented decision under the EMFAF to facilitate that but, despite numerous asks of the Government, we were not successful in securing any direct funds."

That is very unfair. Agriculture gets supports, as does everything else. There is no reason aquaculture should not get support. I have seen it myself in fish farms which might be farming for three years and then the fish die. They then go to fishmeal or are destroyed. That whole farm and the jobs are wiped out. It takes three years to build it back up again. There should be a support mechanism put in place if this does happen. Whether it is mussels or finfish or whatever, there should be something there because at the end of the day the employer and the people who own it can only carry it so long."

                "I thank the Senator for his support in those areas, because it is something that has never been addressed. We can suffer on if we have problems. Financially we try to keep going and get going again the next year. The title of this meeting is \"Aquaculture Innovation and Development\". We, or I, have not spoken about innovation as such. We have spoken about lack of development but this is just to say the industry has innovated down the years. It definitely is the case in the salmon industry where people now control their feeding from satellites so the fish get fed every day and are not hampered by bad weather. They can control the whole thing. I have seen a hub in Castletownbere where they have a wall full of monitors and they can see the fish above and below the water and can control the whole thing. The thing about aquaculture is that it is not confined to salmon or shellfish. There is a scheme involving multitrophic aquaculture, which is a combination of finfish, shellfish, algae and so on. It has the least environmental impact. It has good control over the water. There are opportunities there. The whole potential of algae and seaweeds has not been explored at all in this country. There is a lot of work being done in laboratories around extracting compounds that can be good for creating diabetic medicines and stuff like that. There is a lot that can go on there in a smaller scale. When I look at other countries such as Spain and Galicia, they are probably growing 300,000 tonnes of shellfish. We do not need to be on that scale. I am aware that our coastline is difficult, especially the west coast, but there is always some place for shelter. When we started out, the first five years we were wiped out because our gear was wrong. We developed better mooring systems and growing systems. We changed over to continuous rope and moved away from plastics. We reduced the plastic content of our mediums for growing shellfish by 90%. We use biodegradable cotton and reuse the rope. We are using the same continuous rope for over 20 years. We are conscious of not using up world resources and keeping away from plastics.",
                "For example, in the beginning if our floats were damaged they were dumped. That was 20 kg of plastic that was going somewhere for recycling. We now repair them. We learned how to weld them and stuff like that. We passed that information around the country to other producers. We are in a circular economy really. When we talk about aquaculture, we are not confining it to just shellfish or finfish. There are other opportunities there. It is happening in other countries. A couple of years ago I looked up videos of algae production for China. As far as the eye can see they are growing algae, which goes into the supermarkets and the video shows all the different products they have. We have the technology. We have the intelligence in this country and the education to develop those industries more and to micromanage them into medicines and pharmaceuticals. That is all I wanted to say because it might seem we have neglected innovation, but we are continuously innovating."

This may be a product of where aquaculture sits in Irish public life. Is it sea fisheries? Is it agriculture? Where does it fit in? There are probably myriad agencies the sector is left dealing with between inland fisheries, BIM, the Marine Institute, ALAB, which we mentioned, the EPA and many others including various Government Departments, albeit that there is now one with responsibility. What are the thoughts on that one-stop shop model for the other sides of the business, not just the licensing?"

                "Regarding the algae, I was talking to a producer yesterday in the car when I was coming up. I asked him how he was getting on as they are launching a couple of products soon. There is a marine research centre a few miles from me that is working with Teagasc on algae that can be introduced into the feed of cattle to reduce the methane. I was at a Teagasc meeting where it came up for discussion and there was a presentation. I said, \"I know the outfit that are doing that.\" The cattle were rejecting it a little bit at the beginning because it was just sprinkled on top, but they are incorporating it now into the pellets for feeding. They can reduce the methane by 80% in the cattle. Whether that is right, wrong, or true, they have to prove that. What I am saying is there are opportunities in lots of different directions that we are touching on and having a look at but not finishing and seeing where they are going. There is plenty of money going into research in universities that have the capacity to do this type of work. There is a lot of potential. Like a lot of research and development: you win some; you lose some, but I feel there is a lot. If there are seaweed lines in place, they are not that heavy so storms will not affect them as much. Whereas, in the case of mussel lines, there could be 25 tonnes or 30 tonnes on them. There is weight on them so the swell will affect them more. There might be 3 tonnes, 4 tonnes or 5 tonnes of seaweed flapping around the place growing and absorbing carbon, nitrogen and phosphates from the water. They are very good at that.",

In the past year, we appointed somebody who is working on this matter. It is a complex area, but on in which there is a lot of potential.

Sr. Stan championed social justice, advocated for the homeless and spent her entire life standing on the side of those in need. She gave gentle yet powerful voice to the voiceless. She never stopped working for a fair and equal society. She leaves an incredible legacy of compassion, activism and hope. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a hanam.",
                "The Government's energy task force published its interim report yesterday, confirming people's worst fears. Households will be hit with massive electricity bills this winter, with average yearly bills approaching €2,000. The barrage of electricity price hikes from big energy companies puts people under huge pressure in the run-up to Christmas.",
                "Three hundred thousand households are unable to pay their electricity bills. Household energy arrears have almost doubled in the last four years. Many more will now be pushed into this awful situation. The Government's decision to strip away energy credits was a terrible call in a terrible budget - a budget of €9.4 billion that has left working people worse off. That is some going.",
                "While people are so brazenly ripped off, what is the Government's big idea? It is a promise to make an announcement of a plan sometime next year, with action to follow God knows when, if at all. Households are being fleeced, right here and right now. These huge bills are already landing and yet the Government pretends like it is not happening.",
                "Government failure to tackle energy rip-offs leaves people in desperate situations, with families using prepay meters going days without electricity and households relying on organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to keep the lights on. The Government sits back and allows big energy companies to rip people off at every opportunity. Now, as the days get darker, families will be forced to cut back on necessary electricity use, counting the cost every time they use the washing machine and feeling pressure every time they flick on the light switch because they know it is costing them a fortune. Is that an acceptable way for people to live?",
                "The big question for me is this: how many wake-up calls does the Government need before it acts? Four energy companies announce big electricity price hikes but the Government does nothing. The International Energy Agency reports that energy companies are fleecing Irish households but the Government does nothing. The CSO releases figures proving that people are being ripped off but the Government still does nothing. Now the Government's own task force confirms that households will be hit with massive electricity bills over the coming weeks but the Government still does nothing. Worse still, the Government actually has the neck to tell people to wait until next year for some pie-in-the-sky plan. Not alone is this Government inaction woefully out of touch, it is downright lazy.",
                "This is a lazy do-nothing Government incapable of understanding how these huge bills impact on people's lives so it does not even muster up the effort to do anything about it. That is not good enough. The Government's job is to stand up to those companies, to end this energy rip-off and to support households mar tá geimhreadh lán de bhillí leictreachais ródhaor in ann do theaghlaigh. Caithfidh an Rialtas seasamh suas in aghaidh na comhlachtaí móra fuinnimh agus tacú le teaghlaigh. Given the scale of this crisis, will the Government now act to reinstate energy credits to help households and what action will the Government take to reign in energy companies and to put an end to the scandalous rip-off?"

                "The fuel allowance being increased by €5, and expanded for those in receipt of the working family payment, made it a targeted approach to those who are feeling the pressure of energy prices across our economy. As a result of another Government intervention, an additional 50,000 households will be eligible for fuel allowance, which will mean that 460,000 households, or 26% of all households, are now eligible for fuel allowance. We have made wider interventions in supporting children and families, including the increase in the child support payment, and there are other measures in the context of the Department of Social Protection. Next year, that Department will have an overall allocation of over €28 billion. On our overall broader spending across our economy, this Government made a €2 billion package in social protection in budget 2026 to respond to the pressure many households face and target it to those most in need. That is the context in which we set about trying to help to mitigate the impact of energy prices.",
                "The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has done extensive work as part of the national energy affordability task force. That has set out a number of recommendations in the context of the programme for Government, where we have set out changes in assessment of the overall regulatory model for energy prices in our economy. That is work he will undertake. In the national development plan, there is our continued investment in the warmer homes scheme, with hundreds of millions of euro to support families, and many other interventions to support low-income households.",
                "We made significant interventions in the budget as part of our social protection package, including the retention of the 9% VAT rate on gas and electricity. We made a decision not to continue one-off temporary payments because we have to be honest about managing the overall budgetary parameters and the need to manage expenditure policy out to the medium term. We want every decision we make to be sustainable, affordable and permanent. It is not sustainable to continue one-off payments over the existing allocations. That is why we made specific and targeted interventions in the context of our social protection package."

I have told him already, and he knows, that 300,000 households are already in arrears. I have told him that energy companies have hiked their prices upwards and upwards with no real substantive challenge from anyone in the Government. They can do what they want. I have told him that in the run-in to Christmas, families now - not next year but now, in November and December - cannot make it and the Government simply sings dumb. I find it astonishing that the Government is so out of touch. We need action now. We need the energy credits as an immediate response, but the Government needs to take on these energy companies and face them down."

I know my colleagues in Drogheda, Deputy Ged Nash and Councillors Michelle Hall and Pio Smith, are working to support all those affected. I pay tribute to the courage of the firefighters who saved lives on Friday night.",

Dozens of times in recent years, residents have faced attacks and violence in what are modern-day pogroms. In my own constituency, I work with volunteers who are dealing with knife attacks on men who are forced to sleep in tents due to the Government's failure to house them. The State must step in. The Government must now undertake an urgent security review of all centres where refugees or people seeking asylum are living. Completing this work in advance of the second anniversary of the Dublin riots would be an appropriate deadline.",
                "We also need a reflection on and a review of the language used and policies implemented by the Government. The conflation of immigration with criminality in rhetoric can contribute to an environment where violence can develop.

He implied that people facing deportation make up a significant proportion of Ireland’s inward migration. Of course, this is wrong. However, it was not a slip of the tongue. His Fine Gael colleagues have since repeated it, and the Minister's party leader, the Taoiseach, has backed him.",

These disgraceful attacks are not reflective of the views of the overwhelming majority of our people whose first instinct is one of compassion for those people being subjected to intimidation and of revulsion towards those carrying out these attacks. People across our country are proud that Ireland is a tolerant multicultural and diverse country. They recognise how reliant our economy, our public services and our communities are on the contribution of those from migrant backgrounds. I see it in my constituency, which is one of the most diverse constituencies in the country. I thank the many people who have come here for the enormous contribution they make to our economy, our communities and our society. We need to be clear on that in all of our discussions when it comes to migration.",

Everyone on this side of the House shares the Deputy's view that we should have a compassionate, caring approach to anyone who comes here and treat them with humanity and dignity. We should be clear that many of them come places where they would be vulnerable. In his remarks, the Tánaiste said migration is a good thing, but he was just making broader remarks on the system we have. We should be able to have a mature debate about the type of system we have. We are clear that it should be a rules-based system with enforcement. It is important that we have that in the context of managing a complex issue globally. That is why there is constant evaluation of the various factors that are contributing to overall migration into our country. The Minister, Deputy O’Callaghan, is being proactive across a number of measures he has introduced, while also sending a strong message on the contribution that many people who have come here make to our economy.",
                "On the Deputy’s question, there is a security review, and that is part of the wider work that goes on with any centre that becomes applicable under IPAS. To be clear, this Government shares the Deputy’s perspective on how we treat people, but it is important that we can also have a debate on how we can have a balanced approach that is fair and also manages the consequences for those who are not given status. There need to be consequences for those who are not given status. If they have appealed and are not allowed to stay, they need to be managed in the context of a functioning migration system. That is the broader context in which this debate should be had."

I certainly do not think the Tánaiste’s conflation of all migrants with a tiny number of people facing deportation orders was responsible. The Minister has acknowledged the reality that the vast majority of people who have migrated to Ireland are here to work and that our schools and hospitals are staffed by people who have come here to provide an essential service – people who are propping up our creaking healthcare, education and nursing-home systems. That is what we all know to be the case, so why is there a focus in Government rhetoric on scapegoating those who come here seeking asylum and somehow conflating them with the vast majority of migrants, who come by different means entirely?",

Mere days after rioting broke out in Citywest, Simon Harris suggested migration numbers, including the number of people here on work permits, were too high. Then, after the despicable arson attack on Friday night, the Government moved immediately to talk about charging those in direct provision for accommodation. You could not make it up. That is not to mention that a callous proposal to reduce accommodation entitlements for people from Ukraine to just 30 days has also just been signed off. Where is the emergency stand-alone meeting on safety concerns for people in international protection? Where is the emergency meeting about increasing levels of violent hate in our communities?

The Minister, Deputy O'Callaghan, is constantly doing that in his engagement with colleagues across the European Union to look at the wider incentives and disincentives and the push and pull factors. That is a normal part of migration policy across Europe. We should be able to have a separate, honest evaluation of that continuously so that we are able to manage the overall numbers that are coming into our country. That is not dismissing the need for migrants and their ongoing contribution to our economy, but we need to be able to have an honest debate about that.",

If this horrific event is not enough to prompt the Government to engage in some reflection, then I do not know what is. The Government now has a deliberate strategy of depicting international protection applicants as scammers gaming a lax system-----"

Meath is the biggest commuter county in the country. It is the only county in the country where the majority of workers leave the county to go to work every single day. Some 90,000 people in Meath commute to work on a daily basis and 60,000 of those are forced to use cars due to the lack of a rail line. Navan is the biggest town in the country without a rail line at the moment. In 1994, Fianna Fáil's Noel Dempsey promised to build a rail line between Navan and Dublin. The delivery date slipped and slipped. We were promised to have it in 2015 but it was never built.",

In 2021, it was promised to us again. We were told that the building of the rail line would start by 2030 and it would be built by 2036. This promise was met with derision in County Meath, to be honest. It is typical horizon politics - so far in the distance that it never gets done. In 2036, it will be 42 years since the rail line was first promised by Fianna Fáil.",

Studies have been done on congestion in European cities and Dublin is the worst in terms of time and cost. There have also been studies of the speed of traffic in Dublin at the moment.

Some €22 billion of the over €100 billion being invested in the next five years will be in transport, specifically to build more roads and ensure our public transport objectives are delivered. There is going to be a serious transformation of transport investment over the next five years.",

That is why over the coming weeks we will publish a series of actions, to be implemented in 2026, which will accelerate the delivery of infrastructure across our economy. It means rebalancing regulation in our economy and reassessing a lot of the rules, processes and structures that are not working and are delaying decision-making and adding cost, rather than value, to the cost of projects when they come to be delivered and procured. We will introduce reforms from a legislative perspective on critical infrastructure and on trying to advance that in a greater and quicker way.",
                "We will also be examining the roles of our regulators and ensuring there is a duty to co-operate across many of our regulators, which at the moment are a part of the sequencing of delays that undermine the delivery of infrastructure across our economy. I will, in the coming weeks, be able to show the difference that will make to the delivery of infrastructure.",

There was a reduction in capital expenditure when the economy contracted and that contributed to delays for many of the projects, which the Deputy referenced. That was a part of the previous national development plan. Part of what we are trying to do now is to match sectoral investment plans in transport and other areas with new short timelines so we can better deliver transport infrastructure. The Minister for Transport, Deputy O'Brien, is working with the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, on a sectoral investment plan for transport in our economy. That will seek to match this very serious allocation. Nearly €1 of every €4 we will spend on capital over the next five years will be spent on transport, which is one of the biggest investments in public transport and our road network for many years.",
                "Part of that is to try to match that with a credible pipeline of projects which we can deliver over a period of years while also trying to set out a new delivery mechanism into the early 2030s for projects that needs to go through planning and procurement. He will be able to set out further detail in terms of the transport sectoral investment plan. This new approach to infrastructural delivery is about rebalancing risk. The Deputy is often in here attacking public servants, politicians and others. People have a role in ensuring accountability where there is excessive spend on particular projects but it is also important we rebalance the risk appetite so that we address risk aversion in decision-making.

Those commuters have paid for those bridges over and over again and yet the Government is using this stick on those commuters by putting up that price again instead of using the carrot of providing the necessary public transport they want to be able to use. That is where the major frustration is. On one level, the Government cannot introduce and cannot develop infrastructure because the systems are grinding to a halt with bureaucracy and red tape-----"

It has led them to a cliff on the nitrates derogation and there will be nothing in place for them come January if that derogation is not retained."

There are no published reports of inspections of direct provision or EROC centres in County Louth, including this building, for 2025. The Government has paid millions of euro for asylum seeker accommodation to a company which is owned by a man who has been linked by the Criminal Assets Bureau to the Drogheda gang feud. Recent media reports suggest that the owner of this company, Secure Accommodation Management, has been paid €10.2 million since it was set up in September 2022. Indeed, the then Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth highlighted its huge profits for 2023.

                "A few weeks ago I stood here and highlighted the fact that whilst An Coimisiún Pleanála has much expertise in the realm of planning, it has no in-house expertise when it comes to aviation. I flagged that here in the Dáil and an upshot of that in the days that followed was we were notified that Sagentia, a British company, has been taken on as an independent consultant. Why is it that the Irish Aviation Authority, the taxpayer-funded State body for aviation safety on D'Olier Street, is being overlooked and undermined by An Coimisiún Pleanála? It is the authority for air safety in this country. I have asked An Coimisiún Pleanála this and await a response. I want to know what was the cost, due diligence and procurement process and whether there were any conflicts of interest. This needs to be laid bare because we have a State body. Why should we go outside the country and take on private contractors? Why would we overlook the HSE or any State body? Why would we overlook the Irish Aviation Authority when it raises red flags for aviation concern? Why would we go beyond our jurisdiction and pay a lot of good taxpayer money to bring in a private contractor?"

                "I thank Deputy Crowe. I am not familiar with the contribution he made a few weeks ago but what I would say is An Coimisiún Pleanála is independent in its functions and around its assessment and evaluation of planning considerations and decisions. I do not know the direct circumstances the Deputy has referenced, but there may be difficulty in taking someone out of the Irish Aviation Authority and bringing them into An Coimisiún Pleanála if it is doing an independent evaluation or assessment of a particular planning matter. The priority we have in the context of investing in public services is to support recruitment across our public service. That is reflected across our agencies, regulators and Departments in building expertise and that is reflected in the growth of public sector numbers in recent years. There may be a particular case where contracts have to be entered into if temporary expertise is required in a particular regulator or agency for a temporary period. I will ask the Minister, Deputy Browne, to assess what the Deputy has said, respecting the fact An Coimisún Pleanála has to operate independently and separately to all of us to uphold the integrity of the planning system."

Since I came into the Dáil in 2016, I have raised this issue monthly - the latest was two weeks ago. The answer I got a couple of weeks ago from the Minister was that a flood relief scheme would be delivered to Bantry in 2031. The people of Bantry have been destroyed by floods last night and for decades. The Southern Star carried a story last week which recalled that in 1983, people had to sit up in businesses in Bantry and put their feet up in the air as the businesses were surrounded by floods. The time for talking is over. The time for Ministers of State with responsibility for the OPW coming to Bantry time in and time out to talk to residents and businesses is over. All Bantry wants is a flood relief scheme, not promises of compensation packages that cannot be delivered. Bantry has had enough. Throughout these decades of flooding, Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael has been in government. Will they fast-track the flood relief scheme, deliver it in 2026 and not kick the can down the road as they have done for the past 50 years? Councillor Danny Collins told me this morning that there is great anger in Bantry and that there needs to be a meaningful compensation package for businesses and residents. Will that happen this week?"

                "I move: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"",
                "I am pleased to address the House on the Second Stage of the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Bill 2025. The Bill will provide the legal mechanism for the payment of €1.5 billion of equity investment in ESB, as committed to by the Government under the national development plan. I will set out the broader context for why Government equity investment is required, before outlining the subject matter of the Bill.",
                "As Deputies will be aware, Ireland’s electricity demand will grow significantly over the coming decade. It is estimated that electricity demand will double by 2035; this is in addition to the 25% growth that has taken place over the past ten years. The International Energy Agency has advised that expanding and modernising electricity grids is essential for a secure, affordable and sustainable electricity system. It has expressed concern that globally, investment in grids is failing to keep pace with spending on generation and electrification. In Ireland, every five years our electricity network companies, ESB Networks and EirGrid, present their five-year forecast investment plans to the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, which then approves the revenues allowable for their operating and investment programmes.",
                "These revenues are charges to electricity customers known as network tariffs. This process is known as a price review.",
                "The next price review, PR6, covers the period 2026-2030. The CRU published its draft determination for PR6 in July of this year. As part of the draft determination, an overall network expenditure programme of between €14.1 billion and €18.1 billion is being considered for the period 2026-2030. A final determination will be made by the CRU later this year.",
                "The level of investment being considered under PR6 marks a significant step change. The current price review, PR5, which spans the period 2021 to 2025, will see an investment of at least €7.6 billion. PR6 will more than double that.",
                "This unprecedented package of investment will enable the network companies to support Ireland through this period of change in terms of our use and demand for electricity. It will support key priorities in infrastructure, housing, competitiveness, investment, growth and climate action.",
                "It is a critical period for Ireland in terms of improving security of supply, realising targets and ambition around decarbonisation, expansion of renewables and development of the offshore grid.",
                "The benefits to extending and reinforcing the grid are many, including: improving the resilience of Ireland's electricity system and future-proofing it for generations to come; ensuring that every home and every business have a reliable and secure source of electricity, including the 300,000 new homes we have committed to build by 2030; safeguarding against damage from future weather events and storms; and accelerating the connection of new sources of renewable electricity which contributes to Ireland's transition to greater levels of renewable energy and achievement of our climate goals.",
                "The investment also has huge importance for our economy and will be key to ensuring that the State can increase the critical infrastructure it needs to ensure continued economic growth and employment in our economy, in addition to continued foreign direct investment. The investment will ensure we can support the expected 50% growth in electricity by 2035 and deliver on Ireland's energy needs.",
                "The scale of the increase, however, means that both companies need financial support to deliver the ambitious infrastructure investment programmes. In July of this year, as part of the national development plan, Government agreed the investment of up to €3.5 billion in additional equity to support the PR6 grid investment programmes over 2026-2030 and beyond. This represents the largest single investment ever made in Ireland's electricity network. Some €2 billion will be invested in EirGrid to support the financing of its offshore grid investment plans and €1.5 billion will be invested in ESB to support the financing of its onshore grid investment plan.",
                "In respect of the equity investment mechanism for EirGrid, it is to be noted that this will be agreed and legislated for separately. Investment by EirGrid in offshore grid will begin next year. However, the majority of its investment will not occur until later this decade. The €2 billion Government investment will be allocated over the next five years to support EirGrid access the capital markets and fund its investment.",
                "In terms of the investment in ESB, this Bill has been progressed as matter of priority. The equity investment in ESB is required by the end of this year to ensure payment from the Central Fund of Government approved NDP funding in the 2025 budget and to ensure ESB is sufficiently financed to deliver the ambitious onshore grid investment programme, continuing and expanding its existing investment in our grid. As such, the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, and I sought a pre-legislative scrutiny waiver from the Joint Committee on Climate, Environment and Energy. The waiver was granted following a technical briefing on the Bill being provided to the committee by officials from my Department.",
                "The €1.5 billion equity investment in ESB is to support ESB's ability to finance the overall investment plan for 2026-2030 as part of PR6. This overall investment plan will be financed by debt issuance on the bond market, supported by Government's equity investment and ESB Network's regulated income, as approved by the CRU. It will see delivery of over 500 capital projects across transmission and distribution networks. This includes 81 km of new overhead lines, 319 km of new underground cables, nearly 70 new and upgraded substations across the country and 50,000 pole replacements.",
                "ESB Networks will expand, modernise and reinforce our onshore electricity network infrastructure. Without Government equity investment, ESB would be unable to deliver such an extensive and rapid programme of work in the five years to 2030. The Government equity injection into ESB will support the strength of its balance sheet and ultimately assist in it maintaining excellent credit ratings.",
                "While the investment does not directly lower current customer electricity bills, maintaining strong credit ratings ensures that ESB can borrow at the most competitive interest rates which ultimately lowers the impact of network charges on customer bills. The equity investment by Government sends strong market signals and demonstrates shareholder support at a time when credit rating agencies have noted general market concerns in relation to the high levels of capital expenditure required in electricity infrastructure across Europe. In fact, since announcing the Government equity investment, Standard and Poor's rating agency has announced an improvement in its credit opinion for ESB, upgrading ESB's issuer credit rating to A from A minus. It is important to note that the State will receive an increased stock holding in ESB in return for this investment. The State will continue to receive dividends in proportion to its shareholding.",
                "I will now turn to the Bill's subject matter. I will begin by providing a brief overview of the most important measures the Bill addresses before providing a section by section summary of the Bill. The legislation before the House today has two main objectives. The first is to increase the statutory borrowing limit of ESB from €12 billion to €17 billion to finance the delivery of the PR6 investment programme. This increase is necessary to support the potential €15.2 billion expenditure by ESB Networks in the 2026-2030 PR6 period. The second objective is to provide for the issuance of capital stock by ESB in return for payment up to the value of €1.5 billion. The stock shall be issued to the Minister for Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation and the Minister for Climate, Energy and the Environment.",
                "Issuing capital stock which will be fully subscribed to by the State allows importantly for Government to attach the condition that the €1.5 billion investment be used specifically for grid infrastructure projects carried out by ESB Networks. It also ensures that the investment is reflected in the shareholding percentages of the company.",
                "At present, the State's shareholding in ESB stands at 97.4%, whereas the employee share ownership plan, ESOP, holds 2.6%. Employee shareholding ownership came about in 2001 when stock was granted to employees of ESB as part of an overall cost and competitiveness review agreement with the ESB group of unions.",
                "It is important to note that the Bill has been drafted to also enable ESB to issue stock to the ESOP in return for payment, should it choose to also invest in ESB to maintain its current shareholding percentage. The ESOP will have a period of up to 12 months following Government investment to make its investment. Should the ESOP choose not to participate in the equity investment, the State's shareholding will increase.",
                "An independent valuation is currently being carried out by EY for ESB and the shareholders, which will provide a valuation range for ESB.",
                "The valuation determines the price per stock and, therefore, the number of shares the Government will receive from its €1.5 billion investment and its final percentage holding in the company. ESB management has advised my Department that ESB employees are supportive of both the equity investment by Government and the ambitious PR6 investment programme. On a separate but important note, legal consideration has determined that the equity investment does not give rise to any issue of state aid.",
                "I will provide a section by section summary of the Bill, which has five sections. Section 1 provides for the relative definitions of the Bill. Section 2 amends section 4 of the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act 1954 to provide for the increase of the statutory borrowing limit of the ESB from €12 billion to €17 billion.",
                "Section 3 amends section 2 of the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act 2001 by inserting new subsections. The new subsection (5) provides for the issuance of capital stock by the ESB in return for payment up to the value of €1.5 billion; that 90% of such stock shall be issued to the Minister for Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation; and 10% of such stock shall be issued to the Minister for Climate, Energy and the Environment.",
                "The new subsection (6) provides for the procedure for the Minister for Finance to make payment to the ESB up to the value of €1.5 billion for the capital stock from the Central Fund; and the new subsection (7) enables the ESB to make a concomitant capital stock issue to the trustees of the employee share ownership plan, should the trustees choose to participate, to maintain their current shareholding percentage.",
                "Section 4 amends section 11 of the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act 2001 to insert a reference to the Minister for Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation in relation to expenses incurred in the administration of the Act. Section 5 contains standard provisions outlining the Short Title of the Bill and its collective citation.",
                "I commend the Bill to the House and I look forward to the debate."

                "I did not get a chance earlier to pay tribute to and congratulate Catherine Connolly. I also pay tribute to Sr. Stan who was a Listowel woman and a Kerry woman. In a week when we saw the outrageous attack on the house in Drogheda and convictions for racially motivated murders, I would love to know what she would have thought about the way the country is going. I pay tribute to her for all of her work with immigrants and the homeless over the years.",
                "Due to decades of underinvestment, bad planning and mismanagement by successive Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Governments, Ireland's energy system is not fit for purpose. Alongside rip-off costs and a deeply regressive approach to financing, our electricity grid is another example in a long line of Government failures. Due to paralysis, it is plagued by critical infrastructure deficits - we all saw this in the storms of last winter - that not only result in hundreds of millions of euro in wasted renewable energy every year, driving up the cost of energy, but have already stopped people moving into their own homes. The need for urgent action and significant investment in our grid is clear. As the Minister of State said, we need to future-proof it for generations to come, but in doing so it must be fair and just to the generations to come.",
                "While it is essential that we take a determined and ambitious approach, it is equally critical that the Government does not repeat past mistakes. The choices must shape Ireland's energy future in a way that delivers first for ordinary people and not for corporate interests. We all saw that when we had total control and State ownership of our energy markets, we had some of the lowest prices in Europe. Now, we have some of the highest. The Government must ensure there is no return to the snail's pace, stop-start approach of successive Governments. It must be subject to sufficient scrutiny and safeguards so that the public good is prioritised rather than treated as collateral damage. This is why the legislation is so important.",
                "The Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Bill 2025 legislates to allow for the €1.5 billion Exchequer investment in the ESB and furthermore to allow the ESB Group to increase its debt ceiling to €17 billion. It is important and necessary but how the money is spent really matters. The Bill mirrors the same strategic errors of previous Governments in potentially repeating our mistakes. For example, just like the summer economic statement, the revised national development plan and budget 2026, it is not only devoid of detail on the infrastructure the investment will deliver, but there is also no guidance on what projects should be prioritised. That is important and I will get to it. There is no mechanism for Oireachtas oversight, accountability or independent audit. As a result, this important investment of taxpayers' money will be vulnerable to waste and exploitation. It could fail to deliver the critical infrastructure that we need now and into the future. Ramming this Bill through without addressing these shortcomings will not undo the decades of failures. We should be careful not to repeat them.",
                "Let us look at the position we have today. Ireland is massively over-dependent on expensive imported fossil fuels leading to some of the highest energy prices in the EU. I do not think anyone will disagree with that. Ordinary workers and families are being ripped off because the energy bills they are charged here are, on average, €300 to €500 more than other countries. Unsurprisingly, the number of households in energy debt is at a record level having doubled in four short years. There are now 300,000 households that cannot afford to heat their homes or turn the lights on. The crisis will only deepen further following the impact of another round of energy price hikes combined with the cruel decision to withdraw and rip away the energy credits this winter.",
                "The constraints on our grid do not just impact energy affordability. In fact, grid constraints are placing urgently needed housing under threat. We saw that 80 families were prevented from moving into their homes last summer due to the lack of an electricity connection. They remain locked out. Recently, at an Oireachtas committee hearing, the ESB itself warned that limited capacity was placing new housing at risk. Grid constraints also place our vast potential for renewables and energy independence in jeopardy. Ireland saved €1.2 billion last year but we lost nearly a further €500 million in wasted energy. Ireland's crippled grid acts as a barrier to a thriving economy and balanced regional development, not only with electricity connections but wastewater treatment systems as well. All of this means progress is at a standstill when the reality is we need to be going a lot faster.",
                "Sinn Féin recognises the damage that has been caused by the failure to deliver on our grid and the results of that. Sinn Féin would mandate the planning, oversight and accountability that has been missing in the past, including a new responsibility for the ESB to provide a report on not just where the money has been spent, but where it will go in the future. This is the type of much-needed detail that has been missing, which is essential for credibility and certainty. To ensure this Government can no longer continue to treat energy affordability as an afterthought, our amendments will require the impact on consumer prices to be made clear. This will help to tackle the regressive nature of the current funding model because ordinary households should not continue to shoulder a disproportionate burden, while those who are causing energy surges, such as data centres, are left relatively off the hook. These reports should be laid before the Oireachtas initially within six months of the Act passing and then annually. We would also address the mismanagement of grid expansion to date. Successive Governments have rolled out the red carpet for data centres, while other essential infrastructure, such as housing, has been overlooked.",
                "Sinn Féin is not the only one sounding the alarm bell on this. The energy regulator recently highlighted the fact that the ESB Networks substation at Castlebaggot, which was initially intended to support new housing, was handed over to data centres. Even the Government's own officials have issued stark warnings about a business-as-usual approach. In May, the Secretary General of the Department of Climate, Energy and the Environment warned the Government that it must make a political choice between new homes and data centres. Similarly, officials in the Department of public expenditure also warned that Ireland's rapid growth in data centres is driving up household bills and gobbling up our energy capacity. All of the renewable energy increase that we will get will be taken by data centres. That is not right.",
                "While increased investment is essential, it must deliver for ordinary workers and families. We hope our amendments will address those concerns ensuring that the ESB's investment is directed towards the right political choices of public good rather than the corporate balance system. This Bill is an opportunity to address the failings in our current system. We believe the amendments are required to ensure we do not fuel them.",
                "I use this opportunity to call on the Government to address the deep unfairness in the cost, and to maintain and upgrade the grid. Data centres consume 22% of Ireland's energy demand, up from 5% in 2015.",
                "EirGrid projects will rise to one third by 2034. A single data centre can use as much electricity as Kilkenny city. However, under the current model a disproportionate burden falls on ordinary households. We have repeatedly urged the Government to restructure network charges and correct this inequity. However, not only have these calls fallen on deaf ears, but the draft decision on price review, PR6, which the Minister of State mentioned in his speech, will only further ingrain this unfairness. Under the CRU's draft price review, households and SMEs will see their network charges increase while large data users like data centres will see reductions of up to 18%. It is not just unfair; it is scandalous. The very companies that have driven up demand have been asked to pay less and ordinary people to pay more.

                "I emphasise the very real crisis faced by ordinary workers and families when it comes to heating their homes this winter. Over 300,000 households are in debt and there has been another round of crippling energy price hikes but the supports to ordinary people have been ripped away. The Minister of State said that this Bill will not reduce energy bills and will have no influence on that, which is a pity. When the gap between Irish retail prices and wholesale prices is one of the biggest in the world, energy companies have serious questions to answer about price gouging. We have repeatedly provided the Government with measures that would hold the energy companies to account, but they have been ignored. We deserve much better than what the Government is willing to give. We certainly need more than an interim report that only diagnosed some of the problems but delivered no solutions.",

The Bill must look at and deliver for housing, for renewable energy, for affordability and for ordinary householders. It cannot be another missed opportunity. We will continue to fight for a fair energy system and one that works for people and not for profit."

This week we saw the first analysis from the Government's energy affordability task force. The task force report illustrates the depth of Ireland's energy price crisis and outlined that more than 60% of electricity arrears are now long term. This highlights the lived reality of many households, who face significant difficulties in paying their bills and continue to see energy prices rise. Despite knowing this reality and knowing the positive impact electricity credits have had in previous years, the Government decided not to include energy credits in the recent budget. This is a clear slap in the face to households struggling with the ongoing cost-of-living crisis and the many people who simply cannot pay their bills.",

In the last year alone, over 300,000 customers lost power after Storm Darragh, 700,000 customers lost power after Storm Éowyn, and just last month nearly 50,000 customers lost power after Storm Amy. Many households lost power in all three of these storms for long periods of time. As we enter the winter storm season this year, there is real fear among many households about the potential for serious outages. With any increase in investment, there needs to be a serious focus on grid resilience.",

There is a clear lack of transparency and accountability in the current form of this Bill.

These are the critical projects that we need immediately to ensure our future. Instead, however, the Government has prioritised the building of data centres, which are devouring our grid capacity and directly impacting our ability to build homes.

We are all hearing it in our constituency offices, as I am sure the Minister of State is in his. Workers and families are being hammered with soaring prices at every turn.

                "I welcome the opportunity to speak about this Bill. It is one of significant consequence, not only for our energy system but also for our economy, environment, society and country more broadly. It deals with one of the most crucial challenges we face now and in the near future, namely, how we generate, deliver and pay for the energy that powers our homes, schools, hospitals, businesses and industries. How do we keep the lights on, and how do we do so in a fair and sustainable manner that ensures affordability for Irish consumers? Ireland’s energy landscape is being reshaped more dramatically now than at any point in our history, or at least since the ESB was established. We are living through a profound transition, trying to decarbonise our electricity system, at a time when the UN is saying we are on track to miss our target of limiting the rise in the global temperature by 1.5°C. We are trying to decarbonise while electrifying heating and transport and integrating massive new volumes of renewable generation, all while maintaining security of supply and trying to ensure sustainability and affordability for Irish households are paramount. This is no small task, and in that context this Bill has an important role. However, the Bill also has serious gaps in oversight, fairness, environmental protection and, crucially, managing the enormous energy demands from data centres that we need to address. I will return to those topics.",
                "The Bill amends the 1954 Act to give ESB Networks greater borrowing and investment capacity, increasing the statutory borrowing limit from €12 billion to €17 billion. It also authorises €1.5 billion in direct Government equity investment over the next five years, between 2026 and 2030, which is of course very welcome. The Government’s stated aim is to provide the legal and financial framework for upgrading and reinforcing Ireland’s electricity network to support the roll-out of generation, new housing, electric vehicles and climate adaptation works, particularly to ensure resilience against storms and other severe weather events.",
                "We have seen the huge damage that storms have caused in recent years. Quite frankly, we were not prepared for them. They have been hugely disruptive, particularly in the case of Storm Éowyn. As we all know, lives have tragically been lost in recent memory. All this is happening at a time when electricity demand is growing rapidly. By 2030, Ireland’s total demand could rise by as much as 40%, driven by the electrification of heat and transport, population growth and, as I will emphasise later, the astonishing surge in data-centre consumption.",
                "This is not a minor technical amendment; it is a strategic investment Bill that will determine where the State places its financial and infrastructural priorities for the rest of this decade. Therefore, it deserves a high level of scrutiny. I will begin with the positive elements. The Bill is an acknowledgement that our electricity grid is under severe strain. Much of our network was designed for a very different era, namely, one of predictable demand and centralised generation. Today, we have decentralised renewables, fluctuating generation and new kinds of load. Our grid was never built for this complexity. By increasing ESB’s borrowing limit and providing direct equity from the State, this Bill allows essential investments in transmission and distribution. That must include the construction of new substations, the upgrading of lines and the replacement of tens of thousands of poles and cables. It is not necessarily the most glamorous of work but it is critical to keeping our energy system reliable.",
                "I believe we will have separate legislation dealing with storm resilience. After Storm Éowyn, when over 750,000 customers lost power, it became clear that we could not continue to rely on a brittle network, dominated by overhead lines. I know we are not necessarily dealing with that issue today, but provisions for better vegetation management, undergrounding key lines and improving emergency-response capacity will be welcome and are necessary.",
                "In principle, we also support the aim of giving ESB Networks the financial capacity to invest at scale. Grid constraints are now one of the biggest barriers to renewable energy projects. Developers of wind and solar farms across the country are waiting years for connections because of bottlenecks. Without new investment, Ireland will simply not meet its renewable electricity targets for 2030.",
                "The Bill is timely and motivated by legitimate needs and recognises that grid infrastructure is essential to the green transition. However, a Bill that controls billions of euro in public funds should also control how that money is used, who benefits and what kind of system it builds for the future. On that front, the Bill is somewhat incomplete.",
                "First, there is the question of cost. This Bill involves investment at an enormous scale. Billions in new borrowing and billions more for capital works are required, yet nowhere in the Bill or its accompanying documentation does the Government specify what this means for the ordinary household’s electricity bill. The Department’s press statements refer to competitive borrowing rates and long-term benefits but, in plain English, that means the ESB will take on more debt, and that debt will ultimately be serviced through network charges – charges paid by households, schools, businesses, hospitals and so on. Some analysis has suggested that the proposed upgrades could increase bills by approximately €80 per household per year. That may sound modest to some, but for families already having to choose between heating and eating, it is not so modest at all. What are households getting for the extra charge? They are not getting cheaper electricity, at least not in the short term. They are being asked to fund long-term infrastructure that will primarily enable new industrial and commercial growth. At a time of record energy poverty, where over a quarter of households have fallen into arrears in the past two years, that is deeply problematic. A modern electricity system must be just as well as sustainable.",
                "We need to consider establishing more explicit consumer-protection mechanisms that may include, for example, mandating the CRU to publish an annual affordability impact statement outlining the cost effects of this investment and requiring measures to offset any regressive impacts.",
                "More broadly on the issue of consumer costs, we need to seriously consider ways of reining in energy companies and rethinking the deregulation of the energy markets. I have spoken about this previously. There are ways of going about it, such as carve-outs and EU rules, that I have outlined in this House previously. The ESB is in a somewhat unique position given it is a State asset and a former monopoly provider. Under section 21 of the 1927 Electricity Supply Act, which established the ESB, the ESB’s obligation was to charge at “such rates and on such scales that the revenue derived in any year by the Board from such sales and services together with its revenue (if any) in such year from other sources will be sufficient and only sufficient (as nearly as may be) to pay all salaries, working expenses, and other outgoings of the Board properly chargeable to income in that year”. In other words, the original mandate of the ESB was non-commercial, and it remained so for over 70 years. That provision was repealed by section 9 of the 2001 Act, which gave the ESB its commercial mandate. Can anyone really argue that there has been a step-change improvement for customers as a result of this commercialisation?",
                "There are also the issues of accountability and oversight, or the lack thereof, in the Bill. The Bill substantially increases the ESB’s borrowing powers but adds no new reporting requirements. That is not particularly good legislative practice. If a private company raised its debt ceiling by €5 billion, shareholders would demand rigorous scrutiny, yet here the shareholders, so to speak – the people of Ireland – are being asked to sign a cheque and just hope for the best. We need clear lines of accountability that could include annual reporting to the Oireachtas, for example, not necessarily just vague assurances from press releases. We need independent audit mechanisms that track project performance, delivery timelines and cost efficiency. There are over 500 capital projects planned under the investment programme. Which will be prioritised? On what basis? Who decides?",
                "How will we in the Dáil be informed if projects go over budget or fall behind schedule? We have seen in other instances, like the new national children’s hospital, that we only learn of budget overruns and delays because they appear in the headlines. The Bill should, and could, include a new statutory duty on ESB Networks to provide quarterly performances reports to the Minister and the relevant Oireachtas committee outlining progress, expenditure and projected completion dates for all major works above a certain value. That is the level of transparency the public deserves when billions of euro in public money are at stake.",
                "Any investment in our energy network and systems going forward must have decarbonisation and sustainability as its foremost considerations. It is worth pointing out that under the Climate Action and Law Carbon Development Act 2015 and the Climate Action and Law Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, the ESB, as a public body, is required to perform its functions in a manner consistent with our statutory climate objectives. However, in a position paper back in February, the CRU reported its opinion that the current provisions under the climate action Act do not provide a sufficient legal basis to allow it to explicitly mandate specific emissions reductions and offsetting measures, such as requiring that connection applicants put in place arrangements to ensure that emissions associated with the demand connection are fully abated from the time of that connection or on a set trajectory. That position might be unique to the CRU as a regulator in terms of the compliance obligations it can impose on third parties, or there may be similar problems with the enforceability of the climate change objectives as it applies to other State agencies and bodies. I hope this is something the Minister will check. In any case, given the salience of decarbonising our energy system in our fight against climate disaster, there should be the strongest obligations on the ESB to live up to its requirements under the climate Acts. I tabled an amendment to that effect but unfortunately, it has been ruled out of order. Nonetheless, I will reiterate that the ESB’s paramount consideration must be the performance of its functions in a manner consistent with the climate Act.",
                "As with all matters relating to our energy supply and national grid, perhaps the most urgent issue, and the elephant in the room, is data centres. This Bill completely ignores the single biggest driver of electricity demand growth in Ireland today. It is silent on the issue of data centres despite the fact that their impact is overwhelming the very grid this Bill seeks to reinforce. That is pretty unbelievable. Last year, data centres accounted for 22% of Ireland’s entire electricity supply. EirGird projections suggest that, without intervention, this figure could rise to 30% by 2030. To put that into perspective, one sector, serving a few dozen multinational corporations, could soon consume nearly one third of our national electricity output. This is not demand that can easily be curtailed. Data centres operate 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. The consumption is constant and inflexible. It does not dip when the wind stops blowing or shift when the grid is strained. The result is immense pressure on network infrastructure, particularly in the east of the country where these facilities are concentrated. Dublin, already one of the most data centre-dense cities in Europe, is approaching the limits of its transmission capacity. That congestion means a couple of things. First, renewable projects elsewhere struggle to connect because capacity is consumed by non-flexible industrial demand. Second, ordinary consumers face higher costs as new infrastructure is built primarily to serve that demand.",
                "When data centres disconnect from the grid and use their own back-up generation, this back-up is almost always fossil fuel-powered. It is simply not a sustainable solution. Let us be honest: the bulk of this €1.5 billion investment will go towards meeting the needs of large energy users, not households. Yet, the costs are socialised across all consumers. That is not sustainable or fair. If we are serious about a just energy transition, we cannot ignore the imbalance created by this sector. We have to ensure that large-scale users contribute proportionality to the infrastructure costs they generate. The de facto moratorium on new data centre connections in the Dublin region, introduced in 2021, was a necessary stopgap and should be introduced nationally. We in the Labour Party have consistently called for a moratorium on all new data centres but clearly the Government intends on ploughing ahead and green lighting more and more of them.",
                "That being the case, new or expanding data centres should be able to demonstrate access to renewable, self-generated power sufficient to meet their operational load. I have drafted a Bill, which I intend to introduce shortly, to give effect to such a provision. We should also be looking at requirements for all large energy users to participate in demand response programmes, installing on-site storage or flexibility technologies to ease strain on the grid. In addition, we need to explore the introduction of a large-user capacity levy, earmarked specifically to offset household and small business network costs. In our alternative budget, the Labour Party proposed a levy of €20 per MWh on data centres, which would raise over €140 million, and a reform of the PSO to ensure they contribute equitably. If they use disproportionately more energy, they should pay proportionally more. That is basic fairness.",
                "Furthermore, we should be looking at the wider planning framework. I am yet to be convinced that the national energy demand strategy is robust enough in setting out clear criteria for where and how high-energy use facilities can connect. We are essentially building infrastructure blindly without any demand side governance. If we continue on the current path, yes, we might end up with a grid that is stronger but it will be one that is more unequal, carbon intensive and dependent on the very industries that make decarbonisation harder.",
                "I wish to touch on the issue of delivery. The targets are laudable, such as 50,000 pole replacements, 319 km of new underground cables and 70 new or upgraded substations. Targets alone do not deliver progress, however, as we are all too aware. We know from recent experience that large infrastructure programmes often face cost overruns, planning delays and procurement challenges. Global supply chains remain fragile and skilled electrical engineers are in short supply across Europe. If the ESB cannot deliver these works on time and within budget, the benefits to consumers and renewables developers will be delayed and the costs will inevitably rise. It would be prudent if annual delivery plans were required and perhaps an independent mid-term review in, say, 2028 to assess whether the investment programme is meeting its objectives and to allow for adjustments if it is not.",
                "Beyond delivery, we need to ensure we are building the right kind of grid. The 21st century grid must be smarter, not merely bigger. It must be capable of real time balancing, integrating distributed renewable generation and enabling households and communities to produce and store their own electricity. If this Bill becomes only a programme of steel and concrete, with more poles, lines and substations without a parallel investment in smart technology, we will have built yesterday’s grid for tomorrow’s challenges.",
                "There is one other matter I wish to raise. This is more of a procedural matter rather than one relating to the substance of the Bill. It is an insight into how I spent my Sunday night. It is about the lack of a consolidated version of this legislation. The Law Reform Commission, as the Ministers of State might know, does great work in consolidating a lot of our laws, but its resources are limited and it does not provide a consolidated version of the electricity supply Acts. Ideally, all of our legislation would be published in a consolidated format rather than leaving it up to individuals to piece together amendments that may have be enacted separately, sometimes over decades, to understand the current state of the law. The Government should publish consolidated laws for everyone’s benefit, as is done in the UK. It is extremely difficult, even for someone like me who is legally trained, to decipher which parts of an amended Act are being changed for the purposes of reviewing and analysing this legislation. Every Department when proposing amendments to existing legislation should at least provide legislators with that Department’s unofficial consolidated versions of Acts so that we can fully and fairly scrutinise them.",
                "I will provide one small example. The explanatory memorandum states this Bill will amend section 4(4) of the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act 1954, which sets the ESB’s borrowing limit. We are told that this limit is being changed from €12 billion to €17 billion. All of this fine, but the limit set under section 4 in 1954 was £25 million. This was amended by a 1982 amendment Act to a limit of £1.6 billion, but how did it get to the limit of €12 billion? Where do I see that so I know that it is changing? It turns out that the limit in the 1954 Act was amended again and increased to €12 billion under section 22 of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act (Amendment) 2021. All I am saying is that, as legislators, we should be able to focus our efforts on looking exactly at the substance of changes to our laws, but we cannot be sure exactly what our existing laws are saying in the first place because they are made up of this mishmash of amendments that have been passed over 70 years. This needs to be made clearer for us as legislators. Aside from us, ordinary citizens should be entitled to see easily and in an accessible and transparent manner what our laws actually are and what their right and entitlements are. This in so many respects is an access to justice matter. There is a need for reform in how we publish our laws. This is something I will raise with the Minister for justice and pursue separately.",
                "This Bill has merit. It recognises real challenges and it provides a framework for investment that Ireland desperately needs, but legislation of this magnitude should be judged not only be what it enables, but what it neglects.",
                "We need to ensure balance between public and private interest, between environmental protection and infrastructure speed, between affordability and ambition and between power for profit and power for people. This Bill will shape our grid for decades to come, so let us not build a grid that serves Silicon Valley better than the homes of counties Dublin, Clare or Donegal.",
                "We must build a system that delivers clean, reliable and affordable electricity for every household, every business and every community in Ireland. That means stronger oversight, explicit and robust consumer protection and respect for the environment. That also means a clear, enforceable plan for managing industrial electricity demand, particularly from data centres. If we make these changes, this Bill can become a cornerstone of a just, resilient and sustainable energy future. If we do not, we risk locking ourselves into a model that is unfair, unsustainable and politically untenable."

                "I am thankful for the opportunity to provide an update to the Chamber on the progress being made with responding to the significant damage caused by last winter's storms, particularly in forestry. The volume of timber normally felled over a 2.5-year period was blown down overnight during Storm Éowyn. The latest damage assessment maps show that 27,000 ha of forests were windblown, with 11,400 ha impacted in private forestry. This equates to approximately over 40 million trees blown down by that storm. Counties Leitrim, Roscommon and Cavan were worst affected, where 48% of the windblow occurred. Considerable damage was also caused to electricity lines and other infrastructure by the storms. Immediately after the storm, I established a windblow task force, which has since finalised an action plan to guide our response, identify bottlenecks and rectify them. I thank the people from the different sectors and the officials from my own Department who really worked diligently with regard to putting all of this in place and getting things going. There was an awful volume of work to be done.",
                "Considerable damage was also caused to electricity lines and other infrastructure by the storms. To further speed up the process, we have allowed the use of both thinning and clear-fell licences in removing storm-damaged trees. Our data now shows that 77% of windblown trees already have a felling licence issued by my Department. My Department also continues to progress the introduction of a reconstitution scheme for storm-affected forest owners. As I have said previously, I will ensure that forest owners that carry out clearance or replanting now will not be disadvantaged when the scheme will be introduced. That is very important for those forest owners to know.",
                "I acknowledge the contribution Coillte has made to helping home and farm owners who are impacted by storms to have their power restored. Coillte's staff and contractors were immediately available. They worked tirelessly and in hazardous conditions to clear trees and open road access immediately after the event. Coillte has also laid the satellite mapping of the storm damage and I have worked with it in close co-operation and my Department to establish the impact across all counties that were affected. Since then, Coillte has moved on to prioritising the salvaging of the storm damage material. This includes the corridors along ESB lines where possible. This includes a detailed assessment of areas of potential risk through drone images. Coillte is working closely with the ESB. I have been informed that the power lines that are a priority for adjacent to tree felling works for energy reasons. Based on this information, Coillte has developed a programme of works to incorporate these prioritised power line clearance works into its own harvesting programme. Work is well under way in that regard. Both Coillte and the private forestry industry have undertaken huge efforts to deal with the damage. Currently, more than 90% of the harvesting capacity in this country is working in windblown areas. Again, that is very important. A total of 90% of the machinery involved in harvesting is working on windblow sites. It is important to emphasise that the clearance of windblow areas is a complex, slow, difficult and dangerous process.",
                "As the Minister of State with responsibility for farm safety and for safety in general in those type of hazardous conditions, I am placing a big significance on the importance of the work, the protection of our power lines, keeping energy going to people's homes and the protection of the people doing that hazardous work. That is also very important. That is a top priority for all of us. Both my Department and Coillte are continuing to engage with the Department of Climate, Energy and the Environment and the ESB on the forestry corridor working groups. I thank the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien very much for his work. As part of this co-operation, my Department has contributed to the winter resilience plan 2025, which has been finalised by ESB Networks earlier this year. My Department has also inputted extensively to the framework for the draft legislation being discussed. It is my intention to ensure that the ESB will be fully empowered to better manage this issue in the future. To be clear, we have in place long-standing forest corridor requirements in legislation to protect the electricity network where it interacts with forestry land. In fact, the ESB and its representatives are empowered under current legislation to lop or cut any tree, scrub or hedges which obstructs or interferes with electric wires. Such works are a matter between the ESB and anyone acting on its behalf and the landowner in question and do not require a felling licence from my Department.",
                "The proposed Bill, however, aims to enhance the resilience of the electricity grid and therefore provides additional, proactive measures that allow for the establishment and maintenance of designated forestry corridors within existing forestry and the maintenance of clear land around existing infrastructure, which, of course, is very important. When debating the Bill, I would like to ensure that the new legislation provides the protection needed for the public, but it also has to be proportionate for the forest owners in the State who will also be affected. I thank everybody for their work on this. I acknowledge the work of the Minister and of all the other people. The people who are a lot more important in this debate are not the people in this House in suits, with all due respect; it is the people who had to go out at night, working to clear the lines and trying to restore power in bad and dangerous conditions. They are the people who we all want to thank and we want to say how grateful we are for them. There is no worse place a person could be than inside a forest with trees criss-crossed every way and dangerous power lines knocked and understanding and knowing how important it is to get the power going to those homes and people. We had them throughout County Kerry. We had them throughout the country and in the counties I have referenced. People had no power or heat. It was horrendous for everybody.",
                "I sincerely thank the workers and the people who strive so hard and put so much effort into trying to clear the lines. That job of work was done. It is now up to all of us from a political point of view to make sure the strengthening legislation is there to help this work to be carried on in the future and to protect the property rights of the people who will be affected. I thank everybody. This is not an us-and-them situation; this is all of the people inside of this House. All we want is safety, power going to homes, heat going to homes, the continuity of supply and being fair to the people who own the land. That is all we are trying to achieve."

When I made inquiries as to why that was the case, apparently the electricity infrastructure just is not there to take the power from them. It is absolutely extraordinary. These wind turbines are there a very long time. I just have to ask: what the hell is going on? Apparently, a significant percentage of the wind turbines that are dotted all across County Donegal do not actually feed into the grid. This is just crazy. Then there is a direct link between this failure to plan properly in terms of infrastructure and in terms of what people pay. People are being crippled here. The Government knows this. Homeowners and small businesses are being absolutely crippled with electricity costs. We know that wind energy plays a critical role in reducing those costs.",

We need a direct link between investment from the State into the ESB infrastructure and reduced costs for homeowners. People are being fleeced. We used to have the cheapest electricity in Europe. That was when we owned our own infrastructure and the company that charged the bills. We handed it over and wrecked the model we had. What is worse is that the wind turbines we have put all across the country are not feeding into the grid. We are not getting the full benefit of them to reduce costs. This investment has to be real, with real accountability and a real plan."

Unfortunately, during the previous term the Minister for energy got into a really bad habit of rushing Bills through the committee without proper scrutiny and it looks like the Minister of State is taking up that mantle and doing similarly. As a principle, all Bills should go through PLS unless there is an urgent or emergency reason not to. I do not think that is the case in this instance and it certainly was not the case previously. I ask the Government to stop using that mechanism. The Government members within the committee will always have the majority vote so I ask the Government to please allow Bills to go through the proper process. It will mean a much more robust debate and better legislation at the end of the day. It is not wasted time but very much valuable time. I ask the Government to do that.",

It is something that we need to learn an awful lot of lessons from and we need to see it as a wake-up call. The reality is that our grid is not resilient enough and our infrastructure is not ready. Indeed, our emergency services were stretched to their limits in their response. I welcome the Bill because I believe it can play a part in getting us onto a proper footing to deal with similar instances. I hope we do not have to deal with too many but we need to be ready and prepared to deal with them if they do happen.",

I also welcome the fact the increase to the ESB's borrowing limit will unlock over 500 capital projects, including 181 km of new overhead lines, 319 km of underground cables, 70 new and upgraded substations and 50,000 pole replacements. Reading out those figures, you realise that the scale of the job ahead of ESB Networks and the teams, the workers on the ground to whom the Minister of State referred, is enormous. It is important that we invest in the ESB to help us achieve that modern and resilient electricity system. We saw an awful lot of gaps in the legislation and the different frameworks when we saw what Storm Éowyn did, particularly to forestry corridors. It is important that we manage the vegetation around the grid to stop these kinds of outages.",
                "This is all positive. This is a positive step from the Government. However, there are certain aspects that we need to consider. One is that while we are putting in this investment, we must consider the costs and how people are going to pay for that grid infrastructure. Care needs to be taken to ensure we are not disproportionately impacting people who cannot afford any higher costs on their bills. It is important that we also ensure there is prioritisation of those resources, particularly for residents, people who are vulnerable and, indeed, small businesses. What we are seeing at the moment is, unfortunately, investment in a grid that will ultimately benefit large corporations through the supporting of the whole data centre industry. I will come to that shortly. We need to make sure that if the lights go out, we can assist the people who are most vulnerable and most at risk. We must ensure that if the lights go out, we can make those homes resilient and not focus our efforts on those corporations.",
                "The Minister of State talked about PR6. As I have raised at the committee, PR6 will only invest in the grid to support the current level of data centre applications. It is not for any future data centres. According to the affordability task force, we will see an increase of 45% in electricity demand over the next decade. There is a real worry that even with this level of investment and the investment being given under PR6, if we continue to allow increases in the electricity used by data centres and this proliferation of data centres, the grid will still not be sufficient. It is only going to shore up the grid and secure the issues for the current level of data centres and not any future ones. That is a risk and I ask the Government to look at it.",
                "When I became a TD six years ago, one of the first motions I brought forward was on data centres and seeking a moratorium on them. It was not that the Social Democrats were against data centres per se - there was not a blanket objection in principle to data centres - but we wanted to see strategic management of data centres because it was clear, even back then, that this was not happening. We were seeing projections that were forecasting that by 2030, 30% of our electricity demand would be coming from the data centre industry. When we look at what actually happens in Europe, where the relevant figure is 2% to 3%, we see that Ireland is being disproportionately impacted by the demand from data centres on our electricity grid.",
                "Over the past few years, we had instances where there were risks of brownouts and blackouts because the grid was not sufficient and was not able to deal with the demand, primarily from data centres. What did we have to do? The Government had to rush out and purchase generators that cost hundreds of millions of euro to ensure the data centres had access to a grid. It is really important that when decisions are being made about data centres, we know how many we can afford in this country from a climate perspective, from an energy security perspective and from an energy pricing perspective. The more pressure and the more demand that is put on a commodity such as electricity, the higher the price goes. Over the past few years, we have seen so many prices skyrocketing. Ordinary individuals are unable to keep on top of that. I believe a large part of that is down to the demand that is being placed on the trading and use of electricity. I ask the Minister of State to look into that and not ignore it.",
                "We are not saying there should be absolutely no data centres; we are saying there is a need to put in good data centres that are efficient, can work in a complex electrical environment, can actually act as storage and can perform a function as part of that whole system. Do not just roll out planning permissions or approvals for them or roll out the grid because it is very costly to do that.",
                "I also want to make the point that when the Government invests in the grid, it puts additional costs on consumers. There is an economic reality there. I was interested to see in the report by the affordability task force that it stated that, essentially, the network charges from the CRU's recent decision will put an increase of approximately €29 per year onto a typical customer bill. I want to raise this issue with the Minister of State because I am quite concerned about it. I raised it with the CRU over a month ago. It must be six weeks since I raised it with the CRU at a committee meeting, but it appears that nothing has been done. The Government needs to ensure that when it is making investments in the grid and when additional charges go onto consumer bills, there is transparency about these charges and the energy companies do not use the Government's investment in the grid to hike up prices, because that is exactly what we have seen.",
                "In September 2025, Energia announced an increase in its energy prices. I think it was going to add an extra €200 or so onto people's bills. Energia stated that these price changes are \"now unavoidable\" due to \"ongoing, substantial increases in electricity, system operator and network charges\" and \"that these costs are required to recover the costs of ensuring security of supply, addressing network constraints and investing in the electricity grid.\" That is incorrect. That is misinformation that is being put out to hundreds of thousands of Energia customers. I raised this with the CRU representatives at a meeting of the energy committee six weeks ago and asked them to look into it, but that press release is still on the Energia website. It has not been amended at all to reflect the reality that the €200 it is putting the bills up by every year is not down to grid improvements, security of supply issues or network charges. Energia is putting the price up because it is gouging. It will blame the Government, and investment in the grid, for doing this. I ask the Minister of State to raise this matter. I have serious concerns that the CRU has not addressed that issue after six weeks. It is the CRU's job is to protect customers and to ensure there is transparency in the information provided to it, but it is not doing its job properly.",
                "Another area I want to raise in regard to the CRU is arrears. A report from the affordability task force yesterday mentioned that in June, 13% of electricity customers and 27% of gas customers were in arrears. It is crazy that the CRU has not published the most recent data and that we are still working from the June figures. When CRU representatives came to the committee meeting six weeks ago, I asked them what the latest figures for arrears were, but they could not tell me. They said they would publish them shortly and still have not done so. That information should have been available in the context of last month's budget. When the Minister of State is making policy decisions, he needs to know how many people are in arrears and how many the numbers are going up by each month. The Minister of State needs to have that information to hand because otherwise he will not be able to identify the scale of the problem. Again, the CRU is responsible for this. I have sent two or three emails to the CRU during the past six weeks asking for that information but it is not being provided. Obviously, the CRU is not listening to me. I ask the Minister of State to raise this issue with it because it is the body that is meant to be protecting customers.",
                "There is a lot here. We will have an opportunity to discuss this important legislation over the coming days. There needs to be a short-term focus on how we can protect people this winter if there are more storms, how we can get ready and how households will be resilient not just to price increases but also to any disturbances because of storms coming in. It is really important but we will have further opportunities to debate that. I ask the Minister of State to talk specifically to the CRU about the points I have raised because I think they are important."

                "I welcome what we are discussing and I welcome this Bill. As a TD and someone who was elected as a councillor numerous times, I have always called for investment in infrastructure, especially, with my local hat on, in the Leixlip and Celbridge areas where we have had electricity outages. Since I was elected as a TD, we have seen outages in Kildare and nationally as a result of the storms of last winter.",
                "Ultimately, anything that brings extra investment in our electrical system, such as the €1.5 billion we are talking about today and the ability to seek the additional loans required, has to be welcomed. I thank the Minister and his team for their foresight and belief in this. I thank the Minister for Finance for putting this forward on budget day ahead of time, considering the demands.",
                "I am a member of the infrastructure committee, which will meet tomorrow with the housing bodies and the large developers in Kildare, Ballymore and Glenveagh. Their representatives will come to the committee meeting. I know one of the key issues they will be talking about will be Uisce Éireann and the challenges they have with water, but the electricity supply will be a key focus as well.",
                "I have met many developers, no more than other Deputies, and I understand the sorts of issues they face. When houses have been built across north Kildare and elsewhere, we have not been quick enough to get the electricity supply in. That is one of the issues. I hope this legislation will go towards putting in the infrastructure in time to ensure we do not have those delays. My only fear is this: will €1.5 billion be enough to continue with that? I am sure there will be a multi-year approach whereby we will continue to have investment in our electricity system.",
                "Obviously, from a national perspective one of the key items we are looking at changing is how we do our electricity and how we work at electricity. Renewable integration is key. We are talking about offshore electricity, solar electricity and getting everybody on board in that regard. This is key but to do that we need to update our grid. With this extra money coming into the system, we will be able to invest to ensure we can avail of solar power units.",
                "I do not wish to go off topic - perhaps it is in keeping with the topic - when I mention that Freddie and I were lucky enough to be in the new Lidl net-zero shop in Maynooth. We got a tour and we saw how a new development in a new shop with solar panels will be able to be cost-neutral from an energy perspective. I think we have to go that way. As our previous speaker outlined, we have continuing new demands on our system. This is where we have to talk about supporting our economic and digital growth. We all know that data centres will be required. The Social Democrats were talking against data centres and about moratoriums, potentially, being put on them. At the same time, we cannot ignore the reality of the future demand that may be coming with the technological changes we have seen in recent years and continue to see, especially in the new realm of AI investment across the world. We can talk about moratoriums but we need to ensure Ireland is not left behind. This legislation will go towards that. We need to ensure we have an electricity system that is able to keep up with the best of other countries. Countries like Denmark and England have faced many of these challenges. It has been less of an issue in France, which has the nuclear energy option that many other countries do not have and we do not have. Ireland is in a different space but we need to ensure that with this investment we are able to open the opportunities where possible and where we are best placed to do so, and that includes data centres.",
                "As I said at the outset, we need to be conscious of one-off events when we reflect on whether our system will continue to be fit for service in the future. We have climate change and increased storms. There are weather systems that come across, and are probably coming across in the next couple of months. The Minister of State, Deputy Dillon, knows this better than anyone given that his own area was probably one of the hardest hit by the storm earlier this year, and indeed by the outages that were in his area. I know the Minister of State will be looking for this sort of investment to ensure we are in a more robust and better place in order that we can get things back on track sooner, if possible, and in order that networks would not be out any longer than necessary. We can talk about the upfront €1.5 billion investment but by giving the ESB more flexibility to finance its own investments, we can ensure we have the best network possible over the coming years.",
                "This Bill is about building a secure future and a secure electricity system. Once again, I welcome the Government's initiative on this."

While it includes technical measures to increase the actual borrowing limit for the ESB and to provide for additional share capital to be issued, in essence it is about making an additional investment in our electricity supply. This is incredibly important in an Ireland that is growing and will have additional demands in the future. Even in today's market, there are communities in my district that are experiencing difficulties because of issues with electricity supply capacity, with appliances being damaged in their homes and so on. I welcome the additional investment.",
                "I also welcome the investment in the provision of interconnectors, particularly the North-South Interconnector. The investments here will be an important tool in order to deliver that. The interconnectors are really key because while they increase Ireland's electricity security, they also give us an opportunity to export renewable energy, an area where I believe we are going to be world leaders. We have already made great strides. The passing of the Maritime Area Planning Act 2021, which the Minister of State, Deputy Dillon, and I soldiered on at the committee, is having an impact but we need to do more and the Government needs to do more.",
                "The provision of renewable energy is something that we could see being implemented very quickly now. One of the issues with the renewable energy system, particularly wind energy, relates to surplus wind energy that happens at night. When energy is not able to be used by the grid, it is effectively earthed into the ground. This is the reason I brought forward the Energy Poverty Reduction (Use of Surplus Renewable Energy) Bill 2025. The idea is that we come up with a national strategy for that surplus energy. Energy that is otherwise being wasted or earthed into the ground every evening could be a digital or virtual district heating system right across the country. It could be heating the hot water tanks of many people across the country. It could be charging electric car batteries and so on. Having a national strategy for surplus wind energy is really key. I urge the Government to consider my Bill and to put every effort into bringing forward a strategy in this respect. I know the Ministers are supportive of it and I look forward to progress on this. The idea is that we can use surplus wind energy to tackle fuel poverty.",
                "The work we have done includes the fuel supplement scheme, which has been massively expanded. If I am right, I think I heard a Minister say this morning that 26% of homes now are included under the fuel supplement scheme. That happened because we significantly expanded eligibility for people over the age of 70. These are people who worked hard all their lives, who bought their home and who own their home. They are now eligible for the fuel supplement. This also makes them eligible for the better energy warmer homes scheme, which allows them to get a full wraparound insulation system. This has a massive impact on their energy bills. There is a lot of connectivity between the different schemes we currently have. The measures in this Bill add to the overall investment.",
                "With regard to the budget, there were targeted measures and there were general measures, as there have been in past budgets. The Opposition criticised us for not introducing more targeted measures in previous budgets but they seem to have forgotten that this time around when we made more targeted decisions. The 9% VAT rate was really key in keeping energy prices low. If that not had been done, people right across the country would have been paying significantly more for their ESB bills. That is really important but it does nothing to address the issue around energy prices. Energy prices in Ireland are too high. There are lots of reasons for that, some of them structural and some of them to do with our connectivity to the rest of Europe and so on. We have to make sure the energy companies know that their feet are being held to the fire on the issue of price.",
                "I agree with other speakers about the CRU. It needs to do more to make sure consumers are getting the lowest possible price, given the mandate of the CRU. It is incredibly important. When people in our constituency offices say they are afraid to turn their heating on because they are not sure what the impact will be, or when people on a pay-as-you-go scheme cannot shop around to avail of different providers, we know how important the issue of energy prices is. While I welcome the Government's measures on the 9% VAT rate, which is really important, and on the fuel poverty schemes, I believe we need to do more on energy prices. I welcome the Bill."

People in counties Kilkenny and Carlow are paying a heavy price for the consecutive failures of the Minister of State, Deputy Dillon, and his colleagues to invest in our energy infrastructure. It is an issue my constituents continually contact me about. There is a question I would love to see answered. Is your top priority for energy residential housing or is it data centres? Which of these is at the top of the Minister's priorities? We all know it cannot be both. When I see the waves the Government has made to support the building of more and more data centres, putting immense pressure on our national grid, it makes me wonder.",

The Government's own experts have warned it about the risk this poses to building the homes we desperately need. We are now seeing that families across Ireland cannot move into new homes because they cannot get connected. I find it astounding that in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis, data centres are set to see their energy bills drop by 18%, while families and workers across Ireland are facing the most expensive winter they have ever seen for energy bills.",

Data centres storing unnecessary data about what type of advertisements to hit us with do not contribute positively to our society. It is the people of Ireland, not data centres, who contribute positively to our society. It is the people of Ireland, not data centres, who need to see their energy bills drop. The public cannot be expected to foot the bill for the data centres. It is simply not right and it is deeply unfair."

If we can find €1.5 billion for capital stock, surely we can find the resources to restore energy credits and provide targeted supports for those most affected by energy poverty.",
                "I support investment in our energy future, but I cannot support a system that asks ordinary people to foot the bill while removing the very supports that helped them survive in the past few winters. We also need to acknowledge the people who are doing everything they can to keep the lights on, such as the ESB crews who go out in all kinds of weather, often in dangerous conditions, to restore power to homes and businesses. Their dedication deserves our thanks and our respect but they too need a system that works, one that is properly resourced, well planned and future-proofed. The recent storms have shown just how vulnerable our infrastructure is. Trees falling along roads have knocked out ESB poles, causing widespread outages. This is not just bad luck; it is a sign of poor planning and underinvestment. Red tape and outdated systems continue to hold us back.",
                "That is why I welcome the appointment of our Galway West councillor, Noel Thomas, as our spokesperson for planning reform. He has already raised important concerns with me, including the need to simplify claim forms for those affected by storm damage in Galway West and in other areas affected by the serious storms that hit. These forms must be easy to understand and quick to complete, especially for older people and those under pressure. Councillor Noel Thomas told me that Storm Éowyn caused unbelievable damage in his own constituency, as it probably did in the Minister of State's constituency. That is a very serious concern for the constituents of Galway West and it is an issue the Government needs to take up. It is fine to say we are investing in infrastructure, but the companies themselves are making a fortune out of ordinary, everyday people who work hard in this country and the Government does not seem to understand or sympathise with that, as can be proven by the last budget.",
                "We must act now to strengthen our infrastructure, cut through bureaucracy and ensure people can access support when they need it most because this is not just about energy. It is about dignity, fairness and whether we are building a country that works for everyone or just those at the top. I still ask the Government to reconsider the decision it made in the budget not to give energy credits to customers. These people come into my clinic every weekend. They are suffering in every way they can be hit by the Government with extra taxes. This was one little bit of relief they got just before the previous election, with the promises and all of that. That was great, but now the election is over and it is time for people to suffer. That is not good enough."

Let us be honest in this House: the Government record on energy policy is a record of failure. Ireland now has the second highest household energy prices in the entire European Union. Eurostat confirms we now pay around 48 cent per kilowatt-hour, compared with 31 cent across Europe, 27 cent in France and 30 cent in the Kingdom of Spain.

He does not have the moneys to do the property up, despite what is available from the Government in terms of grants. I have spoken to small business owners from Ballincollig to Little Island who are telling me they are closing early or closing one day a week just to save on energy and lighting costs. That is not progress. It is an absolute scandal. What has been the Government's response? It has been to let the ESB report profits of €868 million. While the State dividend rolls in, the households of Ireland have to tighten their belts, are told to put on an extra jumper or, as the Minister of State's predecessor suggested, share the heating with their neighbour and go from house to house. That is not an energy policy. It is daylight robbery, dressed up as climate virtue.",

Every builder, developer and employer in Ireland can tell you the same thing. The biggest barrier to growth is not the planning red tape; it is the supply of power and water. Projects have been delayed because there is no grid capacity, factories are stalled because there is no connection to take them and housing estates are refused planning because the system simply cannot cope, in respect of both energy and water. That is not the fault of the planner, the engineer or the local authority. It is the failure of national leadership. It is a failure of plans and a failure to invest in the future and think ahead.",
                "Ireland has some of the highest taxes in Europe and the largest budget surplus in the history of the State, yet the State cannot guarantee enough electricity or water to build homes or businesses. That is the definition of incompetence on the Government's side. If this Bill is to mean anything, it must mark the end of complacency and the raising of the ESB borrowing limit to €17 billion must come with strict conditions. There must be full transparency around the borrowings, an independent audit and legally binding timelines for the grid expansion. Timelines for grid expansion are vital. Every euro must go on real infrastructure, stronger cabling, faster connections, rural upgrades and modern sustainability.",

I say clearly to those on the Government benches that before they lecture us on public sustainability, make sure people can afford to turn on the lights. The Government is not addressing that."

                "The two biggest problems this Government has are the delivery of infrastructure and rip-off Ireland. The two elements are inextricably linked. The inability to deliver on infrastructure is hammering families throughout the country. It is adding to massive misery and difficulties for so many families in so many areas in terms of housing, electricity, water and transport. One of the reasons that is happening is that in this State at the moment, Government inaction around planning, permits, tendering, etc., has allowed that aspect to delay projects. Right now we have some of the slowest planning permissions delivered, the slowest permitting, the slowest licensing and the slowest tendering in the whole of the EU. Judicial reviews go on for years. As a result, key infrastructure gets snarled up in a process. None of that is by accident. It has not evolved by itself but as a result of legislation that the Government has been involved in for the past 15 years.",
                "The second issue relates to the fact that electricity is holding up so many other aspects of infrastructure delivery. Right now, hundreds of homes in this State are not being built or are not connected and not lived in as a result of that lack of electricity. The lack of electricity infrastructure is slowing down the building of homes. That is an incredible indictment on the Government. In terms of price, spiralling costs are currently affecting families. There are 412,000 households in this country in fuel poverty. It is incredible that nearly half a million households in this country in fuel poverty. The prices of electricity are extremely high. Energy prices in Ireland are three times the wholesale prices. That is one of the biggest gaps in the world. The Government often tells us there are lots of reasons we have higher electricity prices than anywhere else in the world. However, the fact is that those reasons all lie under the wholesale price. Electricity prices here are three times higher than the wholesale price. The gap between the retail price of electricity and the cost of producing it is one of the highest in the world at the moment.",
                "Electricity companies are failing to pass on the profits they are involved in. Why would they not? The ESB is a semi-State company. It is delivering Government policy. It is salting the people. It is involved in super-normal profits in terms of its revenue. The ESB made €706 million profit last year in a cost-of-living crisis. That is an incredible situation.",
                "Even the pricing of electricity happens within this State as a function of the dearest element of the production of electricity. The Government is artificially increasing the price of electricity to make sure it is being priced at the dearest element, which is often gas. The Government's legislation is allowing for that.",
                "In regard to retrofitting, about which I have heard people talk, only 22,000 homes reached the gold standard of B2 retrofitting last year. That is well short of the half a million households that are in the target for 2030. In terms of any retrofitting, only 54,000 homes were retrofitted at any level last year. There are 1.6 million homes in need of retrofitting. That means it will take 50 years to get to a retrofitting situation where families have a comfortable home with low energy costs.",
                "The issue of data centres messes with my mind. We are told that we have to do so much to reduce the level of electricity usage and that we have to do our best to make sure we are a low-carbon economy. At the same time, the Government is flying high in terms of the increasing number of data centres coming into this sector. Data centres use 22% of all metered electricity in this State. That is way out of kilter in terms of the European Union which is about 3% or 4%. That figure is likely to reach 30% by 2030. There is one rule for the small family dealing with electricity but a different rule for the large multinationals. AI is going to drive that through the roof.",
                "In terms of Storm Éowyn, two weeks after that storm 13,000 homes were still without electricity. Most of those homes were in the west or the midlands, showing again that this Dublin Government is forgetting about the west of Ireland in terms of infrastructure. One of the reasons it was hit so hard was that so much of our infrastructure is overground. Yet, this Government wants to proceed with the EirGrid north-south interconnector which is overground. We have been waiting for this infrastructure for 15 years. A bull-headed instinct by the Government to overground it is delaying it. Only 15% of homes, families and farms are going to allow EirGrid onto their property to build it. Some 85% of farmers are not going to allow it. It is going to remain in limbo for years as a result of this Government's instincts to force it overground.",
                "We need a situation where we have investments but we have to free up the process, the red tape and bureaucracy that has been added on to the system by years of Fine Gael Governments that are slowing down the delivery of much-needed infrastructure. Unless we get to that we are just pouring that money into a bottomless pit. I see no real evidence that this Government means business when it comes to getting rid of the bureaucracy and red tape that are slowing down infrastructural development in this country."

It will allow for the creation and maintenance of forestry corridors and vegetation management, subject hopefully to environmental obligations under the Habitats and Birds Directives. I have no problem with the legal mechanism to make an additional €1.5 billion equity investment in the ESB to part finance the PR6 energy grid investment programme. However, I am more interested in the larger scale investment required. Obviously, we note the proposal to raise the statutory borrowing limit from €12 billion to €17 billion to help to finance proposed future capital projects, including the new lines, the underground cables, the upgraded substations and the 50,000-plus electricity poles. It is a massive investment that is needed but we need to see the detail of what is coming to modernise and future-proof the grid.",
                "We are talking about a potential €10 billion to €13 billion investment plan up to 2030. However, a couple of things need to go alongside this. I note a private wires policy statement was published in July that outlined scenarios whereby private developers can build and own electricity lines to connect generators to customers. I do not have an issue with that in principle but I do have an issue if it is purely to allow companies to create their own private sections that will impact on the grid. My definition of private wires would be more about an area like a housing estate that has a wind turbine beside it or an array of solar panels where people can be offgrid in a situation like a storm so they are able to switch over to their own group generator. I would like to get more information on that type of thing.",
                "I agree that data centres need to be able to produce their own energy and feed into the grid rather than taking out of what we already have.",
                "To be positive, I notice the microgeneration support scheme and the clean export guarantee tariff already in place for exporting excess renewable electricity to the grid. On a massive national scale in terms of having the potential to be exporters, we have to first of all make sure that we are efficient in our usage. In that context, I agree with colleagues in terms of subsidising the bills people are facing right now. It does make sense to continue it. I welcomed the continuation of the 9% VAT on electricity but I do not see anything going towards getting people to reduce their energy consumption. Back in the 1970s, we used to hear about closing doors and switching off all plugs because there is seepage from leaving on Wi-Fi at night-time or from leaving USB chargers plugged in. There is not enough information out there to help people to reduce their bills. I have noticed that constituents, especially older ones, do not change over their tariff after a year has elapsed. They are stuck in an overpriced standard tariff when they could be saving money. I agree that the Government should be helping people during these tight times. However, we should also provide people with more education about how to reduce bills themselves.",
                "I have mentioned in previous contributions that the visionary aspect should be that we should be a net energy exporter, assuming we have capacity for ourselves. To get to that, we need to have more consistency and more clarity on the energy storage policy framework, for example, which has an immediate procurement target of 500 MW for the transmission system and 500 MW for demand flexibility for the distribution. However, there are criticisms about this. There is no long-term concrete mechanism or any example of urgency. I would like to see clarification in terms of long-duration energy storage.",
                "That would be beneficial, as would conversion to green hydrogen. We also have a lack of cohesion between the stakeholders in terms of the planning, EirGrid and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU. I do not see the joined-up thinking to meet our climate action targets or our energy production targets. If we want to get to net exporter status, we need to fast-track our investment in the grid. While this €1.5 billion is welcome, we need a tangible €13.5 billion-plus investment to happen in the next three to four years."

This Bill is about providing the electricity infrastructure that we need to build houses to start to erode the deficit in housing provision. If we do not do this, we will not be able to do it. It is that simple. This is an absolutely necessary measure to allow the ESB to put in place the electricity infrastructure that is going to allow houses to come on stream faster and across the whole country. If there was no other reason to welcome this Bill, that would be a good reason to welcome it. I hope the ESB and EirGrid will be able to do that as fast as possible.",
                "I listened to the debate and heard the criticism of, for example, electricity prices. I join with those Deputies. I do not understand why the Commission for Regulation of Utilities has allowed electricity prices to go up as far as they have. I understand there was a peak in generation costs at the time of the outbreak of the Ukraine war. That is no longer there. In fact, with 40% of our electricity generation coming from renewables, I do not understand why we have not dealt with that problem.",
                "We talk about it in the context of the budget and whether or not we should have targeted measures or ongoing supports. Leaving that debate entirely to one side, there is a simple solution to this, and it is to tackle the energy companies about the cost of electricity. It is unjustifiable. Maybe I do not understand and there may be a perfectly good reason, but I have not heard it yet. In the absence of such a reason, we should be going back to the CRU and asking it to explain why it has allowed electricity prices to become as inflated as they have, particularly in the context of our European neighbours. I do not really understand why we have allowed ourselves to become an outlier in that regard. The cost of electricity is something that I hope can be addressed when the infrastructural deficit is addressed by this investment.",
                "Mention has also been made of microgeneration, something that Ireland has been absolutely behind the curve on. Households all over this country are willing to use solar panels or other ways of microgeneration including geothermal, but they are not facilitated by the network to do that in real terms. While it may be technically possible to put electricity back into the grid, there is no real incentive to do it. The unit price that a householder gets for putting it back is negligible even compared with the wholesale price of electricity. That is not going to encourage people to use the facilities at their disposal to feed the electricity generated within their homes, farms, businesses or wherever it might be back into the network to contribute to the overall amount of electricity available.",
                "The other issue I have heard people refer to, including Deputy Gogarty, is long-duration energy storage. That is something that could definitely be a target of infrastructure spending. When we put the target together for the number of electric vehicles on the road, one of the big pluses for me was that we would have cars charging overnight, drawing electricity from the grid and essentially being a national battery for electricity that could then be used during the day when there is a greater demand on the grid. These mobile batteries would be there, having absorbed the excess energy available overnight. I do not know what plans the ESB has for large-scale long-duration electricity storage, but where we have good renewables, particularly in wind, we should be taking that energy and making sure it is there when there is a need for it on an ongoing basis. I would welcome any news the Minister of State might have on the plans within this infrastructure development to increase long-duration electricity storage.",
                "The other issue raised was data centres. I join with my colleagues in their concern about the extent that data centres are gobbling up electricity. I do not agree that we should have a moratorium, but I do not understand why every data centre in this country is not covered in solar panels to begin with. To the greatest extent possible, they should be doing what they can to ensure they are using renewable electricity. I recognise that when they take electricity from the grid, it might be renewable electricity, but they are using electricity that could be used by somebody else, who is then relying on electricity that is not renewable. The greatest concern I have about data centres is that when they do not get enough electricity from the grid, they are relying on on-site diesel generators to feed their electricity needs. That has to be worst possible way to generate electricity, particularly on the small scale of a data centre. We need to take steps as a Government to ensure that data centres are ideally not doing that at all, but certainly to the very minimum extent possible.",
                "Finally, I will make a point on the construction of this Bill. The principal Act referred to in the Bill is the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Act 1954. As I understand it, that Act has been amended 20 times since then. When you pick up the Electricity (Supply) (Amendment) Bill 2025 and look at it, it is illegible. Section 2 will say that section 4 of the principal Act is amended by amending the reference to €12 billion to a reference to €17 billion. When you are reading the Bill, that means nothing. It means nothing in isolation. Section 4 has been amended over and over again. In order to understand what this Bill actually says, you have to go back and dig up 20 different pieces of legislation to actually understand section 4 of this new amendment Bill. Why do we not take the original section 4, repeal it or restate it in the new Bill so that somebody reading the legislation can know what it does? Of course, you can read briefing documents, but legislation should be accessible to people. They should not have to trawl through years and years of legislation to find out what it means."

There was a debate here in 2013 and the then Minister was asked for regulations, to level the playing field and to ensure that the voices of communities and individuals were heard. To this day, we do not have the regulations that are necessary to protect local communities and to set out the criteria for the development of these large-scale windfarms.

They are not showing any degree of compassion. People cannot get in touch with them unless they use the freephone line and queue forever. They could be cut off in the middle of their conversation. If they send an email of complaint, God knows what will happen to it. I followed up one of them today in my constituency office. The phone was cut off. I could not get through on the email and when I finally submitted a third-party authorisation, it was sent back to me because the man signed his name as \"Ger\" followed by his second name, when his name is \"Gerard\". They asked me to get the man to sign the full name, \"Gerard\". These are vulnerable customers who are appealing to big energy companies making huge profits to sort out a meter or help them to pay a bill, or they are asking why a single man in a house would generate electricity up to €3,000 of a bill. There is something wrong. They will not reach out to the customer, as any other company should and would, to help them resolve the issue and get paid.",

                "I turn to the domestic and commercial cost to SMEs. Farmers who pay their bills, in particular dairy farmers, have come to me and said that, in the middle of milking, down goes the electricity. They have a power failure. When they report it to the energy company, they get absolutely zero traction to sort it out. Small businesses are closing because of the cost of electricity and nobody seems to be reaching out to stop companies charging them far too much for electricity.",
                "The number of domestic and commercial customers waiting to be connected is truly shocking. They are getting no respect or response from the big companies. I had an experience on the Hebron industrial estate with a commercial operator. It is impossible to get the answer so that a supply can be arranged and housing provided for those on waiting lists. There is so much to be done. I ask the Minister to please take note of what is being said by me and other speakers, and to act on it."

What I say in this contribution is not directed at the Minister of State; it is directed at the entire system I have been facing ever since being elected to this House. I welcome the Bill and the opportunity it provides. The billions of euro in investment in ESB Networks are badly needed. I am a member of the climate and energy committee and we are constantly discussing how Ireland's electricity system will be developed over the next four years we are in government. This is essential infrastructure. It underpins huge issues we face across Departments, from the housing crisis to economic growth gridlocks and the renewable energy transition. I love how we call it a transition; it is not a transition but the complete scrapping of our current energy system and the building of a new one. We are changing, like the entire world is. This scale of investment, with the hundreds of projects and the substations, has been needed for years. I welcome the funding and the fact the ESB is getting reduced rates. It is helping to secure Ireland's energy future.",
                "We will face huge fines running into billions of euro regarding our energy. That is not 100% confirmed by the EU but if it is the case we need to do everything now. I have spoken about this in the House multiple times. That is why we cannot ignore the wider truths. It is a fact that our energy system is not keeping pace.",
                "I recently visited multiple solar farms across Ireland during the break. The owners and engineers told me they are turning off solar farms because the grid cannot take it due to curtailment. I understand the Bill is trying to tackle that but it needs to be fast-tracked because it does not make sense that we are turning off Irish solar farms to then import, as the previous Deputy mentioned, electricity from the UK that is from nuclear plants and other projects that they have, and buying off them when we have our own solar farms. It does not make sense to the public or to me. It is just bureaucracy and outdated policy. We saw this before with the North-South interconnector. It was identified in 2008 and is still not built. That critical infrastructure is delayed not by technology but by indecision.",
                "When I entered this House, one of the reasons the Ceann Comhairle ruled I was not a Member of the Opposition was that I claimed private wire policy was a win for me and my team. That policy is something I have been working on since January and I met with the OPLA today to review the Bill I am working on. The Bill is for small-scale local issues, to help eco-villages and small industry; it is not going to help big industry."

Germany, the UK and Denmark are doing it. I understand the Government is bringing forward a policy and I welcome the fact the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, announced that, but it needs to be fast-tracked. When I knock on doors in my constituency, I find people are struggling with energy bills. Private wires will reduce bills because of the demand on the grid being used by big energy. If they can take that off, this will reduce the demand and the cost per unit.",
                "We constantly discuss in the climate and energy committee the curtailment we will face with the ORE being built across Ireland at the moment. It is great to see. There was a €90 million investment in Cork Port. It was great but many experts say we need to put more than €90 million in for when these large vessels come in to develop offshore renewable energy projects. To make it as effective as possible, more needs to be going in. I asked two weeks ago for the maritime law to be changed so the Department could put this on. It would be very good if this could be looked at and fast-tracked. If we could build infrastructure at our ports in the west using offshore renewable energy off the coast of my constituency, we could tackle the curtailment, take in the surplus energy, build electrolysis centres with private wires and have long-duration energy. The end goal is being as efficient as possible. No other country has the potential we have on our coasts to build our grid. With this great Bill, which I welcome, it needs to be done correctly. We need experts there. It cannot be brought down by inertia and indecision.",

It is all well and good investing in the grid and energy infrastructure, but what good will that do if we continue having homes in entire communities, and indeed businesses, living with blackouts. If we do not do the simple things right, like cutting back trees that knock down power lines, we are missing the point entirely. A reinforced grid is one thing but maintaining continuity of supply often comes down to the small, local and practical details. Given that the State will grant an additional €1.5 billion in shares or capital stock in ESB, we also need firm assurances that this level of taxpayer investment will be protected.",

I am not at all convinced that the economic, environmental or infrastructural arguments relating to wind energy, for example, are as credible as people think, and I am extremely concerned about the lack of protections for many communities throughout the State. In my constituency of Offaly, I have constituents complaining about infrasound from a wind farm. They are not being listened to. We have no guidelines and we have absolutely no protections for those communities. I have called time and again for a moratorium on wind farms until the guidelines are published but, more importantly, until the guidelines give balance to this whole debate and argument and protect communities and their rights and so far that is not happening. It is shocking to see wind farms being imposed on communities that are completely opposed. I have also had an issue with farms in Offaly where it is affecting animals. Not alone is it affecting the residents, but it is affecting the animals in the fields. I have had reports of livestock having to be moved when a wind farm went into north Offaly. That is not fair. We need a balance between communities and corporate entities.",

We are all elected here to represent communities throughout the State, not to represent the energy companies. That needs to be tackled and there needs to be fairness.",

It surely needs to improve when we see communities left without electricity for days and weeks in places such as Cordal, Brosna, Gneeveguilla, Glencar and Knocknagoshel earlier in the year because of a storm. I have to mention one aspect of that operation. I want to thank all the workers that put their lives in danger trying to restore the lines, day and night, to get the power going. I have to commend them very highly. ESB management, who were overseeing this and ensuring the workers were out there, refused to make drones available to them to find the outages in dense forestry and terrain that was hardly traversable. If they had the facility of having a drone to go out, check the line and see where it was broken down, it would have saved hours, days and weeks of time for those poor men working hard on the ground trying to rectify the situation. I want the Minister of State to ask why that did not happen in Kerry and why drones were not made available to the crews on the ground. That is one of the questions.",
                "The other problem I have is that we hear this massive sum being invested in the ESB, but what are we doing for our consumers that have to pay so much? I see here a list. Energia imposed a 12.1% increase from 9 October last. Bord Gáis raised its electricity unit rates by 13.5% and its standing charges by 12%. SSE Airtricity prices rose 9.5% and those of Flogas 7%. Why is there such a difference in the first place? Flogas's increase is just half what they others are. There is no law or order, or control, at all here. Pinergy had an increase of 9.83%. Do we have a regulator? Where is he? Did he ever open his mouth? Is he asleep all the time? What is happening the regulator or is he there at all? That is what I am asking. This is the only sector where companies seem to get what increases they want and the poor consumers have to suffer these massive charges.",
                "Many people are cajoled and forced into this situation that they have to use so much electricity. They were told to do this. The building energy rating, BER, rating was forced upon thousands of people that have built new houses by the banks and other lending institutions. They have to have the lowest BER rating and to do that means they cannot have a chimney with an open fireplace or whatever form of heating they desire. This is why they have been forced into electricity only. The Government then will find that when the power goes out, there is no one to help them. Two council houses that I pass every morning when I leave Kilgarvan have been unoccupied for over a year. There was people living in them up until then. The reason is they were selected for complete retrofitting at a cost of over €100,000. There was nothing wrong with the houses only to paint them up and do a few jobs to them, not to take off the roofs and take out the chimneys which is what is happening. They are gone at 18 occupied houses over in Rathmore now, trying to force people into taking out their little stoves and fireplaces. I had an elderly lady bawling crying on the phone to ask Kerry County Council not to take out her little stove. That is what is happening. There are vacant houses around the place that are not being got ready for reuse or to leave other tenants into them, and they have no place to live at the present time.",
                "Many farmers and others are generating electricity themselves. They were encouraged to produce enough that they could sell it and now we find the grid is only going the one way, bringing electricity to them. The infrastructure is not there to sell the electricity to the ESB. The ESB, in some cases, will only take one third of what they can produce. There is something wrong here and I ask the Minister of State to look at that. It is very serious.",
                "Hundreds of people have been on to me that their power is being turned off and that they cannot pay the bills.",
                "This is what they find when they have these heat pumps that are running all the year round. They were able to carry on themselves and get a few bags of turf or a bag of coal. We appreciate the fuel allowance, but it is not as going as far as people need it to go with these exorbitant electricity bills.",
                "I was amazed, when it was made known at the agricultural committee meeting last week, that some of these people who are building commercial anaerobic digesters can get a grant of up to €5 million from the State. Imagine that. What this is about is meeting our 2030 targets for generation of energy. This is being paid for by taxpayers. It is everything and anything just to meet our targets, regardless of what it will cost. Can you imagine what a €5 million grant would do for people who are trying to pay the electricity costs they have? In the first place, I think I was the only one who voted against the timing for the 2030 emissions target deadline. I was the only one in Dáil Éireann. Every other man, woman, party, Independent and individual voted for 2030. I did not. I know a lot of people will get hurt and squeezed in between.",
                "I mentioned retrofitting new and occupied houses against the wishes of tenants. I go back to the way people are being forced and encouraged to use electricity. When we realise that the power can go out at any time, we hope that the ESB and Ministers are ensuring that we will not have outages like we had before, when trees were left too close to wires. What has happened until now, whether it happens all the time or not, is when the ESB is told about trees rubbing off wires, it is only allowed to cut them back a metre from the lines. That is not good enough. That is not adequate because tall trees fall the length of themselves onto the wires. I ask for that to be reviewed to ensure no tree is left standing. They should not be left standing along any road either because we see people in cars being killed. These trees are overshadowing wires and roads. That should not be happening.",
                "I again go back to the exorbitant costs and the regulation, which is not there. It is immaterial. While we support the investment, I do not support what is happening to customers. We do not have a regulator. He is not doing his job. It is the Ministers' duty; this is their time in position. They are the Ministers of today. They should ensure the energy regulator gets out and does his job, and gives clarification and transparency to what is happening. Are the energy companies entitled to these increases or are they not? I feel they are not."

I will, most importantly, keep my comments focused on the content and purpose of the Bill.",
                "It is perhaps worthwhile to begin by restating the purpose of the Bill. It is very much focused on creating capital stock in the ESB in return for payment. This will be the mechanism by which the Government will provide the €1.5 billion investment in the ESB to support critical development of our electricity and grid over the next five years, as committed to in the updated national development plan. This investment will be crucial, as many Deputies said, in modernising, building that resilience and reinforcing our electricity network infrastructure. It will also support the Government's key priorities in infrastructure, housing, competitiveness, investment growth and climate action.",
                "Within that, there will be a robust accountability and oversight mechanism for the expenditure by ESB Networks. Indeed, that will increase significantly in price review 6. The company will be obliged to report to the CRU, on a programme by programme basis, on cost, performance, delivery and the timeline for delivery. The Minister will also require ESB Networks, as part of this investment, to report quarterly on network expenditure, network financing, delivery and debt, which is very important. There will be a clear and transparent reporting mechanism for the Minister. That has been an important theme that needs to be emphasised as part of this. It is also important to recall that the State itself will receive, on a receive-return basis, a return on its €1.5 billion investment and, as the major shareholder, on ESB profits via payment of dividends. The Government's investment will be complemented by additional privately sourced debt, funded by the ESB, to finance the delivery of the overall price review 6 investment programme. The Bill will ensure that it also provides for the increase in the ESB statutory borrowing limit from €12 billion to €17 billion.",

It will enable the connection of hundreds of thousands of new homes - as I said, we have an ambitious target of over 300,000 homes over the term of this Government - improve connectivity and accelerate the connection of new sources of renewable electricity. It is another important piece of legislation that demonstrates the Government's commitment in meeting our critical infrastructure needs as a State and balancing the needs around housing, economic growth and employment in our economy in delivering the key infrastructure we require.",
                "I will respond to some of the key themes and questions raised by many Deputies. One related to high energy prices. Many Deputies raised their concerns around the impact of these high prices on households and businesses. We fully understand these concerns. Many Deputies will be aware that a number of factors give rise to higher energy costs right across Ireland. One of the principal factors is our current reliance on fossil fuels, in particular, imported gas. We are very much reliant on imported gas, which is particularly vulnerable to price volatility in the international wholesale gas market. We are very much focused on building a more renewable base. Electrification provides a route not just to decarbonising our energy system but also reducing our dependency on imported gas. We, along with many of our neighbours, very much feel the impact of our vulnerability to reliance on gas as our main energy source. We are making great strides in substituting our fossil fuels with indigenously generated wind and solar energy. This journey to a clean energy source is very much part of this programme. Electrification can only be achieved through investment in our electricity grid. That is what we are focused on through this Bill.",
                "In addition, the €1.5 billion investment in ESB, which the Bill we are discussing will facilitate, will help keep consumer costs associated with the PR6 infrastructure programme to a minimum by ensuring the ESB maintains a high credit rating but also can borrow at low interest rates.",
                "In terms of supporting householders and businesses on the more immediate basis, I again highlight some of the key measures Government is progressing to help current energy costs, including the extension of the reduced VAT rate of 9% on gas and electricity. We also increased the weekly fuel allowance by €5 from January 2026. That will provide an additional €140 to over 400 households during the annual fuel allowance season. We are extending the €400 tax exemption from profits from micro-generation of electricity to 2028. We are also providing a range of grants to include solar PV on homes, businesses and farms to make it easier for people to improve their energy efficiencies and produce their own energy. We have also received confirmation from the main energy suppliers that the hardship funds for those struggling to meet their energy costs will also be made available to households over the winter.",
                "Deputies asked how much investment has been allocated in facilitating new data centres. I assure them that price review 6 takes many Government targets into account including the connection of up to 50,000 new homes a year, up to 1 million electric vehicles and currently contracted data centre demand. The programme for Government commits to developing a comprehensive plan to accelerate energy generation connectivity and the planning process. That plan will be guided on the approach around data centres, which provide huge importance within our enterprise system, but we need to provide certainty to the industry when making short- to medium-term investment.",
                "Regarding future grid investment and ESB profits, a number of Deputies asked about grid investment. To date Ireland has invested in the grid at a similar pace to our EU peers, maintaining and upgrading EirGrid as required. Ireland needs to go through a period of change in the use and demand of electricity. Adapting our grid for this increased demand for energy is critical in order to progress our decarbonisation progress.",
                "I am confident that the legislation before the House today is an important step in future-proofing our grid for generations to come. I acknowledge the significant work of the Attorney General, his officials, and officials from both the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation who have worked with my departmental officials here today in drafting this important legislation. I also thank the members of the Joint Committee on Climate, Environment and Energy for meeting officials for a technical briefing in advance of granting a waiver on the pre-legislative scrutiny. I also thank Deputies from all sides of the House here today for their interest and contributions. I look forward to the early consideration of the next Stage of the Bill taking place tomorrow."

                "It is clear that the cost of sending children school is rising and pushing more and more parents into significant financial hardship. Budget 2026 has failed to deliver the investment and vision which our education system so desperately needs. The Irish League of Credit Unions has reported that the cost of sending children back to school this year has increased since last year. It says that the costs often reach up to €1,560 for secondary school students and €1,450 for primary school students, increases of €154 and €364, respectively. These costs are putting extreme pressure on families who are already struggling with the spiralling cost-of-living crisis. Some 27% of secondary and 14% of primary school parents say they have had to use savings while 15% and 8% respectively had to take out a loan or borrow from family or friends to cover the cost of so-called voluntary contributions.",
                "Schools have been left short in terms of an increase in the capitation grant called for by teachers' unions. I am sure the Minister of State is aware that the cost of insurance, heating and energy and the day-to-day running costs of schools across the State have increased significantly. The insufficient increase in capitation funding will leave schools struggling to keep up with their bills. There is no doubt that parents will be relied on to try to make up the difference, to try to subsidise what is supposed to be a free education system. The Catholic Primary School Management Association has warned that parents will face a hike in voluntary contributions to plug funding shortfalls. It estimates that €54 million would be needed from so-called voluntary contributions to subsidise so-called free education.",
                "Parents also face new expenses for digital devices. The Minister of State will be aware that one in four secondary schools have moved to using digital devices rather than traditional textbooks. One digital device costs an average of €430 per child. Some parents who cannot afford to pay for the device up-front then pay what the Society of St. Vincent de Paul has dubbed a poverty premium as instalment payments can add up to a higher price. This is pushing those struggling most with their finances into greater debt. Like Terry Pratchett's boots, it is expensive to be poor. To add to this, this year the Government has decided to reintroduce the State exam fee, leaving parents with yet another expense.",
                "In this context of ever-increasing cost to families, we bring forward the Education (Affordable School Uniforms) Bill for Second Stage debate this evening. The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission says that restrictive school uniform policies are stifling competition and driving up costs. In short, it says the Minister's 2017 circular is not working. Our Bill would address this. It would mandate all schools to adopt a cost-conscious uniform policy ensuring clear labelling of optional versus mandatory items to prevent unnecessary spending; multiple retail options for uniforms allowing parents to shop around for best value; minimal use of expensive branded items such as embroidered tracksuits to avoid excluding students from activities; stability in uniform policies so items can be reused or passed down to siblings; support for second-hand uniforms through swaps or sales; and compassionate enforcement of uniform rules where financial hardship is suspected.",
                "Barnardos, the Irish League of Credit Unions, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission and others say costs for parents are increasing and that specific new measures are needed to help them. This legislation will be a good step on that road and the Minister should support it."

Those bright faces fill our social media feeds but what the photos do not show are the stress, the struggle and the sacrifice of the parents or guardians behind the camera, the sleepless nights worrying about how to afford it all. For far too many families, 54% of them, going to school is not a joyful occasion; it is a financial burden. Some are forced to cut back on essentials, even food, just to make sure their child has a uniform or a pair of shoes that fit. This is shameful in a so-called modern state.",
                "Uniform costs alone are spiralling. Hundreds of schools have a uniform policy that requires crested uniforms often with only one supplier meaning parents have no choice but to pay whatever price is set. We all know how fast children grow.",
                "Jumpers shrink, jackets get lost and the bills keep piling up. On top of that are the so-called voluntary contributions, estimated at over €54 million this year, forced on parents because this Government has failed to properly fund our schools. One parent of a child in a secondary school has paid €272 so far this year for mocks fees, study blocks, lockers and career outings, and that is only by the start of November. This is before uniforms or digital devices are taken into account.",
                "Inequalities keep growing. The Government’s plan for leaving certificate reform risks creating a system where well-funded schools pull further ahead while other schools, starved of investment, fall behind. Even the so-called hot-meals scheme is a postcode lottery. Parents in Clare are calling it a scheme of frustration with poor-quality food. Some schools in Clare are unable to afford even the electricity to heat the meals, and others are unable to access the scheme at all due to procurement and supply issues. Therefore, once again families are left to fork out for packed lunches on the back of empty promises.",
                "Teachers’ unions and parents have been clear: schools need proper funding and increased capitation grants. However, this Government has not listened. Budget 2026 once again fails our parents, our teachers and our schools. When will we see the day when back-to-school photos show not just the smiles of children but also the relief of parents who no longer have to struggle or sacrifice to give their kids a fair start? Let us make that day come sooner rather than later. Let us end the yearly cycle of stress and financial strain. I urge the Minister to support this Bill, stand with children, parents and schools, and support families."

                "Families right across south Kildare are at the pin of their collar. Week after week, my office receives emails from people who have to choose between heating and food. Scores of working families across the county are at risk of homelessness from rising housing costs because of new Government legislation. Costs keep rising, yet the Government decided to make families even worse off in this year’s budget. On top of rip-off electricity, insurance, food shopping and medical costs, school-related costs represent just one more area where families are being fleeced. Eighty percent of schools ask for voluntary contributions. Many schools are forced to pass the cost of facilities on to parents due to inadequate capitation. Families increasingly have to pay out for digital devices. According to the Irish League of Credit Unions, back-to-school spending is €364 more expensive this year than last year for primary school and €169 for secondary school.",
                "Uniforms remain a huge cost for families. We know that certain schools still have uniform policies that require several crested and embroidered pieces, not only on the jumpers, pants and polo shirts but sometimes even on sports clothes and rain jackets. Frequently, a sole local provider has a monopoly over these, and this drives up the price. Schools also need to be directed not to change their uniform policies unnecessarily – a measure that would help to keep costs down over time.",
                "We also need to consider second-hand schemes and have centralised guidance and support for such initiatives, as provided for in this Bill. Ireland is the second-largest producer of textile waste in Europe after Belgium. We consume 53 kg of textiles per capita per annum, according to www.changeclothes.org, which is more than double the EU average. We have a serious problem with consumption patterns and waste management systems in this country, and there is no doubt that school uniforms represent a chunk of that problem. Anyone with children will know they often need a new uniform every year, sometimes twice in a year, which leads you to wonder what happens to the outgrown uniforms of children who do not have siblings to hand them down to or who simply cannot pass them down due to crests. Chances are they are not recycled. I see real opportunity under this Bill for the Government and schools to take leadership on this issue and allow schools to institute a sustainable model and a mini-circular economy and mindset at community level."

In recent years, families have faced significant increases in the cost of the weekly shop, excessive increases in the costs of necessary utilities such as electricity and gas, increases in rent, and – every August – the high cost of returning children to school, with school uniforms being one of the biggest costs. The cost of a uniform is not just once off; it is yearly for most families. Children, particularly teenagers, grow out of their uniforms each summer, requiring further investment by parents.",
                "The Irish League of Credit Unions has noted that compared to 2024, costs have increased by €364 for primary students and €169 for secondary students. Generally, students wear the uniform four days a week and a school-labelled tracksuit once a week, so parents must buy a tracksuit, at least two school jumpers, two school shirts and two pairs of pants or skirts.",
                "A constituent I spoke to who has one child in secondary school in Limerick outlined the amount he had to spend on school uniforms this August. The school opted this year to redesign the school tracksuit, adding more cost for parents. The father I spoke to advised that he had purchased two school uniforms at €31 each and one school tie at €8. He opted to purchase school shirts and grey trousers but not from the recommended provider. He paid €50 for a school tracksuit top and an additional €36 for the school-labelled tracksuit pants. He advised he spent nearly €200 on school attire this year. He remarked that he was fortunate to have only one child in the school at the moment, but that child is a growing teenaged boy, so next year, if this Bill is not introduced, the family will face the same costs again. With the cost of everything in the State spiralling out of control, this is just not sustainable for working families anymore. Parents face high uniform costs and not long after their children return to school, they face the so-called voluntary contribution that schools seek. I do not blame the schools for this; they are cash-strapped themselves.",

The school, she advised, is holding a fundraiser not for anything new and shiny but just to afford day-to-day costs. Parents are worried. Fifty percent of them say they are worried about back-to-school costs, with many relying on loans or savings to purchase essentials. Our Bill provides that only iron-on or sewn-on crests should be required for school attire and that the monopoly in the supply of school uniforms should be ended, allowing parents to purchase required clothing from an expanded number of clothes shops.",
                "The Government has failed to address the funding crisis across schools. It did not increase the capitation grant by €75, as recommended by unions and other stakeholders, but by just €50. The burden falls on cash-strapped parents to make up the difference. I ask all Members to support our Bill and provide some alleviation to those families struggling to meet ever-rising school costs."

The Deputy’s motivation is clear and sincere and shows genuine concern for families facing the very real costs that come with the new school year. I share that concern. I am aware that for many parents, the start of the new school year can be financially stressful, with new uniform and transport costs arriving all at once. This is why the Government has made affordability a central focus of our education policy. However, I cannot accept this particular Bill today. This decision is not about rejecting its intent; it is about recognising that we are already taking significant, evidence-based steps to achieve the same goals in a more comprehensive and sustainable way.",
                "As colleagues will know, school uniform policy has traditionally been a matter for each board of management, reflecting local needs and traditions. However, since the publication of Circular 0032/2017, the Department of education has made clear that schools should take steps to ensure uniforms are affordable and accessible to all families. The circular sets out clear and practical guidelines for schools: uniform items should be generic and available from a range of retailers, not tied to just one supplier; iron-on or sewn-on crests should be used instead of embroidered ones; parents should receive a full list of required items and their likely costs at the best-value stores; exclusive supply arrangements must be subject to regular tendering; and schools should consult parents on how best to reduce costs. These measures aim to make a real difference but we recognise that more can be done. That is why a working group, including representatives from the National Parents Council and education partners, is reviewing Circular 0032/2017 to strengthen and update it. The group will engage directly with parents, children and young people to ensure the voices of those most affected are heard.",

That is the principle at the heart of the Education (Student and Parent Charter) Bill, which is progressing through the Oireachtas and expected to go to Committee Stage before the end of this year. When enacted, this legislation will require every school to consult parents and students on key policy issues and activities. It also sets clear expectations with regard to communications, transparency and respect between schools, parents and students. It will ensure that families are genuine partners in decisions about their children’s education, including how schools manage costs. This is a collaborative approach rooted in trust and responsibility which will achieve far more than issuing a set of prescriptive guidelines.",
                "In respect of broader Government measures to reduce costs, uniforms are one part of the cost burden families face. This is why the Government’s strategy is comprehensively tackling the full range of expenses that come with schooling. This year marks an historical milestone in Irish education policy. From September 2025, all students in the free education scheme, consisting of almost 1 million students and young people, will receive free books and core classroom resources. This represents an investment of over €170 million and a full delivery of the programme for Government commitment to provide free school books for every child. Schools will manage the provision directly, ensuring resources are used effectively and sustainably. This is one of the most significant steps taken to remove cost barriers in the Irish education system.",
                "In the context of capitation funding, we have also taken major steps to support schools with their running costs. In budget 2026, the Department of education secured €39 million to increase capitation funding, giving schools greater flexibility to cover running costs and reducing reliance on parental contributions. This includes an increase of €50 per pupil in primary school and €20 per pupil in post-primary school. There are additional supports for DEIS and special schools as well. Over the past three budgets, capitation funding has increased by nearly 50% at primary level and 28% at post-primary level. This is a significant uplift in capitation funding.",
                "We also maintain our commitment to affordable and accessible school transport. The school transport scheme, which Bus Éireann operates on behalf of the Department of education, has expanded significantly over the past six years. The number of children and young people using the service has grown from under 120,000 pupils in 2018 to over 178,000 pupils in 2025, which equates to an increase of close to 50%. Of those 178,000 pupils, over 100,000 mainstream pupils who are eligible for transport are facilitated, as well as more than 49,000 pupils who are receiving concessionary tickets. In addition, in excess of 23,000 pupils are travelling on dedicated school transport services for children with additional needs and more than 5,500 pupils from Ukraine are also facilitated on these services.",
                "Investment in the school transport scheme has more than doubled from €200 million in 2018 to €512 million in 2024. This investment is extremely welcome as the scheme and associated costs continue to grow. Deputies will be aware that there have been many discussions on school transport here, at the committee on education and in the Upper House. We are committed to ensuring a further expansion of services in the years to come. In budget 2026, there is an extra €69 million to meet demand, especially for students with additional needs, and to offset rising operational costs.",

These payments were issued automatically to eligible families who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments. Families who do not receive the payment automatically can apply directly to the Department of Social Protection. The allowance supports eligible families with the cost of school uniforms and footwear ahead of the upcoming school year. It provides €160 per child aged between four to 11 and €285 per child aged 12 years and over in second level education. Eligibility for the back to school clothing and footwear allowance was extended in 2025 to include foster care families. The total budget allocated to the scheme for 2025 amounted to €54.4 million.",

While I cannot accept the Bill, I want to be clear that my Department is working hard to deliver on the Bill’s core intent in a way that is coherent, system wide and enduring. Our aim is simply that no family in Ireland should ever struggle to meet the costs of sending their child to school.",
                "The review of Circular 0032/2017, the enactment of the Education (Student and Parent Charter) Bill and our measures to provide free schoolbooks, increased capitation for schools and ongoing investment in school transport all form part of a coherent, evidence-based strategy to make education genuinely affordable for all. For that reason, I am asking the House to decline to give this Bill a Second Reading, but I do so while affirming my Department’s total commitment to tackling back to school costs and supporting families in every community in Ireland."

                "I wish to start by saying that I am a strong supporter of schools having uniforms. It takes a lot of pressure off families and it keeps the fashion shows and the competition out of schools. It is a leveller. Every time parents are asked about school uniforms, survey results always say they support a uniform. We are in a cost-of-living crisis and everything is getting more expensive, however. Every September, parents are worrying about the cost of getting their kids back to school. They are using their savings and, in some cases, they are borrowing to ensure costs are covered.",
                "In some schools, we have a situation where there is no competition when it comes to a parent buying a school uniform. We all know the story. Parents get a letter from the school telling them that the uniforms have to come from a specific shop and that no other brand or version is acceptable. That is the case for secondary school uniforms in particular. Parents with a daughter – I am speaking for myself in this instance – have to buy a skirt, blouses, jumpers, PE tracksuit and school coats, which are all branded. This costs big money. The Minister of State will understand that these costs add up for parents who have two or three children in that school. That is before we even talk about schools where students need iPads or tablets.",
                "The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, looked at this earlier in the year and found that three quarters of schools had branded items that could only be bought from a recommended retailer. The Minister of State and I know that leads to higher costs. A simple way to reduce costs for parents is through giving them more choice when it comes to buying school uniforms. We need to switch to generic jumpers and make iron-on or sew-on crests the norm. Back in 2017, the then Minister issued a circular addressing some of these issues, looking for iron-on crests and generic items, etc. I am absolutely surprised to say that the Minister of State is not supporting the Bill that actually details what was said in 2017. Here we are seven years on and nothing has changed and there is still a massive cost on parents buying school uniforms. This Bill we are debating is very clear. Schools needs to have it written down. It needs to be a proper policy."

Think of the parents who are living in overcrowded emergency accommodation. How are they going to wash uniforms? I raise the pressure that is being put on them to get their kids out the door every morning in the proper attire. There are some shops with a monopoly. Parents are paying out vast sums of money when they should have more choice. There should be more flexibility. It should be easy for people to buy uniforms for their children, not putting a barrier of costs in the way. What we are looking to do is to support parents, families and children.",

They are dipping into savings and turning to credit unions just to send their children to school. As we have just heard, they are going to money lenders, unscrupulous ones at that, and getting themselves into huge unsustainable debts. One of the biggest drivers of these costs is school uniforms. In Waterford, parents are telling me the same story each August and September. They are stretched to breaking point. In many schools, families have no real choice when it comes to uniforms. Branded or crested clothing is required, extended even to PE wear and jackets. That includes primary school, driving costs up year after year. This Bill is about tackling that head on. The Bill will place an obligation on the Minister for education to make regulations ensuring every school has an affordable uniform policy, one that recognises the financial pressures facing families. It is about fairness, choice and common sense.",
                "The Irish League of Credit Unions has found that the total back-to-school spend this year rose by €360 for primary, and €170 for secondary students. More than half of parents have gone into debt to meet these costs. It is not just uniforms; it is books, digital devices, transport and the voluntary contributions that are anything but voluntary. I have spoken to parents in my constituency clinics this year who are paying hundreds of euro for a single digital device because their child's school has moved away from textbooks. Families with two or three children simply cannot keep up. Others are paying for fuel or taxis because they are excluded from the school transport scheme - a scheme that is supposed to ensure equal access to education but instead leaves rural families in particular footing the bill for long commutes.",
                "For families of children with disabilities or additional educational needs, these costs are multiplied. Between therapy appointments, sensory equipment and specialist materials, they are already carrying a heavier load. School costs should never add to that burden. All of this is happening against the backdrop of a deepening cost-of-living crisis. Groceries, rent, energy, fuel - everything is going up, while wages and supports fail to keep pace. Families are being pushed to the limit and the Government's response has been piecemeal and reactive. It is the same story in every part of the State. People are working hard and doing their best but are struggling to stay afloat.",
                "Schools are feeling that same pressure. They are being asked to do more with less, to fundraise for basic materials, to rely on voluntary contributions to keep the lights on, to keep toilet paper in the toilets because the so-called increases in capitation funding announced in budget 2026 will not take effect until January. Teachers and principals have been very clear. They have been clear with us, and I have no doubt they have been clear with the Government. They need proper funding now, not next year. Tonight's Bill is a modest but meaningful step. It will not solve every problem, but it will make a real difference to families and parents who are struggling. It would ensure schools adopt uniform policies that are affordable and accessible, policies that treat parents with fairness and respect. Families in Waterford and across the State do not need a Government press release about free education. What they need are decisions that actually lower costs, take the pressure off the kitchen table and make schooling genuinely affordable for all families. The Minister of State indicated the Government will not be supporting this Bill, but supporting it would be a really good place to start."

Barnardos carried out a back-to-school report, noting that 54% of parents are worried about costs, as families dip into savings where they have some, get loans and apply household budget cutbacks to pay for uniforms. The Irish League of Credit Unions report highlights that there is a 5% increase on last year in families that are sacrificing food in order to cover costs. That is an absolute disgrace.",

In my own constituency, a family with both parents working, but with mortgage, food and fuel costs, is still struggling to pay their bills. The added cost of a uniform is even more pressure. When asked about the cost of uniforms, the Minister for education said it was up to schools to offer crests parents could buy and then buy the uniform separately. This is not practical or workable. PE gear adds to the bills. The polo shirt costs €15 when crested, yet a parent can buy a three-pack with no crest for about €8 - the same colour as what the school demands but it just has no crest on it. A mother told me:",

Every family is affected by this, not just the chosen few. However, we stand and debate another topic that has a significant effect on our most vulnerable people in our society. This year's budget is another missed opportunity to show real ambition for Ireland's teachers, children and school communities. It is not enough to make token gestures while ignoring the major issues at the heart of our education system. This is one of those major issues. We should not be in a situation where parents are forced to take out loans, apply for supplementary welfare allowance or for their children to go without. The reality is this is what is happening. These families do not want their sympathy or empathy; they want fair and transparent access to everything that others in our society have.",
                "This Bill leads towards the very basic things that children in this country should have access to - school uniforms. I recognise the role and the pride that schools take in their school uniforms. They are part and parcel of the history and of the fabric of each and every school community. Every parent wants to see their child, no matter how young or old, in their school uniform. I think of my own grandmother's house. There are pictures of all of her children and grandchildren on her wall. Apart from only a few, nearly every picture shows each child in their school uniform.",
                "This is no coincidence. The school uniform is an essential element of school life and has been for many generations in this country. However, with this, we must be progressive in our views on school uniforms. In 2017, the Department of education issued guidelines to schools to reduce uniform costs by encouraging the use of generic uniforms with sew-on crests. Implementation, however, has been inconsistent, with many schools insisting on expensive and branded uniforms. When schools mandate crested or branded items of uniform from exclusive suppliers, costs increase further, thereby undermining the principle of equitable access to education. That is the fundamental issue. We talk about education being the great leveller. How can that be if mothers or fathers cannot afford to go out and purchase a branded jumper or shirt for their children? Where is the equity in that? Where does the great leveller come in there? It does not.",

However, the payment is not universal but is means-tested. I speak for all families when speaking on this topic. No family should be put before a means test to access a payment to help with the very basic, in this instance school uniforms and shoes. In the Labour Party mission is the provision of an inclusive and genuinely free-of-charge system of State-run education. To be totally frank, we can say we created free primary and second level education in this country all we want, but when you step back and analyse it, have we actually? We still have voluntary contributions that are not that voluntary. We have exorbitant school uniform costs. Schools now ask children to have €500 laptops and tablet devices. Many schools are begging parents to partake in fundraisers every year, placing another burden on parents. However, this is not the school's fault because it is often the case that these fundraisers go towards funding for essential day-to-day running costs, new school equipment or even jerseys for their sports teams.",

However, as I said, if you take one step away and analyse this free primary and second level education system, nobody here can say it is free. Education is our greatest tool for creating a more equal and prosperous Ireland and costs should not be a barrier to any child reaching his or her potential. We must ensure that every child has a fair start and we must cut costs for parents by making education genuinely free. That includes the costs I mentioned previously, including the universal back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance and a ban on voluntary contributions. We must also continue working towards increasing our capitation grants not just at primary level but also at post-primary level.",
                "Parents are doing everything they can to give their children the best start in life but they are being failed by a system that continues, as I said, to demand voluntary contributions, to charge for uniforms and exam papers and, increasingly, as has been mentioned, to require expensive digital devices, such as tablets and iPads. This is not free education. Making the clothing and footwear allowance universal would come at a cost of €250 million to the State. It would include €260 for four- to 11-year-olds and €385 for those aged between 12 and 22 years.",
                "Issues such as these are the fundamental issues that create a stigma within our schools. We must ensure we reduce any cause, or get rid of any cause or possible cause, of bullying within any of our school environments. However, we must be real with ourselves. We have all been in schools. The children without are often the ones targeted. School uniforms should not be another target placed on a child's back.",
                "As was mentioned previously, data from the Irish League of Credit Unions revealed in August that parents are now spending over €1,450 per primary pupil and €1,560 for those in secondary school. One in three families are being forced into debt to cope with the financial burden. It is absolutely unacceptable that 35% of parents say they have had to deny their child at least one essential item. This is not just about cost. It is about fairness and dignity for children. No child should be left behind because their family cannot afford the basics.",
                "Along with this, there are other clear actions that the Government could introduce. We could permanently abolish exam fees and we could make school transport free for everyone with a €27 million investment. We could ban voluntary contributions and increase capitation grants by a further 20%. We could also ensure that home economics students get the same ingredients support that exists for woodwork and metalwork. Education should be a right, not a burden. The Labour Party's proposals are constantly practical, costed and achievable.",

SVP has been advocating for the last 15 years for free schoolbooks, so it’s great that this year both secondary and primary schools are both receiving free books. However, we're seeing an increase in people looking for help to buy technology, laptops and tablets. The books are free but now many schools are expecting students to have devices, which is quite a big expense for parents. It's not mandatory to have them, but there's an expectance there, and kids don't want to be the only one in a class without one. We've also seen an increase in people looking for help to buy uniforms. The back-to-school allowance is there, but it's not enough to cover everything. Those are the two main expenses, but SVP is conscious that the school year doesn't stop in September. There are costs associated throughout the year, and we'll get a lot of calls for assistance on those too.",

Some 27% of secondary and 14% of primary school parents across Ireland said they have used savings to meet back-to-school costs, while 15% of secondary and 8% of primary school parents said that they have taken a loan out or borrowed from family or friends.",

                "In August, I read about back-to-school costs for one parent, Ms Claire O'Rourke, who lives in Glasnevin in Dublin. I read about her in The Irish Times. She came up with a figure of about €800 per month for four children. That figure applies every month during the school year. In her article, she included that one of her daughters' schools favoured iPads over schoolbooks. They had to be bought from a particular supplier at a cost of €604. When speaking about school uniforms, she referenced the new PE kit the school has introduced. It cost €117.50 for one child. She went on to speak about exam fees, extracurricular activities, voluntary contributions, school transport and school lunches. These are all what we would consider basic and part and parcel of free education.",
                "Every year, parents contact public representatives about the costs associated with going back to school. One parent told me in August that they would not pay gas or electricity bills in August but would borrow, take out a loan and use instalments to get as much as they can for back-to-school items. They said they would go into debt until March the following year before it was all paid back and the situation would repeat again in August. They said they are worried about whether they can keep it up, year after year.",
                "These are real-life examples. They are particular examples from associations such as Barnardos and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, which are constantly advocating for and meeting families who are coming to them for help. No family should be going into debt, skipping meals or turning off the heating or lighting to cover basic needs such as school uniforms. No child should have to go through the plight of not knowing whether they will have every piece of school uniform every year. I am extremely disappointed. I would normally work with the Department on this, but I am extremely disappointed that the Department has not taken this Bill on board. It is legislation we could all have worked on together. It is disappointing. For the end of my speech, I have written, \"I urge you to support this motion.\" However, there is no point in saying that now because the disappointment is there now. It is felt in the pocket of the people who have to pay for their children to go back to school every year."

                "I researched this issue during my doctoral work and when I worked as a youth worker and in a school completion programme. Uniforms are a huge cause of discomfort for people. The main reasons are that for children and young people with sensory issues, uniforms are often very uncomfortable and are very itchy. They are not practical for girls, in that uniforms might have very long or very short skirts and are not very practical in cold weather and for cycling. However, that is not a reason that if we do have a school uniform that it is not then affordable. I will come to that part and I am not dissing this Sinn Féin Bill at all. I am just saying that uniforms are important for people and if we have them, that is fine but there might be an alternative.",
                "Uniforms cause a huge amount of difficulty for some students because they forget items. The Bill does deal with the fact that we have to have uniforms but there needs to be a practical understanding from schools on how to implement their policies. I often worked with young people with regard to attendance. I worked in the school completion programme where attendance was a big thing. What we would find was that a young person would eventually get to school after being suspended due to behaviour, or after a long absence, only to be told they were wearing the wrong colour shoes, the wrong tie or they forgot this or that. That is ridiculous because the child is sent home to get the proper uniform. Schools need to be practical about this. Yes, uniforms are extremely expensive. Some people might forget them but others may not have them. Where I am coming from, and this is where it speaks to Sinn Féin's Bill, some children and young people do not have the uniforms because they are just so expensive. On that basis, a family cannot afford to replace the tie. The easiest part of the school uniform to get lost is the tie. They do not know where it is. It falls down the back of the radiator or wherever but it is gone. It is expensive to replace it. I do not know why school uniforms need to have a tie in the first place but that is probably a side part of this.",
                "School jumpers, as has been said by many, are very expensive. Students grow out of them, they lose them, they get holes in them, somebody else take them or whatever. Schools have to have a practical way of dealing with this. Having generic uniforms, if they have to have them, is so important.",
                "Recently I had students Clogher Road Community College in. They were doing leaving certificate applied, LCA, work experience with me. I asked them to do a project on what their ideal school would be. They had a long list and one of the things they had on the list was no school uniform. They do not have a uniform in the school they go to but they were both in schools previously where they did have a uniform. They feel much better in themselves not having to wear a school uniform.",
                "My last point on this, before I go back to the substantive part, is I know people argue that if we do not have a school uniform, it can lead to competition as to what clothes students wear. School culture is very important in this. I have been involved in multi-denominational schools for a long time and what I found was that there is no uniform in those schools but there is not that competition and the reason for that is that the students kind of have their own uniforms, which is leggings and a hoodie or jeans or tracksuit bottoms and a hoodie. They fall into what it is and there is not that big competition.",
                "However, this Bill is about the cost of living and supporting families in a situation where it is so expensive to put their children through our free education system. As previous speakers said, this is where the problem is - it is not free. I have mentioned Circular 32/17 several times in the Dáil because I thought I might have imaged that circular came out because nothing ever seems to have happened about it. I was delighted when it came out for the kids we supported in our project. All school completion programmes and all schools working in disadvantaged areas have a bank of uniforms in case somebody forgets something. In our project, Ballymun ansoe school completion programme, we had a washing machine and dryer so we could wash uniforms. We had a stock of uniforms so we could replace them for families who could not afford to replace them themselves. We had the facility to wash and dry uniforms, if that was necessary. Sometimes if a student only has one uniform and if that uniform gets dirty on a Monday in the yard or during sport, it will be dirty for the remainder of the week because he or she does not have a second one. When a uniform is really expensive, it is hard to replace it. If they were generic, it would not be as hard to replace them. Previous speakers said that if the polo shirt is a generic that can be bought anywhere, that is great but if it is an expensive one, a family might have one or might have none.",
                "If we have circulars and there are things set out by the Department that schools are supposed to do and they are not doing them, what is the consequence? What is the point in somebody in the Department of education writing a circular, saying this is what we want the school to do but then it does not happen? What role does the Minister of State have in making sure that happens because this Bill would not have had to have been brought forward if what was set out in the circular was being done? The circular said uniforms should be generic, practical and the costs for families should be reduced as much as possible but yet all we hear this evening is that this is not the case. We have a situation where school uniforms are expensive and families are struggling and coming to the end of August and beginning of September, they are thinking about what they will do if there is not that culture within the school to have swaps when students grow out of things. I think a lot of schools are doing that and getting used to the idea but there are schools that are not because people are contacting us asking us if this can be brought in and asking if anything can be done.",
                "Students have to have uniforms, tablets and books. I am constantly puzzled that they have to have tablets and books. There are exam costs, voluntary contributions, which really are not voluntary in some cases, and other costs associated with going to school such as lunches. I know there are free lunches but not everybody eats the free lunches. If education was truly free, there would not be costs for any of these things.",
                "We have one in five children living in poverty. The reality is that we have the Society of St. Vincent de Paul delivering food and we have food banks. We have families who go to different places to pick up food every single week. Uniforms are the last thing they can deal with or else uniforms are the thing they focus on because they know it is the thing that will draw attention to the student, in that they are different and are not the same as everybody else because they do not have the school uniform or the uniform is dirty. What it means is they buy the school uniform but then they do not have any other clothes because it is either-or. It sounds like we are talking about the 1980s or previous times but we are not. This is 2025 and this is happening for families.",
                "What I and the Social Democrats are saying is that if we want to have free education in this country, which we keep saying we want to have, it will not be free as long as we have these costs that cannot be kept down to a minimum. It is so easy to do that but it needs to be policed. Not only do uniforms need to be affordable but they need to be comfortable and practical. Girls wearing shorts or shirts that are down to their ankles or up to their knees or wherever is not practical. How are they supposed to cycle? They will not cycle in a skirt that goes up to here or is down to their ankles. It is dangerous and they will not feel comfortable in it. How will a transgender child wear a uniform that is assigned to one gender or the other? There has to be flexibility in that.",
                "In regard to having items that are compulsory and items that are not, some schools I have been involved in have had a tracksuit but the tracksuit did not have the iron on crest but rather the crest you have to buy and that is the problem because they are the expensive things.",
                "I thank Sinn Féin for bringing this Bill forward. I echo my colleague from the Labour Party in saying I am disappointed the Government cannot see that this Bill has to be brought forward because what was already set out in that circular is not happening. When the Government implements things, it needs to follow up on them. It is really important. We are trying to make the lives of young people easier and make it easier for them to learn.",
                "In regard to children with additional needs, uniforms need to be practical for those students as well because it is really important they are comfortable and do not have sensory overload from uniforms that are itchy or uncomfortable. I am disappointed the Government will not support this Bill. The Social Democrats will support it.",
                "It is important that any family sending their children to school should not be going to a loan shark, a credit union, a bank or other family members to be able to just have this basic thing, which is being able to send their children to school knowing they are not going to go hungry themselves or that their children will not go hungry, or that the children would be shamed because they do not have the uniform because they cannot afford it. I thank Sinn Féin for bringing this Bill forward."

                "I thank Sinn Féin for bringing forward this very important Bill. I fully support the Bill, which would mandate all schools to adopt a cost-conscious uniform policy. As a parent, I have seen the cost of school uniforms increase massively over the years. It used to be the case that not so long ago we would have been able to buy one or two branded items such as a school jumper or a school tie. Other items such as polo shirts, trousers or shoes could be bought at any shop if they were the right colour. This allowed multiple retail options and allowed parents to shop around for the best value, or even to shop second-hand sometimes. That option is increasingly being taken away as more and more schools introduce expensive branded shirts, track suits, bags, coats and PE gear. Uniforms are supposed to signify unity and equality but now they just mean another additional cost for families when there is a cost-of-living crisis going on. It costs between €40 to €50 for one secondary school jumper now. I have three children that were at high school in the past 18 months and I know for a fact that one jumper per child does not happen. A family is paying for multiple jumpers because they go through them and they do not last a year. It costs hundreds of euro just to put a uniform on them that has to be changed and adapted as winter comes and again as spring comes as children grow. If a family has multiple children, they are paying far more. School uniforms cost an absolute fortune for middle-income earners but for low-income earners it is an entire week's wages that comes out of that family's costs just to put a uniform on their child's back.",
                "A circular published just eight years ago by the then Minister for Education included measures to be adopted by schools to reduce the cost of uniforms and other costs. The circular, which the school authorities were expected to adopt, included the following principles for cost-effective practices: all elements of school uniform should be part purchased from various stores; the iron-on or sew-on crest should be used; whenever possible generic rather than branded items should be specified; parents should be provided with a list of all required items along with the costs of these required items; and the schools should consult with parents on their views and suggestions on the reductions of the costs of these uniforms. The template questionnaire that would address the cost-effective practices should be sent out to parents once every three years. As a parent I have not seen that. The boards of management should review this annually. As a member of a board of management, I have never seen this. It was stated that the schools should implement this circular from September 2017 onwards. Anyone who has school-age children will know that these proposals were not introduced in most schools. In fact, schools seem to be going in the other direction. In recent years more and more schools have turned to expensive branded options under the guise of promoting equality and inclusivity. The reality is that it just causes additional stress to parents and it has resulted in the exclusion of students who in some cases have not been allowed to take part in activities without school-branded clothing. It is a ridiculous situation that students are actually being excluded as a result of a school uniform policy. It completely goes against the intentions of the uniform in the first place. Students are also subject to harsh disciplinary action when not adhering to school uniform policy. The fact is that schools themselves do not seem to be adhering to Circular 0032/2017 regarding school uniforms. One of the key proposals of the school uniform was to create a more focused educational environment and reduce distractions. It completely defeats the purpose when students are penalised for something as small as a white stripe on a pair of shoes or for their tie being tied up the wrong way. This puts focus on the appearance of students and not on their educational environment.",
                "Because school uniform policies have changed so much over the years, in many cases items can no longer be reused or passed down to siblings. This means that parents are forced to buy brand new uniforms all over again with the expense to the family. How are parents expected to cope in a cost-of-living crisis? Back-to-school costs are astronomical. The Irish League of Credit Unions found that one in three parents now say that they get into debt covering their children's school costs when they go back to school in August and September. Over one third of parents say they are forced to deny their child at least one item when going back to school. Instead of two €50 jumpers, it is now one €50 jumper and the student has to make sure that this jumper is as good as new every single day or washed. It now costs on average €1,450 for primary school parents and €1,560 for secondary school parents to send their children to school. Families simply just cannot afford this. They are squeezed from every angle.",
                "On top of this, for families in Donegal and across the country the defective concrete crisis is adding an unbearable cost to this desperate situation when these kids are living in crumbling homes. Their parents are trying to heat these homes and pay their mortgage. They are being squeezed to death and they cannot pay for these uniforms. Many homeowners face impossible decisions while trying to pay their mortgage. What will they do: pay the mortgage in September or put a uniform on their child's back? They are choosing to put the uniform on the child's back and then the banks have the cheek to come and chase them for their house.",
                "Given that the 2017 circular was completely ineffective in addressing this cost of uniform,s it is clear that this Bill is needed to promptly address this issue to support struggling families. I urge the Government to support Sinn Féin's Bill and to address the increase in back-to-school costs for hundreds of thousands of families across Ireland."

This Bill only exists because the Government has failed in the most fundamental of duties to make education genuinely free and fair. We have heard many times that Ministers roll out free books, free books and free books, but parents are still being hit with hidden charges. Many schools today had contacted families earlier this year telling them, or forcing them, to purchase electronic tablets costing up to €600 per child. Let us imagine being the parent hit with that charge in August and September while having the additional cost of €1,400 to €1,600 on a uniform.",

I have met school principals the length and breath of this country who are begging parents simply to keep the lights on in their schools and to pay the insurance costs. The facts are stark. An analysis of 707 schools shows that heating costs are up 83% since 2019, water and refuse bills are up 51%, accounting and auditing costs are up 58% in schools and the cost of management systems is a staggering 199% increase. The average primary school faces a deficit of €17,000 in day-to-day running costs while the Minister of State and Ministers parade around claiming that Irish education is free. That is a falsehood. It is not free. It is a lie that is told by comfortable people to the struggling families of this nation.",

That is not education; that is indoctrination. This is what the Department is doing. Parents did not vote for their children to be used as social experiments. Families in Cork, Mallow, Glanmire, Little Island, and Ballincollig want everything that we had as children growing up. They want the basics done right. They want heat in the classrooms, affordable uniforms and education that is real learning that will put their children in a place where they are available for the jobs of tomorrow. They want their taxes spent on teachers. They do not want it spent on consultants and PR campaigns about inclusivity. What they really want is nothing more than getting the basics right so their children are able to leave school, go on to third level education and secure a future in this country. The Government is drunk on the nectar of self-congratulation while ordinary parents in this country are running on empty.",
                "The truth is the Department of education has lost touch with classrooms. It governs by press release, with parents left in the lurch and left to feel the pain over and over again. Most parents facing the summer holidays are thinking about how they will pay the bills when schools return in August and September and what other hidden charges there might be. I support the Bill not as a gesture but as a rebuke to the Government. It takes the Opposition to remind it that the Minister for Education and Youth and her Department should serve families, not lecture them."

According to Barnardos, back-to-school costs now average €725 for primary school pupils and €1,100 for secondary school. That is not just a statistic; it is a crisis. Families are dipping into savings, taking out loans and making impossible choices just to send their children to school. The Bill is a practical response to that reality. It requires schools to keep uniforms simple and affordable, allow parents to shop around and not be tied to one expensive supplier, offer second-hand options and show compassion when families are struggling. We must stop punishing families for sending their children to school. The cost of uniforms should never be a barrier to education. The Bill puts fairness first and helps to make school more equal for every child.",
                "We also must discuss voluntary contributions, which are, in fact, anything but voluntary for many families. Despite increased capitation funding, schools are still relying on these contributions to cover basic costs such as classroom materials, IT upgrades and extracurricular activities. Some parents are being asked for anything from €140 up to €550 per child, with 80% saying those requests do not feel optional. Schools, too, are under pressure, with the funding they receive often not stretching far enough. However, we cannot allow that gap to be filled by guilt-tripping of parents. No child should be excluded, embarrassed or disadvantaged because his or family cannot afford a voluntary payment. Capitation rates must be increased further, a code of practice should be introduced for voluntary funds and we must ensure transparency and fairness in how schools communicate with families.",

We in Independent Ireland believe in expanding modular training programmes, increasing SOLAS and ETB capacity regionally and offering incentives for completion, including local placement guarantees. This is especially urgent when we consider the cost-of-living crisis and the heartbreaking number of children and parents experiencing homelessness.

The more simple we keep uniforms and the whole back-to-school experience, the cheaper it will become for families. In Mayo, as throughout the country, families are struggling. September brings significant financial fear due to all the costs associated with going back to school, including the cost of uniforms, shoes, warm coats, schoolbooks and, increasingly, IT equipment. I spoke to a family recently who spent almost €1,500 on a tablet for their child entering first year. That is an incredible amount for this family to have to find. It is a very challenging situation for parents. School transport is another big factor. Likewise, the not so voluntary school contribution is causing great difficulty for families. It is causing difficulty for principals as well as they are forced, in effect, into becoming debt collectors. It is totally unacceptable.",
                "The back to school clothing and footwear allowance is welcome and positive. However, it appears the Minister is rejecting this Bill on the basis of citing that provision. This is totally unacceptable. The allowance often gets diverted into food, heating and all those other costs. The Bill reduces the cost of going back to school. Who could be against such a measure? In some cases, parents are told they must, for example, buy a branded jumper, shirt and skirt. The branded nature of such clothing, which may include embroidery, means it may be double the cost of non-branded items. A jumper that might cost €20 instead costs €60 or €70, which is totally unreasonable and unfair.",
                "The Bill is a positive measure. Clear labelling, for instance, is a positive measure. Often, students will come home and tell their parents they need a particular jumper. It is a good thing to ensure parents know what is mandatory and what is optional. Minimal use of branded items is another positive measure. Crested jumpers are typically more expensive than non-crested ones. Reducing the exclusive nature of uniforms will allow a greater number of providers and suppliers into the marketplace. I spoke to many families last September who were, in effect, forced to purchase uniforms from one or two suppliers. Competition is a good thing. The Bill will promote competition in the market and reduce costs for struggling families.",

That is double the European norm. Would it not be a great thing if schools were front and centre in promoting the use of second-hand clothing, hand-me-downs and reusable items? When I lived in America a number of years ago, I found the concept of the thrift shop to be a great thing. Many of my American friends would talk about the great deals they got in a thrift store. Assisting schools to promote reusing uniforms is a positive measure. Of course, it can only really happen if we enable a greater use of generic uniforms. That is the key. Regional towns with a number of schools would see a movement of uniforms across those schools. That would be a positive development.",

                "The Minister again thanks Deputies O'Rourke, Clarke and Ó Laoghaire for bringing forward this Bill and for giving the House an opportunity to debate an issue that affects many families in the country. The Deputies' concern for affordability in education is both genuine and shared across this Chamber. We may differ on the mechanisms, but not on the principle. Every child deserves to go to school without cost being a barrier and no parent should feel financial pressure simply because they want to give their child the best start.",
                "I recognise, as the Deputies do, that the start of each school year can bring financial strain. School-related costs tend to arrive at once and for many families, that creates real pressure. That is precisely why the Government has made affordability a cornerstone of our education policy and why we have already taken major, practical steps to address the very issues raised in this Bill. Our approach has been to implement comprehensively instead of in a piecemeal way, to support families in a sustainable way and to embed affordability across the education system. Through the review and strengthening of Circular 0032/2017, which relates to back to school costs and includes school uniform costs, we are ensuring schools adopt effective measures to make school uniforms affordable, from using generic, widely available items to promoting swap shops and removing exclusive supplier arrangements. This is a key action in the education plan 2025. Crucially, we are doing this in partnership with parents and students. The working group, established by the Department of Education and Youth to review the circular, includes representatives from the National Parents Council and other education partners. It will engage directly with families and young people to hear their views on how best to reduce the back to school costs.",
                "The Government believes that the best policies are built with communities, not simply imposed on them. We believe that our approach acknowledges the responsibilities of all people in our children's lives, parents and school staff alike, to support the quality of their teaching and learning in schools. It also acknowledges our responsibility as a Government to support our school communities in working together in the best interests of children and young people. That is why the Minister, Deputy McEntee, intends to progress the Education (Student and Parent Charter) Bill 2019, which will, for the first time, make it a statutory duty for every school to consult with parents and students on all key policies and activities, not just on school uniforms. The charter Bill aims to embed transparency and respect among all members of school communities. It will make clear that parents and students are not passive recipients of decisions but genuine partners in shaping them. The Bill will also replace section 28 of the Education Act 1998 with a new section 28. Working with other provisions of the Bill, this amendment will ensure that all schools will be required to have, and implement, standardised complaints procedures for parental complaints and complaints from pupils and students.",
                "The charter guidelines, which will be developed in consultation with education stakeholders, will set out the details of the grievance procedures. These will focus on dealing with complaints efficiently, effectively and, insofar as possible, informally. The overall approach of the charter Bill is to move away from reacting to problems in schools after they arise to an early intervention approach that aims to improve the day-to-day experience students and their parents can expect from schools. In doing so, it is envisaged that the number of complaints in schools should reduce. We are not stopping there.",
                "Uniforms are just one element of the overall cost of schooling. That is why our response has been, and will continue to be, comprehensive. From September of this year, every child and young person in the free education scheme - almost 1,000,000 students - will receive free school books and core classroom material. This is an investment of €170 million per year. It represents the full delivery of a major programme for Government commitment. Families will no longer be asked to buy books or pay book rental fees. Schools will handle provision directly, ensuring every euro is spent efficiently and effectively. This is one of the most significant cost reduction measures every introduced in Irish education.",
                "We are also giving schools the means to manage their own costs more sustainably. In budget 2026, the Department of Education and Youth secured €39 million in additional capitation funding for schools. This includes an increase of €50 per pupil at primary level, an increase of €20 per student at post-primary level and enhanced supports for DEIS and special schools. These are substantial increases. Capitation funding has increased almost 50% at primary level and 28% at post-primary level over the past three budgets. This ensures schools can cover essential running costs. We have also ensured the cost of getting to school remains manageable. An extra €69 million in budget 2026 has been allocated to meet rising demand and transport costs. We have seen a particular increase in demand for school transport for pupils with special educational needs and we are delighted to be able to offer this service for free to these students.",
                "In addition, €58 million in cost of living supports for 2025 allowed us to continue the reduced transport fees introduced in recent years for children and young people accessing the mainstream transport service. As a result, families are benefiting from the following fees in this school year: €50 per primary pupil; €75 per post-primary pupil; and a family cap of €125. These measures have made a tangible difference in easing the back-to-chool costs and ensuring access to education is not limited by geography or income. The hot school meals scheme is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance. It provides free, nutritious meals to children during the school day. It helps families reduce the cost of school-related expenses while also supporting children's health and learning. The hot school meals scheme was extended to all primary schools during 2025. This means that in total, 3,200 schools and 550,000 children are now eligible for the hot school meals scheme.",
                "The Government's position is clear and grounded in evidence. We are not opposing this Bill because we disagree with its goals; we are doing so because these goals are being achieved in a more integrated and effective way. We are addressing back to school costs at every level through updated guidance for schools and school uniforms, direct engagement with parents and students, free school books, enhanced capitation and affordable transport. We are doing so as part of a coherent policy framework that promotes equality, sustainability and fairness across our entire education system.",
                "In closing, I again thank the Deputies for their commitment to this issue and for the constructive debate we have had. Their concern reflects the concerns of families right across Ireland and those are concerns I share deeply. However, I believe the path we are on through sustained investment, meaningful consultation and evidence-based reform is the right one. It is delivering results and it will continue to do so. The review of Circular 0032/2017, the enactment of the Education (Student and Parent Charter) Bill 2019 and our broad package of cost reduction measures together form a coherent, joined-up strategy to make education genuinely affordable for all. For that reason, while I respectfully ask the House to decline to give this Bill a Second Stage reading, I do so with a firm commitment that this Government will continue to act decisively, compassionately and in partnership with parents, students and schools so that no family in Ireland will have to struggle to meet the cost of sending their children to school."

                "The Minister has taken a disappointing approach. Back in 2011, I recall discussing the affordability of school uniforms in this House with Ruairi Quinn, the then Minister for Education and Skills. Unfortunately, at that time, we failed to convince him and probably more importantly, the officials at that time this was the way forward. If we cast our minds back to that period, we were in the middle of an economic crash. Families were finding it extremely difficult to try to pay for school uniforms. Despite the positive reforms that the Minister of State has outlined relating to school books etc., when I talk to them, families, and particularly poor families, are finding it almost impossible to try to pay for these school uniforms.",
                "We all know the stories of the debt collectors and money lenders. This particular time of the year is probably the worst time for families. With Christmas coming up, this is the time when they go to the money lenders. It also happens in July and August when their children are going back to school. The debate I had with Ruairí Quinn at that time was on the cost of education. The Minister of State has outlined certain reforms that have been initiated. I do not think he is trying to tell us that it is not expensive for families to put their children through the education system. I do not think he is trying to say that here tonight. However, what we are trying to do tonight with this reform is bring a bit of reality into the room. I accept that the cost of school uniforms does not affect everyone. One of the arguments made in 2011 was that there was no demand at the time from some elements. However, some elements can actually afford to do it but others cannot. That is the point we are making. One of the speakers here tonight was talking about some of the initiatives in certain communities in relation to what is happening. The approach taken by the Minister is disappointing. It seems we have not learned from the past number of years. It is really disappointing."

                "In most primary and post-primary schools, school uniforms are mandatory. School uniform policy is generally decided by each individual school's board of management. Increasingly, the cost of uniforms has become a significant concern for many families. This proposed legislation addresses these concerns and outlines a number of ways for schools to offer more cost-effective options for parents.",
                "While we are being critical of their cost, we accept that school uniforms can have beneficial effects. They can promote a sense of pride, self-confidence and a feeling of belonging. They can contribute positively to a student's overall well-being. There is a belief among many teachers that school uniforms can help to prevent bullying as well. School uniforms also offer a practical and convenient solution to parents because they make the decision on what to wear going to school an easy one. It eliminates socioeconomic distinctions among students and removes the possibility of students being discriminated against based on their clothing. However, the cost of a child's uniform can quickly add up, especially if they are required to have a blazer, a tracksuit and other PE gear. Most likely the school uniform will have the school crest on the blazer or jumper. The cost of school uniforms can vary between schools but the average cost for a school uniform in Ireland is around €119 for primary schools and €211 for secondary schools. Additionally, parents can also spend on average around €100 on PE items. This can prove costly if a family is struggling financially. It will definitely be a financial burden on parents who have to buy school uniforms for a number of children.",
                "Some reports have indicated that the total spend on school uniform items can be around €300. Although the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance offers some assistance to hard-pressed families, it falls short of the actual costs the family will incur. The CCPC has made a number of recommendations to help to reduce the costs for parents. The most obvious of these recommendations, which are reflected in this Bill, involves the use of generic uniforms with iron-on or sew-on crests. The implementation of these recommendations has not been consistent. Many schools expect parents to buy branded uniforms which can only be bought at certain shops. Such non-competitive arrangements restrict choice for parents and can lead to higher prices. This Bill aims to take the stress out of buying school uniforms by giving parents a choice as to where to buy uniforms and deliver good value, especially during this cost-of-living crisis."

It is a very aptly called the Education (Affordable School Uniforms) Bill 2025. During the ongoing cost-of-living crisis, the cost of school uniforms has become a huge financial burden on families. The average cost of a full school kit, including gym gear, can be up to €420 per pupil. If there are three siblings, the cost becomes €1,260.",
                "According to the ESRI, as a result of the recent budget the overall earnings of average workers will go down by 2%. Food and grocery prices have risen by 27% between 2021 and 2025. Property tax has gone up by 23% since 2021. Fuel, home heating and electricity bills are the highest in Europe. There is a double cost attached to these uniforms because, as sure as night follows day, voluntary contributions will also have to increase. In fact, the Irish League of Credit Unions has found that almost 80% of schools rely totally on this surcharge. We know that schools throughout the country have a uniform policy that mandates parents to purchase specific design-crested uniforms, including gym wear and jackets. More often than not, the provider of these uniforms is a single entity with a sole contract cutting out any form of competition or any chance of reduction on the items, which means that uniforms will increase in cost each year.",
                "Sinn Féin's affordable uniforms Bill would go a long way to help families and guardians to reduce the cost of school uniforms, and particularly to help large families to cope with this expense in their children's education. The Government amendment is an affront to parents and families throughout our country. The Government said eight years ago, in 2017, that it was going to review a circular and establish a working group, including representatives from the National Parents Council and educational partners. Not one thing has been done in the past eight years to alleviate the exponentially increasing cost of school uniforms. The answer is already under the Minister's nose. He should simply agree to pass Deputy O'Rourke's Bill, and stop wasting time with reviews and bogus amendments."

                "I thank everyone who contributed to the debate. Deputy Mythen put his finger on it when he said that the Government amendment is an elaborate way to kill the Bill, essentially. It refers to consultation, collaboration, engagement and further review, but the substance of the issue is this: what difference is the Government's approach going to make to parents sending kids to school next September? Zero. None. It will be of no benefit to them at all. If the Government enacted the Sinn Féin legislation, it would make a real difference to the lives of people and certainly the financial position of families across the State. The Government wants to review a circular that people working in the sector have said has not made a blind bit of difference. Rather than being reviewed, it should go straight into the bin. That is the reality of it. The Government wants to throw everything into the Education (Student and Parent Charter) Bill. When will that Bill actually come into effect? We are talking about an extended period after that before policies are developed. The cost-of-living crisis is now. We are living through it. We want urgent action from the Government to respond to it. What we are getting instead is consultation and engagement. I do not know about the language the two Ministers of State used when they said they do not want to tell schools what to do. That is exactly what we need to do, in a collaborative way for sure. An affordable school uniform policy needs to be developed, after thinking about this in a detailed way, and needs to be put in place in black and white. That is a reasonable ask and I think it would be met with a reasonable response from schools. It would make a huge difference to families across the State next September. The approach the Ministers of State have come here with - I do not know whether it comes from themselves, from the Department or from other Ministers - is the same type of mentality that has not made a blind bit of difference up to now. It did not make a difference in 2011, as Deputy Crowe said, or in 2017 when the circular was being drafted. The CCPC, Barnardos, the Irish League of Credit Unions and all of the poverty stakeholders say that not enough is being done. The Government's response tonight is wholly inadequate."

The access and inclusion model, or AIM as we know it, provided by that Department enables the full inclusion and meaningful participation of children with disabilities or additional needs in the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme. Its goal is to create a more inclusive environment in preschools so that all children availing of preschool regardless of ability can benefit from quality early learning and care. This is in keeping with general policy position of supporting children with additional needs to access supports and services with their peers and siblings in their local community.",

It is important to note that a diagnosis is not required to access AIM supports and that while some children require additional supports at preschool level, many will transition into mainstream classes thereafter. To further supplement the provision of services for these children, my Department also provides a number of early intervention classes in mainstream and special school settings for children aged between three to five years with a diagnosis of autism. There is also a small number dedicated to children who are deaf or hard-of-hearing.",

The vast majority of young children with additional needs are therefore supported to attend their local early childhood care and education, ECCE, setting and do not need to attend a primary school or special school to access early years support. A professional recommendation for a placement in such a class is also a requirement. Where the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, identifies a need for an early intervention class, the class is sanctioned and supports are provided by my Department to ensure the school can accommodate the class.",

The NCSE is currently examining the level of need by special class and special school type and where these places are best located, including for early intervention classes. For this year alone, there have been three new classes opened and this is responding to the need that has been identified."

To give context - the Deputy will forgive me but I believe my figures from the Minister for children are right - approximately 96% plus of young children between the ages of three and five are accessing the ECCE scheme. Those children, without having to do any means test or assessment, are able to avail of the AIM scheme as well. That leaves fewer than 4% of young children who perhaps are not accessing ECCE and who perhaps for different reasons are not getting or are not able to avail of the level of support they need. That is where the early intervention classes work really well. I have been in some of the classes local to me and I can see how beneficial they are.",

Again, they are to supplement where the ECCE and AIM schemes are perhaps not providing enough support or are not adequate for those young children for whatever reasons. It is really important particularly at that age where for young children, it is play-based learning. It is not that we want children in school from the age of three; it is that we are trying to support as many young children as possible in the early education years. However, where it is not working, that is where I am absolutely confident and clear that the early intervention classes are supporting those children and are very necessary."

The new timeline and the new structure we have put in place will look not just at the demand for a special class place or special school place but also at the potential demand for the early intervention classes. The 1 October deadline has passed and the Minister of State, Deputy Moynihan, and I are working with the NCSE every week and are meeting on a regular basis to look at the overall demand that is there. We are not going to lock anybody out and it is really important to say that. We have a deadline there for a very clear reason, which is to make sure we and, in particular, the NCSE are able to plan ahead but of course we want to work with parents. While we are still working with and managing the data, we are getting a much clearer picture of what the demand is. Last year there was not a requirement for children to have presented to the NCSE by a certain date, which was in February, to get access to a class but it is now a requirement. Children who would earlier on in the year have been unknown to the NCSE are now known, and so we are getting a much clearer picture of what the demand and need is. That will include the overall demand and need for the early intervention classes."

The DEIS programme is a key policy of Government to tackle concentrated educational disadvantage at school level and it is important to acknowledge the success it has been over recent years. More than €180 million is provided annually to additional supports for almost 1,200 schools in the DEIS programme. Budget 2026 allocates an additional €16 million this year on top of that which will translate into €48 million in additional money for the next full year to support the implementation of a new DEIS strategy but also to introduce the new DEIS plus scheme which will start next year.",

Part of delivering this objective will be the introduction of the new DEIS plus scheme. This scheme will provide additional resources to schools with the very highest level of need. To inform the development of the DEIS plus scheme, I have established a design advisory group. On that group, we have quite a number of different people, including principals, home school community liaison teams, school completion programme co-ordinators - people who work with students day in, day out and understand and know the need that is there - individuals from my Department and teams working with young people from across areas where there is high intergenerational disadvantage. We are also intensifying our engagement with other Government Departments and agencies, whether education partners or stakeholders across the education sector to develop the DEIS plus scheme.",

What we are doing at the moment is essentially looking at what the different measures that have been identified are, where the greatest level of need is, what we could introduce in the earlier stages and how can we grow on that. Obviously €16 million is not going to provide us with the full DEIS plus scheme we will inevitably end up with. However, we will start to introduce certain elements of that scheme next year and build on it. What we are working on at the moment is identifying what will provide the greatest level of support at the earliest stages possible and on how we can build on that and develop the best scheme possible."

In relation to the €16 million grant funding, that will not be the full amount to roll out DEIS plus in totality but is it the job of the design advisory group to come up with the specific schools or areas we were going to target first? If so, how do we pick those schools or areas? The Minister knows I am absolutely willing to work with her. At the centre of this is the most disadvantaged children across the country and the Minister will appreciate that the questions that are forthcoming constantly in relation to this are genuinely based on the need for extra supports in our communities."

The coiste Gaeilge in its last term produced a report with many recommendations. We can bring back foundation level at junior cycle, allow an oral-only option for students who struggle with reading and writing, give teachers time and resources to differentiate properly in class and address the reality that additional learning support classes are being timetabled at the same time as Gaeilge, which is another example of Gaeilge being less than.

I speak to principals all the time. What is the Minister doing to recruit those teachers? I believe the Minister should be incentivising those teachers by outlining to them that we will recognise their service in the UAE and provide some increment benefit on the pay scale."

That was one of the first asks that I had. It was one of the first things that I did and I have said that I will do more.",

I have provided more upskilling programmes. Where teachers currently are proficient in two subjects, they are now able to upskill free of charge in certain areas and in particular subjects where there are difficulties such as physics, chemistry or science subjects overall, maths, computing and other areas where we have identified a particular shortage. Likewise, reflecting the previous question about the Gaelscoileanna and Gaelcholáistí, there is work under way to support teachers in making sure that they can upskill and become more proficient so that we do not have such a shortage. However, I appreciate that is a challenge and we are looking at lots of ways in which we can support teachers.",

Many of them are spending that time away and want to travel and to experience other jurisdictions, but they are also coming home because they want to come home and they want to teach in our schools."

The two-year master's, it seems, is here for good. There are teachers across the UAE who have been there five, ten or 15 years and if they return to Ireland, they will start on the lowest point of the pay scale. Those are key items that the Minister could take to address and it would go some way in alleviating the teacher shortage. The shortage is there and these are practical measures the Minister could take."

Dunshaughlin is an area that has seen significant growth. It will continue to see that growth, thankfully, in the years head.",
                    "Under the NDP, my Department's approach will be to continue to maximise the capacity of the existing school estate as much as possible in the first instance while, of course, providing the necessary additional capacity through targeted and prioritised project roll-out over the course of the period 2026 to 2030 to meet the most urgent and prioritised needs.",

This is not something that always happens but, unfortunately, in this instance, it did. The letter of intent then issued to the third tenderer on 15 August - only in the past few months - and subsequent discussions regarding reserved specialist contractors are almost concluded.",

My Department will continue to keep the school authorities informed with regard to getting construction commenced on this urgently required project. I hope we will be able to make progress in the very near future. We are coming towards the end of that current stage. It is again important to stress, and I think the community realises this, that there were a number more recently, in terms of the tender. The fact that contractors withdrew meant the timelines that had been set were, unfortunately, delayed. However, we are still on track to be able to start this project as soon as possible."

There will be a need for additional prefab space in both of these schools come next September because pupils will not be in them. We can all agree to that due to the fact we have not got contracts signed. From speaking to people very close to not only this project, but other projects, and colleagues around the country, there is a concern about capital projects in the education sector. I have spoken to contractors who say it is not easy dealing with the Department; that there have been changes in the Department; that projects are being delayed related to that; and that there were flexibilities and co-operations that were custom and practice, which are not happening now. This is a major concern, not only in Dunshaughlin but across the State. Other Deputies will have questions later on school building projects. Is this recognised by the Minister and the Department?

                    "The whole objective of this survey is for the Department, for the first time, to get a clear understanding of what it is that parents want in education provision for their children. The curriculum is the same and is taught the same irrespective of what school they are in, but for all of the other areas I mentioned, we have not ever had a survey of this kind where we are surveying parents of over 800,000 young people. It is important we get that information.",
                    "To give some context, the number of young people in co-educational schools is at 90%. Only 10% are same-sex schools, so that question perhaps only applies to a smaller number of people. The number of young people in our schools who are being taught through the medium of Irish is at 8%, so 92% are being taught through the medium of English. Do we want to see a greater increase or level of provision for our Gaelscoileanna? That will, hopefully, support and complement the two new strategies I am launching later this week. In relation to patronage, 95% of our schools have a religious ethos. The majority are Catholic in ethos, others are Church of Ireland, there are a small number of other schools and 5% are multi-denominational. Do we have a desire and demand from parents to provide more diverse opportunities for different types of patronages?",
                    "It is very important that as many people as possible take this survey. I encourage, within the Deputy's constituency and others, parents and guardians to take this survey so we get a clearer picture. While there are not the same percentages for post-primary schools - it is about 50:50 at the moment on patronage between multidenominational and denominational - there is potentially an opportunity after this survey to see whether there is demand in certain areas, where there is maybe a more skewed percentage, to do something similar or to ask those questions of parents as well."

People there live in the Cabra-Glasnevin electoral area but are in the Finglas school area. For our Dublin 7 neighbourhoods, only 40% of the children living in the area attend local schools because the geographical area is not prioritised enough in school admission policies. There simply is not enough choice, which is driving students further afield.

As I have mentioned previously, on the allowances for special schools, they may have 70 staff but the allowances for principals are based on how many teachers they have, whereas special school could have 70 staff made up of SNAs, escorts, cleaning staff and caretakers. They obviously then do not get those allowances. One of the suggestions coming from our principals is the introduction of an AP1 for special schools because that would help manage all the staffing. If such a school had 70 teachers, it would have a huge staffing team to manage that but special schools do not have that and they really need it."

Many schools use adjacent local community facilities and we encourage the dual use of different facilities that are close to each other. The provision of outdoor play areas forms part of the accommodation brief for all new school buildings or where a major building or refurbishment project is being delivered for an existing school. Co-operation between schools and the local sporting organisations in sharing their sporting facilities provides opportunity to apply for sport grants including the sports capital grants administered by the Department of Culture, Communications and Sport.

In July, the Government announced a capital allocation of €7.55 billion for the Department of Education and Youth for the period 2026 to 2030. As others also will, I will publish an implementation plan in that regard. My Department’s plan will optimise outputs from the allocations with a strong focus on maximising existing school capacity, progressing priority projects where local capacity across schools in the area is insufficient, and ensuring delivery that is affordable, offers value for money and meets functional needs. In terms of providing further funding for the outdoor spaces, we are investing to support curricular delivery and well-being across schools by prioritising the development of PE halls and sporting facilities in conjunction with the sports capital fund to deliver for both schools and communities.",

We all recognise the importance of play facilities and the important role that plays in a rounded education for any child. The danger is that if it is not managed on an ongoing basis and, more importantly, if the schools do not have the resources to do it on an ongoing basis small things get left undone, they get worse and they get dangerous. No playground should end up unusable because of dangerous facilities and that stitch in time does indeed save nine.

If a number of schools are asking for emergency works grants or minor works grants where they have a playground, a play facility or sports facility that is unusable, how does the Department prioritise one school over another? What can schools do to ensure they are on that list? We all recognise the importance of these facilities. I do not say this as a criticism but schools are put to the pin of their collar in terms of the resources that are available to them. They are being pulled every way. Particularly for schools in areas like my constituency, there is a danger that there might be feeling that there could be voluntary contributions that could assist schools in paying for things when the reality is they do not necessarily have access to resources that other schools do not have as well. I am concerned about the prioritisation of schools and whether there is a view that some schools do not need it which is not the case."

More will apply for the summer works scheme than will get funding, so it is a matter of determining where the need is most acute and how to prioritise that. There is a system and structure within the Department, but where there is a danger to children or where there is playground equipment that cannot be used or a level of resources which means an area is unfit for children, that certainly must be taken into consideration.",

The intention is to work through the various applications as quickly as possible. The good thing about the emergency works and minor works schemes is that you do not have to apply at a particular time; you can apply as needed because, when an emergency arises, you have to be able to respond quickly. The Department tries to respond to individual applications as quickly as possible. I am happy to work with the Deputy on the school he mentioned."

However, the standard allocation can be increased on the basis of the profile and needs of the students enrolled. St. Gabriel’s Special School currently has an enrolment of 54 students and a standard allocation of nine teachers and 18 SNAs. Additional resources, namely one teacher and 17 SNAs, supplementing the standard allocation, have been provided to the school. This is a significant increase in additional resources. The NCSE is providing advice and guidance to the school on how best to deploy staff to support the needs of the children. The Department and the NCSE also provide ongoing training opportunities to schools, particularly special schools, in order that their staff have the skills and competencies required for the level of complexity in the school environment.",

This will mean we will have over 46,500 teachers and SNAs working in our education system. Any school, special or mainstream, with concerns regarding the level of resources to meet the care needs of its students can contact the NCSE at any stage to seek a review of its allocation. I am aware of the issues raised earlier in the year, and we are in constant contact with the school authorities in relation to them."

Since 2020, my Department has invested more than €6 billion in our schools throughout the country under the national development plan. As I mentioned earlier, this involves the completion of over 1,300 school building projects. Given the fact that there are 4,000 schools across the country, the delivery of 1,300 school projects over the last number of years is a significant achievement.",
                    "In July, the Government announced a capital allocation of €7.55 billion for the Department of Education and Youth out to 2030 under the national development plan. As part of this allocation, my Department will place a strong emphasis on a number of things, including the provision of special education for children and the development of new special schools. It is about making sure that our new builds have provisions for special education but also, on top of that, that there is additional accommodation within that where we need to provide special classes within mainstream schools that currently do not have them. There will be a particular focus on meeting annual school place needs. Where there is a growth in demographics, it is important that we be able to respond to that, whether it be a new building that is needed or an expansion of a current school place. For those schools not in permanent buildings, such as those in my constituency or the schools referenced earlier that are in temporary or modular accommodation, we need to ensure we are able to deliver new schools for those communities as quickly as possible.",
                    "Over 300 school building projects, including 38 new schools, are currently in construction to deliver more than 30,000 school places. Most of these projects are expected to be completed over the course of 2026 and 2027. On top of that, it is planned that approximately 80 further school building projects will progress to construction across 2026 and 2027 as part of a two-year rolling programme.",
                    "Project delivery is managed as part of an overall capital programme in line with the Government's infrastructure guidelines. Of course, we always have to take budgetary parameters into account. We do not have an infinite amount of money, so we have to make sure that the projects we have in the system are moving and we are able to progress and deliver them within the budget we have. It is fair to say that delays can happen for certain reasons and different factors, often beyond the Department’s control, such as site acquisition and planning permissions. Often, we have issues, as we have seen, with tenders or contractors. Sometimes, these are issues the Department cannot mitigate, but it obviously adds to some of the delays we see in some of the projects."

They had a consultation over several years, which the Department of education in Tullamore oversaw. There is huge support for an amalgamation of those two schools. The primary schools in Claremorris have recently amalgamated. The patrons of Mount St. Michael Secondary School and St. Colman’s College are supportive, as are parents, school management and the chamber of commerce. There is a huge level of support for it. However, the Department issued notice to the schools a number of months ago outlining the criteria the Minister outlined a few moments ago, basically stating that it would not be supporting it in any sense in terms of capital infrastructure. I ask the Minister to consider that report, the demand and the choice that I know the Minister is very keen to support. I ask her-----"

The first form is an application for benefits, which is returned to the pensions unit of my Department for the processing of the application. The second form relates to the member’s medical condition and must be signed by the member and his or her doctor. The doctor must provide a confidential doctor-to-doctor report to accompany the form detailing the member’s diagnosis, treatment and prognosis.

That applies not just to teachers but to SNAs and other specific non-teaching staff to assess whether they are medically fit for work. It incorporates pre-employment health assessments, it looks at sickness, absent referrals, assessments of medical fitness for work, ill-health retirement assessments and it considers whether a teacher is permanently unfit to teach. There are a number of criteria that it has to take into consideration, including the presence of a disabling illness, the prospect of future improvement or recovery, permanent and total disability, restricted functional capacity, treatment options fully explored and various other elements. While a person may apply and be successful in one instance, that is not to say that he or she cannot apply on the basis that circumstances change.

Today, we have just published a survey specifically looking at primary schools. It was really important that one of the questions in it was whether parents wanted their child or children to be taught through the medium of Irish or English. Also important in the survey is that it is school-specific. While there might be a view that we could have made it more open-ended, making sure that it is school-specific means it can be implemented at the end of the day. If there is a very clear demand within a community for a particular school to change, it makes it easier for that community to engage with the patron to engage with the patron to bring about change.",

Officials in my Department have drawn on the insights gained from this overall consultation process and from research undertaken in developing the new policy. Importantly, the new Gaeltacht policy, which was introduced a number of years ago, has been hugely successful. That was developed using the same approach that has been taken for the two new strategies, including where Irish is taught in English-medium schools and in Gaelscoileanna and Gaelcholáistí. The information from the consultation is being considered in light of extensive provision for Irish-medium education, the estimated demand in the education system, as well as issues relating to teacher supply and the Department’s budgetary and legislative context.",

An issue I have raised with the Minister before, specifically in relation to a secondary school in Cherrywood in my constituency, is the way in which plebiscites are conducted and how the Department chooses whether there will be education through the medium of the Irish language. The community that wants Irish-language education is naturally and necessarily going to be more widely spread. The danger is that the metric the Department currently uses only focuses on a narrow geographic area when, in fact, in the case of Cherrywood, with big transport links like the Luas and buses, children can travel to a Gaelcholáiste from households in a much wider geographic area. Will the survey account for that? Will the Minister ensure that parents from a wide area get the opportunity to make that choice as well?"

The task force that is due to be established under the policy is looking to explore issues relating to the various models of Irish-medium education provision. That does not just mean the development of new schools. We have other areas and ways in which the Irish language is being provided. How do we look at best practice where it has worked well? We may need to develop and reconceptualise the current models of provision, if necessary, with a view to identifying ways to increase the provision of Irish-medium education.",
                    "The short answer is \"Yes\". We want to make sure that the strategy and the work of the task force identify ways in which we can provide options for students, whether through new schools or the reconfiguration of schools, through an aonad, how they have worked, how we can develop that and how can we make them work better in certain areas. However, I think we need to ensure that we have a focused strategy and plan in place with the support of everybody involved. I was pleased to find at recent meetings with the various different bodies that everybody is keen to get working and focus on how we can supply more and better provision for students."

It was told in February that it would hear within six weeks from the technical team in the Department. Over nine months later, it has yet to hear despite frequent correspondence from me. I have also raised the matter with the Taoiseach. The school has raised it repeatedly with officials in the Department but its representatives are still none the wiser. The school is at capacity. It proves the point made earlier by Deputy Barry Ward about the need for Irish-medium education and the huge demand. The school is having to turn children away."

We will continue to prioritise and deliver extra spaces in our mainstream schools through the construction of new schools and extensions.",

A request to purchase additional lands was submitted by the school in 2021 and the acquisition of a 2.765-acre site adjacent to the school was completed at the end of May 2025. In late 2024, the school in question submitted a revised ASA application for additional accommodation to meet its future needs.",

A strong focus will be on maximising existing school capacity, progressing priority projects where local capacity across schools in the area is insufficient, and ensuring delivery that is affordable, offers value for money and meets functional needs. The provision of required school places, including for children with additional educational needs, is a priority for all of us in the Department.",

I do not know if we are talking about the same school. This land was purchased. The purchase was completed. I was a councillor at the time and facilitated it. It was purchased by Waterford City and County Council, as a local agent, on behalf of the Department. It was a really good scheme and I welcomed it at the time I was involved. That land is there. Talking about the demographic, the analysis and all that is, to be quite frank, rubbish.

A key part of our plan is to support schools through investment in digital technologies, in training and teacher professional development and, of course, in curriculum reform.",
                    "The digital strategy for schools to 2027 and its associated implementation plan are underpinned by €200 million in funding. That is over the lifetime of the strategy, as committed under Ireland’s national development plan.",

As part of providing clarity and certainty for schools, the minor works grant and the ICT grant will be paid annually in the December-January period, so there will be another payment either towards the end of the year or in early January for further ICT grants and this will be incorporated into the Department's grants payment calendar. It is really important schools know when they are getting the grant and I appreciate that over the past number of years it has not been the same figure and it has not happened every year, which has often caused some confusion.",
                    "In addition to capital investment, my Department will continue to support initiatives that advance digital learning in schools. We will continue to advance digital education policy and embed technology in teaching and learning. We invest €15 million annually in the schools broadband programme, which has been absolutely essential for our schools, thereby providing high-speed connectivity to all recognised schools. Through Webwise, which is funded by my Department under the EU Internet safety initiative, we are promoting online safety, digital citizenship and media literacy among school leaders, teachers, parents and students.",

This investment is in addition to other important curricular reform which is under way. This includes the introduction of computer science as a leaving certificate subject, the introduction of coding as a short junior cycle programme and the implementation of computational thinking as part of the new primary school curriculum."

There is a commitment to make sure schools receive that. What I hope to see and what I am looking for the Department to do next year, is an assessment of what schools actually have. Having invested this money, not just from this strategy but from the previous one, it is to assess what schools have, where they need upgrades and whether schools need new equipment or whether we are getting to the stage where the equipment just needs to be upgraded and we are investing to make sure the technology is up to date and the schools have exactly what they need."

It provides a range of free online courses that are available to school teachers and school leaders on certain things such as security for schools and AI for schools. It supports awareness of and confidence in emerging technologies, leading digital learning and developing a digital learning plan for schools. It gives teachers support in what they use the funding for and how they present that. There are courses on strengthening leadership and planning; and coding and computational thinking using Scratch, promoting creativity and problem-solving at a primary level. That is now very much embedded in the primary school curriculum. Schools are doing this, as I have seen during visits to schools over the past couple of months. There is a course in digital technology for modern foreign language teachers as well with that particular emphasis at primary school level, enhancing learning through technology. There are supports, advice and guidance there.",

That is why the Government is committed to increasing funding to support schools. The programme for Government very clearly commits to increasing capitation funding to schools of all types to ensure that schools can meet the elevated day-to-day running costs. They are not immune to the increasing costs we have seen across the board.",
                    "The commitment in the programme for Government builds on the progress which has been made in recent years. This year specifically, my Department secured €39 million in budget 2026 towards increased capitation funding. This is on a permanent basis so instead of once-off funding, this will go directly into the base for primary, post-primary and special schools. There has also been an increase for the DEIS urban band 1 schools, where there is a particular challenge. We have seen an increase in the standard capitation rates to schools of €50 per pupil for primary schools and €20 per student for post-primary schools. We have also allowed for the increase of €20 in capitation rates for the DEIS urban band one schools and the increased capitation rates will now also see special schools receiving the same rates of capitation rates for young people aged 12 years and over.",

                    "We need to look at how we permanently reduce the costs and one of the ways I believe we can do that is to look at our energy costs. A photovoltaic, PV, solar programme has been rolled out across many of the schools and, already, the feedback I am getting from the schools I have been engaging with is that schools are starting to see a reduction in their overall energy bills. It is really important we can permanently reduce the cost for schools.",
                    "My Department is looking at a body of work to assess the overall data within schools to examine what are the actual costs, where are the hidden costs that maybe we do not see every day that can emerge and add a significant challenge to schools if they are not planned for or pre-empted and of course there is the pressure that this places on the school.",

The unit can advance particular payments to schools to help them during difficult times.

                    "I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Troy, for coming to the House to deal with this important issue, which relates to the progression of a naval base at Dún Laoghaire. The Minister of State will be aware that in recent years Ireland has procured two coastal patrol vessels from the New Zealand navy. These are in the possession of the Irish Naval Service. One of them, the LÉ Aoibhinn, is currently docked in Dún Laoghaire Harbour. I understand that the plan is that they will be used as coastal patrol vessels in the Irish Sea and along the east coast. It seems that the perfect place to base them in those circumstances is Dún Laoghaire Harbour, which is accessible at all points of the tide. This means there is 24-hour access for ships like that in and out of Dún Laoghaire Harbour. It is not a busy commercial harbour, so it is not going to interfere with operations in the way it might in larger, busier harbours like Dublin Port, for example, or some of the other large commercial ports along the east coast. Dún Laoghaire is also close to Dublin, midway along the east coast, so it will be an easy point from which to service the whole of the Irish Sea.",
                    "Equally, it is a very important opportunity to take what is a valuable heritage asset for the State and make it useful in serving the State. Dún Laoghaire Harbour is over 200 years old. It is an enormous Victorian harbour with lots of space. Over the past number of years, it has ceased its commercial function in many respects. The Stena Line had served as a link between Dún Laoghaire and Holyhead, but it ceased operations in 2015. Since then, there has been a need for great investment in the harbour. It is primarily a leisure port, but this does not mean it does not have capacity to do that. The old ferry terminal building is vacant. More importantly, there is a pier there which is unused at the moment. It would require a bit of infrastructural investment to make the pier usable by the Naval Service. There is a real opportunity to make Dún Laoghaire Harbour that base.",
                    "I do not know if plans have been finalised in this regard. I am asking the Minister of State for an update. I have been in touch with Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, which owns and operates Dún Laoghaire Harbour as one of its subsidiaries. I know there has been some discussion, but I am not sure what stage this is at.",
                    "From the point of view of the Naval Service in the first instance, this is the perfect match in view of the fact that the harbour is equipped to deal with such vessels such as those in question, particularly in light of its geographic location and the fact that it can facilitate easy access to the Irish Sea for the one or two patrol vessels to do the job they need to do. We know that the Naval Service needs to build up capacity in this regard.",
                    "In tandem with this, there is also a real opportunity for Dún Laoghaire, which has in some respects lost its greater function, to be more than just a leisure harbour. It is wonderful at that, as I can attest, but it can do so much more for the Irish State and the community adjacent to it by facilitating the LÉ Aoibhinn and perhaps other vessels in berthing there and in patrolling the Irish Sea.",
                    "I absolutely support at least getting to level of ambition 2, referred to in the Report of the Commission on the Defence Forces, and going further. This has to be part of that. I know the Minister of State will agree that there are massive deficits in our lines of defence. One does not have to be gung ho on militarisation to understand that as a militarily non-aligned country, we have to have the capacity to defend ourselves. The function these ships can perform is a defensive one, but it also involves patrolling and carrying out customs, fisheries and drug trafficking enforcement. There is so much work to be done in that regard by the Irish Naval Service. Those in the service have enormous skill sets. We need to work to bulk these up in order to make sure that the service can do the job to which I refer. We also need to provide the service with a base from which its vessels can operate. Dún Laoghaire Harbour seems to be the perfect place to do that. Will the Minister of State provide an update on where the negotiations stand or on whether a decision has been made in respect of this matter?"

There is a long-standing tradition of Naval Service ships using harbours and piers on the east coast for shelter and shore leave. The Report of the Commission on Defence Forces calls for the development of an east-coast base for the Naval Service. Reflecting this, the programme for Government has also recognised the need for an east-coast base. In that regard, the Naval Service has been asked to submit a fully worked-up business case setting out full infrastructure requirements for marine and support-related elements.",
                    "As the Deputy will be aware, the issue of an east-coast base has been discussed in the context of the inshore patrol vessels, IPVs, LÉ Aoibhinn and LÉ Gobnait. These IPVs were acquired with a particular focus on east-coast operations, where they are well suited to key missions like the protection of critical infrastructure. With the LÉ Aoibhinn becoming operational in 2024, the then Tánaiste gave approval to lease berthage in Dún Laoghaire Harbour to support east-coast operations in the short term, likely for a period of five years. With that in mind, the Department has been in discussions with Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, the owner of Dún Laoghaire Harbour, regarding the possibility of leasing berthage for exclusive use by the Naval Service. I am advised that discussions are well advanced and agreement in principle has been reached.",
                    "A Naval Service regeneration plan is due to be submitted for the Tánaiste's consideration. This plan has been devised on foot of a detailed workshop held between senior military officers, led by the Chief of Staff, and senior officials in the Department. The issue of additional naval bases, on the east coast or elsewhere, will be considered in the context of that awaited plan and recommendations arising from same."

We have an opportunity here and one of the things we are lucky to have as a State is a team of committed people, not just in Óglaigh na hÉireann but specifically in the Naval Service. We do need to make it into a navy. We need to give it the equipment and the personnel necessary to operate as a navy, thereby allowing it to serve the people of this country and patrol our waters. More than most countries in the European Union, Ireland has an enormous exclusive economic zone relative to our territorial space. There is a real job to be done here. We have spent quite a lot of time discussing the level of ambition that was set out in the Report of the Commission on the Defence Forces. It is now time to put that into action.",

If we seriously expect people not to leave Óglaigh na hÉireann and go into other careers that might be more lucrative or, more importantly, if we expect people to join Óglaigh na hÉireann and commit themselves to serving this country, then we have to make it worth their while. We have to ensure that the facilities are there for them, that the terms and conditions are there for them, that the equipment is there for them and that we have enough people to serve on the vessels we have in order to ensure that those vessels can do the job they have to do.",

Let us make sure we address this and that we deliver for the Defence Forces and the people who serve in them. As I said, one of the ways we can do that, and I hope this is something that will come to fruition sooner rather than later, is to guarantee that Dún Laoghaire Harbour will be the base for the two inshore patrol vessels, namely, LÉ Aoibhinn and LÉ Gobnait. It makes sense to do so and I hope the Department will commit to doing it with Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council."

                    "I thank the Minister of State for taking this Topical Issue. There is a comprehensive network of CCTV cameras in Limerick. It was established as a direct response to a number of public order challenges in the city. The CCTV is a key pillar in the Limerick regeneration framework implementation plan, LRFIP, which followed on from the Fitzgerald report. This was the flagship Government programme to deal with the significant issues that existed, and still exist, in Limerick's regeneration communities. In essence, it was devised as a consequence of the Fitzgerald report, which was commissioned after some depraved individual burnt out a car with two children in the back of it in Moyross in 2006.",
                    "Limerick city's CCTV system is one of the very good and positive outcomes we have had from regeneration. It is one of the best in the country. The framework and governance are widely acknowledged to be quite good. It was funded by the Department of housing, which gave €880,000 in 2024 for regeneration area CCTV. We acknowledge and accept that regeneration is being wound up. In 2024, Limerick City and County Council made a formal approach to the Department of justice to seek replacement funding, but no allocation was secured. In 2025, Limerick City and County Council and An Garda Síochána submitted a joint business case via the Garda Commissioner for inclusion in budget 2026. To date, no replacement funding has been approved.",
                    "Due to the ongoing uncertainty, the company that runs the CCTV has now issued its staff with protective notice. The implications of this are really grave for us in Limerick. I cannot overstate how revolutionary the network of CCTV cameras has been in policing terms. We have a 70% prosecution rate for a couple of thousand serious incidents and a very high rate of guilty pleas and convictions. I am very worried that we have had several serious incidents in Limerick in the past year alone. I am really afraid that we are going backwards. There have been 17 shootings in the past year and 11 very serious violent incidents on the south side.",
                    "We had a welcome allocation of 20 extra gardaí in the August-September allocation. However, if this scheme is wound down, it will, in effect, nullify that allocation in one fell swoop. I am not the one saying this; it is coming from senior gardaí. The Minister for justice said earlier that he hopes a solution can be found after meeting with the Mayor of Limerick. My colleague Senator Dee Ryan has raised this issue in the Seanad as well. We need a permanent solution because the safety and well-being of the people of Limerick are at risk if the scheme is wound down or the cameras have to be turned off. We also have CCTV approved for the Castletroy greenway, for Garryowen and for Rathkeale in the county. Garryowen is one of the biggest policing blackspots in the city.",
                    "These schemes are in jeopardy if the Department of justice does not put a permanent funding solution in place. We are talking about €600,000 or €700,000. We are not talking about millions or billions of euro. The Government put billions of euro into regeneration. If this funding is refused, we will be put back years. Limerick is a special case. If a fund does not exist , the Minister needs to find or create one. Without Department-led funding, the council will be forced to reduce the monitoring and maintenance and eventually will be forced to turn off some or all of the cameras. This is a big policing and public safety issue."

I am hopeful a solution can be found in the short term to the funding issues that arise to keep the CCTV scheme running. In fairness to both Ministers, they are anxious to see a solution and identified to Mayor Moran what they believe is the short-term solution.",
                    "I recognise Deputy Sheehan's interest in continuing to invest in CCTV to build safer, more secure communities. I thank him for his very positive contribution. Community safety is a top priority for the Government and the Department of justice. Everyone has a right to be safe and to feel safe in their communities. Community CCTV plays an important role in achieving that goal. It is important to note that there are a number of CCTV systems operating in Limerick. I understand the particular system referred to by the Deputy, and, as he alluded to, by Senator Dee Ryan, was established under the regeneration programme in Limerick approximately ten years ago as part of a much broader initiative to improve the quality of life of local communities in Limerick. I understand that, to date, the majority of funding for this CCTV scheme has come from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage as part of the regeneration projects in Limerick, with a significant contribution also being made by Limerick City and County Council. I also understand the CCTV system concerned consists of approximately 240 cameras, with an operating cost for 2024 of more than €800,000. As such, the infrastructure in place in Limerick is well outside the scope of the grant aid scheme administered by the Department of justice which supports community groups wishing to establish community-based CCTV systems in their local area. Grants up to a maximum of €40,000 are available for capital expenditure and up to €5,000 for maintenance under the scheme.",
                    "CCTV is very much part of community safety and it is intended that as the new local community safety partnerships are established, they will take a view on the need for additional CCTV in their areas. In addition, under the Garda Síochána (Recording Devices) Act 2023, the Garda Commissioner will have a significant role to play in the approval of CCTV schemes into the future. It goes without saying that the Government is very much aware of the value of CCTV generally in keeping people safe and ensuring they feel safe. Insofar as this particular scheme is concerned, I hope it will be possible for it to continue to operate as it has done over the past decade."

However, Limerick is a unique place and not just because I am saying it is. It is unique because, unfortunately, we have eight of the top ten most deprived areas in the State. We have some of the best but poorest communities in the entire country. Those communities need extra support. They got that extra support through regeneration, which is now being wound down. There must be a mechanism devised by which the funding that was in the Department of housing, and it is not within that Department's competence to be funding CCTV, can be transferred to the Department of justice because this is a policing and public safety issue.",
                    "Ultimately, it also a cost-saving issue because it reduces the cost of investigation, it reduces the cost to the Courts Service because we have a higher than average guilty plea rate and it takes bad faith actors off the street. I always think of a woman in her late 70s called Rose Hanrahan who was murdered in December 2017 in Thomondgate in Limerick. If it was not for these cameras, Rose's murderer would not have been apprehended, charged and convicted. It was done because the vile individual who set upon Rose that night was caught on this system of cameras.",
                    "At the moment, I am very worried there are the seeds of a feud in Limerick again. We really need these cameras to deal with that properly. We need a proper, long-term funding solution from Government."

As I said, the Government recognises the important role that CCTV plays in building stronger, safer communities across the country. The importance of this matter is demonstrated by the meeting held today between the Mayor and the two relevant Ministers. Since 2017, the Department of justice has administered a grant aid scheme supporting groups wishing to establish a community-based CCTV system in their area. To date, grants totalling over €950,000 have been approved for 36 community schemes across the country. This includes 14 schemes across County Limerick, which have received funding of over €330,000. Under this grant aid scheme, funding is only provided for the cost of equipment. Staffing costs are not covered and the maximum grant under the scheme is €45,000.",

However, it is my understanding that there are local authority CCTV schemes operating in both Dublin and Cork, and possibly elsewhere, that are funded by local authorities. As such, it seems appropriate that the funding requirements for the continued operation of the CCTV system in Limerick need to be again considered by Limerick City and County Council and the Department of housing to ensure the funding arrangements for the CCTV system in Limerick city are placed on a sustainable footing.",

It is something that, between the NTA and the operators of those buses, should not come to the floor of the Dáil. We know BusConnects has been controversial in many places where it has rolled out. It has proven so in the latest phase, phase 7, in the areas of Finglas and Glasnevin that it has impacted. From 19 October, the 9, 83, 140, 40 and 40b were replaced with the new bus routes 23, 24, F1, F2 and F3. While the consultation was done over an extended period, there was dissatisfaction with the routes.",
                    "As in any change process, some people will be happy and others will be unhappy, but there are a number of very simple changes that could have been made to address the issues. However, in the three weeks since the implementation occurred on 19 October, the routes alone are no longer the issue. There has been an absolutely calamitous roll-out of the service over the past three weeks - one of those weeks being the midterm week, when many children were away from school and not using the service. Whatever about people getting used to new routes or trying to find new ways of getting to work or arranging their school runs and so on, the reduced frequency on these routes is now the biggest issue. When you put the failure of certain buses to turn up on top of that, people are waiting, on average, between 30 and 40 minutes, according to the emails I have received. I have received nearly 100 emails in the past three weeks on this issue.",
                    "For example, the new 23 and 24 routes have a reduced frequency. Instead of the bus service being much more frequent, at 10 or 15 minutes, we are now down to 20 minutes. If one of those buses does not turn up, in the morning times children go out for a 8.10 a.m. bus and are not getting that bus until nearly 8.40 a.m. or 8.45 a.m.. They are late for school despite having been at the bus stop for an hour. I am talking about a 15-minute journey here. This is something that should not occur because there is demand for that service and the frequency should be there to meet it. I am getting reports of bus stops with 15 to 20 people waiting on buses. When the bus arrives, there is no room for people to get on. This is happening very early in the route. It might happen at the second or third stop on the route.",
                    "The NTA should be able to resolve these issues with the provider, in this case Dublin Bus, but I am really disappointed with the response of the NTA. It has not reacted to what is clearly an issue around service delivery. It has not reacted to the bedding-in problems and tried to address them. From the feedback of the constituents who have been in touch with me, they are very dissatisfied. This is basic stuff. People plan their day around the bus service. This bus service worked for many years but now, as a result of the changes, there are people being late to work and missing connections and there is the core problem of the routes not servicing the areas that were previously serviced. I will cover that in a moment. At the very least, if Dublin Bus and the NTA are going to implement new services, the frequency should be appropriate to the demand. There should not be extensive numbers of people at bus stops. There should not be limited space on a bus early in the route and there should not be missing buses. A very basic provision of services is needed."

From the outset, I clarify that the Minister for Transport has responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport. However, neither the Minister nor his officials are involved in the day-to-day operation of public transport services. The statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally rests with the National Transport Authority. The NTA works with the public transport operators, which deliver the services and have responsibility for day-to-day operational matters.",
                    "That said, I reassure the Deputy that the Government is strongly committed to providing all citizens with reliable and realistic sustainable mobility options and public transport plays a key role in the delivery of this goal. To support this objective, in budget 2026 the Department of Transport secured €940 million of funding for public service obligation, PSO, and TFI Local Link services. That was a significant 43% uplift, an increase from €658.4 million in 2025. BusConnects is a transformative programme of investment in the bus system, providing better bus services across our cities. It is the largest investment in the bus system in the history of the state and is managed by the NTA. The aim of the network is to improve the existing Transport for Ireland system through enhanced services with high frequency spines and new local, orbital and radial routes.",
                    "The recently launched F spine, providing routes F1, F2, and F3 as part of phase 7 of the BusConnects network redesign, introduces high-frequency 24-hour bus services - routes F1, F2 and 80 - on key corridors, enhancing connectivity between areas such as Tallaght, Finglas, Charlestown and the city centre. This redesign under phase 7 of BusConnects also introduced new radial services - routes 23, 24, 73 and 82 - and the new local route - route L89 - to streamline the network and make services more efficient. The NTA has advised that in advance of these new routes being implemented it distributed over 200,000 booklets to households across all the areas covered by the routes. It also advertised the new services in local media outlets and online, and it provided detailed briefings to local public representatives.",
                    "Separately, the NTA reported a technical fault in the Dublin Bus priority system, which adjusts traffic light signals to ease bus movement. The system malfunctioned for three consecutive days, causing unforeseen delays and significant frustration for customers. The issue was resolved last Wednesday and performance is expected to steadily improve. This issue was separate from the BusConnects new service roll-out, but it impacted all affected Dublin bus routes.",
                    "The performance of all public transport operators is monitored by the NTA as part of the contractual arrangements in place between it and the operators. Importantly, these contractual arrangements allow not only for the monitoring of performance by the NTA and the publication of its annual performance reports, but also for the imposition of financial penalties where performance does not meet the required standards. Improvements are also being introduced to the vehicle location system and real-time passenger information, all of which will improve the reliability of the system. The NTA informed the Minister that it is carefully monitoring capacity and reliability during these early days of the new services and will continue to monitor situations, adjusting where appropriate. I am conscious that is not the experience the Deputy had, though."

                    "I know BusConnects is controversial in different areas. I have encountered that in some areas and it involves some compromises at times. There are positive elements to the service, such as two new 24-hour bus routes, additional new services, connections to the Luas and so on. However, it is the basic design of the service that many people were very disappointed with. There is no longer a local connection between west Finglas and south Finglas, with many people living in one area but their children in school in the other. Routes Nos. 23 and 24 no longer serve the north city centre - the O'Connell Street area - so people from the area are now dropped off at George's Street or Merrion Square, which are miles away from the traditional shopping areas that they would have gone to in Henry Street or Mary Street. There is now no bus service operating in the Beneavin Road area, particularly where it interacts with Glasnevin Avenue. The diversion of the former No. 9 bus from a road that has a bus lane onto Ballygall Road East which does not have a bus lane, makes absolutely no sense. Finally, the east Finglas and Glasnevin area now no longer have a connection to places like Na Fianna, Scoil Mobhí and the Glasnevin-Drumcondra area. They are the structural route issues and I can work with the NTA on those, but what we cannot do is roll out a new service and fail to deliver the proposed service or roll out a new service and provide a less frequent or lower capacity service. This is a matter that the NTA will have to address. In asking the Minister of State this question, the NTA will have had to have prepared a response to input into the Department. I hope doing so was a call for action."

                    "The Deputy is right. Transport connectivity and reliability are critical for the people who live, work and study in Ireland. They are essential to encourage people out of cars and onto public transport. In the latest progress report published in March this year, the BusConnects Dublin programme has shown significant improvements in key performance indicators. There has been an annualised increase of 9.35 million, or 75%, in scheduled service kilometres in the NRD phase 1 F1 to 5B compared to equivalent routes operating prior to the NRD project. Passenger boardings on routes in the NRD phase 1 to 5B increased by 40% when compared with Dublin metropolitan bus routes that have not yet been altered in the redesign network. Overall, the redesign routes saw a 48% increase in passenger boardings while other routes experienced an increase of 8%. Additionally, the interim analysis indicates that 12% more places of employment are now reachable within 30 minutes with the redesign network compared with the pre-BusConnects network. This is moving the network towards the 18% place of employment reachability target.",
                    "It should be noted that the F spine, which is part of the BusConnects Dublin area NRD, was finalised following three rounds of public consultation that culminated in more than 72,000 submissions being received. The overall network represents a major investment in enhanced bus services, delivering a 35% increase in annual in-service kilometres, a significant increase in overall capacity and frequency for customers, as well as more evening and weekend services. The NTA will continue collaborating with operators and customers to enhance the punctuality and reliability of services throughout the NRD. Further, through initiatives such as the capacity improvement programme and implementation of ticketing techniques, the NTA is taking steps to enhance capacity and improve the overall travel experience for passengers.",
                    "I want to assure the Deputy that the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, will relay the concerns raised on the floor of the Dáil tonight to the NTA to ensure a timely intervention and take on board the early teething problems, which we hope is all they are, to the new bus route."

                    "I thank everyone who facilitated me to do this. I have just made my way up from the civic reception in Dundalk to celebrate the Louth Ladies Gaelic Football Association, the Louth senior team and the under-20 team after a spectacular year. Hopefully, there will be more of that to come. I had to leave Jarlath Burns and Marty Morrissey, but this is obviously an incredibly important issue.",
                    "This Topical Issue arises from the retirement of the clinical specialist sonographer in ultrasound at Louth County Hospital in Dundalk. The position was advertised in the summer and there were a number of applications, but there has been no progress in filling the position. There is now serious concern among the staff and public that the position will not be filled at the hospital and that the service, which has been incredibly well used over the years and is growing in demand year on year, will be run without on-site management. This situation is not recommended by the Irish Institute of Radiography and Radiation Therapy, IIRRT, which recommends that there be a clinical specialist sonographer working on site, especially in a hospital the size of Louth County Hospital. This is because such staff play a vital role in managing and supervising the unit.",
                    "The previous clinical specialist sonographer in ultrasound at the Louth hospital was the only full-time radiographer who worked in ultrasound at the hospital. Her retirement leaves vacant three-and-a-half posts, two of which also look after all other scanning such as general X-ray, CT and DXA. A fourth person is due to start at the Louth hospital in January but it will still mean that two of the four at the Louth hospital will be basic-grade radiographers.",
                    "To put it in perspective, the HSE's own numbers are stark. The recently retired clinical specialist sonographer completed 2,000 ultrasounds herself at the Louth hospital in 2024. In the first ten months of this year until her retirement, she had completed 1,465. At the same time, the waiting list for ultrasounds in the hospital's group is the largest it has ever been, with 5,000 outpatient appointments needed at the moment and 35 referrals a day coming into the Louth hospital. The total number of ultrasounds done in Louth County Hospital in 2024 was 7,825, up from 7,608 in 2023.",
                    "The real scandal is that there has been considerable outsourcing of ultrasound scans happening in the north east of the State for many years, with 5,348 ultrasounds done in one private clinic in 2024 alone. Many of these scans are being recorded by HSE radiologists, which they are allowed to do under their HSE contracts. The public waiting list continues to grow and the outsourcing of ultrasounds to private clinics where the HSE is paying a huge amount of money grows also. Instead of putting in jeopardy the ultrasound service at Louth County Hospital, the HSE should be developing it. The best equipment is there but there are two rooms that are not being used to their full capacity due to lack of staff at the hospital.",
                    "Four years ago, a radiologist was on site at Louth County Hospital. Now, there is none. Instead, they are on the phone. It cannot be the case that a clinical specialist position at Louth County Hospital remains unfilled. The clinical specialist sonographer not only does the bulk of the ultrasound scanning but also does the organisation of the list, the management of the service to the public and the oversight and training of other scanning staff. As per guidance from the IIRRT, it is not best practice to run an ultrasound scanning service for Louth County Hospital without a clinical specialist sonographer being on site.",
                    "There are real fears that the whole ultrasound service will be downgraded and frittered away until there is no service. Everything that is needed in order to continue the great service that was being done before the retirement of the clinical specialist sonographer is there, except for the replacement sonographer. Ironically, Louth County Hospital was the first hospital in the State to get a clinical specialist in ultrasound when the service was established all those years ago. It cannot be the case that it does not get one now when it needs it more than ever."

In conjunction with Our Lady of Lourdes, Drogheda these hospitals operate with an integrated managerial and clinical governance system, care pathways and support functions. These hospitals are planning for the future to safeguard against increasing demand including anticipated population growth, particularly among those aged over 75.",
                    "To meet this challenge, projects have been developed in LCH which include theatre access for ear, nose and throat procedures and a Uroflow clinic for urology services. Additionally, a new procedure room will open in 2026 to enhance day services. These developments complement the already significant investments in Drogheda. There has also been an introduction of additional consultant coverage during weekends, extended consultant presence on weekdays and public holidays and expanded specialist availability to support inpatient care and consultations. Likewise, enhanced access to key diagnostics, including imaging at weekends will accelerate treatment pathways.",
                    "More broadly, I would like to outline the positive developments in LCH and Drogheda. This Government is committed to building on the significant investment and improvements made at both hospital sites. This significant investment is demonstrated by the 39% increase in the budget for LCH since 2020. In 2025, the budget was over €31 million, an increase from €23 million in 2020. In the same period, there was a 48% increase in the budget for Drogheda. In 2025, the budget was over €303 million, an increase from €204 million in 2020.",

LCH has 93 inpatient beds, encompassing both adult and paediatric. Since 2020, eight beds were delivered for LCH. Drogheda has 500 beds an increase of 15.7% since 2020. We have also invested in staffing at both hospitals which has increased by 2% in LCH and by 13.5% in Drogheda since 2020.",

Many have declined it - as is their right - because many want to continue to heat their homes with turf. It is the only realistic option for them. Other forms of heating are far too expensive to install.",
                    "This injunction was taken out and it seems that these families are being coerced and forced into this scheme. They do not want to take part in it because they will be left worse off if they do and will not be able to cut turf again. I understand that under the legislation the families could be allowed to harvest turf if the Minister, Deputy Browne, signs an activity requiring consent, ARC, order. Their main ask is that the Minister signs this order to allow them to return to their bogs. I ask the Minister of State to outline if this will be facilitated.",
                    "I also raise the fact that the NPWS is beginning works to wet the bogs of those who have signed up to the scheme. This includes the installation of dam blocks to block drains with the aim of raising the water table in the bog. There are significant concerns surrounding the risk of flooding on neighbouring land, the risk posed by holes left behind and who would be held libel in the case of any injuries caused by these holes. There has been a complete lack of consultation. The NPWS is not responsive at all and does not seem to be accountable to anybody. I also want to raise concerns with the process around the SACs designations. These three bogs were designated to be sites of community importance, SCIs, by 2002. Under the habitats directive, if SCIs are intended to be made special areas of conservation this must be done within six years of them being designated SCIs.",
                    "In this case, the three bogs were not officially designated as SACs until the years between 2021 and 2023. This is in direct conflict with the timelines mandated under the habitats directive but we have had no real explanation yet for this. I ask the Minister of State to provide that this evening. There are questions around the process but the big question the local people want answered is whether the Minister will sign an ARC order to allow turf to be cut in these bogs again."

                    "I thank Deputy O’Hara for raising this important matter, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, and the Minister, Deputy Browne. The bogs at Ardgraigue, Barroughter and Cloonmoylan are special areas of conservation in the Deputy's county of Galway. I reaffirm the Government's commitment to protecting Ireland’s valuable peatlands and to working with all stakeholders. As the Deputy will be aware, peatlands are of cultural, economic and ecological importance to Ireland and are profoundly significant for our communities and our history. They are a cornerstone of many communities; a source of heating, as the Deputy pointed out; a way of passing on knowledge; and a deeply held right for many families.",
                    "The EU habitats directive requires member states to select sites for the protection of habitats that are considered threatened, including active raised bog, which is considered to be in danger of disappearing within the EU territory. Ireland has selected 63 sites for the protection of active raised bog habitats, including Ardgraigue, Barroughter and Cloonmoylan bogs, and has designated these bogs as special areas of conservation. This protects approximately 9% of our original raised bog resource.",
                    "The Government adopted a clear long-term strategy to protect these sites. In 1999 the Government announced arrangements for the cessation of turf cutting on raised bog special areas of conservation, and a compensation package, including for the three bogs the Deputy referenced, was outlined. It also announced that commercial turf cutting would cease on certain SACs and that a ten-year derogation was given for domestic turf cutting. At the end of this derogation, following extensive stakeholder consultation, the cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme was launched in 2011. The scheme was advertised again in 2024, closing to new applicants in 2025.",
                    "These raised bog SACs are included in European sites as identified by the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011. Statutory instruments for each site further affirm their protected status. The cutting of turf may not be carried out or caused to be carried out or continued to be carried out on these plots by any person save in accordance with the provisions of regulation 30 of the 2011 regulations or with the consent of the relevant authority or both. I understand that since 2011, no planning application for turf extraction has been made on Ardgraigue, Barroughter or Cloonmoylan and no formal request for ministerial consent has been received. It is a criminal offence subject to prosecution to extract turf without the required ministerial consent or relevant statutory consent or both.",
                    "Extensive supports have been put in place to assist turf cutters on these sites. The cessation of turf cutting compensation scheme compensates households affected by restrictions on turf cutting for domestic use on raised bog special areas of conservation. To date, the Department has paid out over €7.3 million to 329 families who had been cutting turf on the three bogs in question and is processing a further 118 applications.",

He outlined the compensation schemes available but the reality is there are 40 families in the area who are well aware of the schemes but have not entered the schemes and will not enter them. They have been allowed to cut turf on these bogs for many years. Now they are being left without the fuel they rely on to heat their homes. I have outlined that many of the people affected are elderly. It is a deeply unfair situation. They have been kept in the dark about the process of designating the bogs as SACs and the ongoing works by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS. They feel they are being bullied and coerced into signing up to a scheme they do not wish to sign up to. It is regrettable to see how divisive it becomes in the local community when people are pressured into signing up to something like this.",

Were a request to be received, would it be considered and, in the Minister of State's view, granted? If clarity cannot be provided on these issues, I ask that at the very least, the Minister of State or the Minister, Deputy Browne, or the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, from the Department would meet the families affected and hear first-hand about the impact it is having on them. They are very reasonable people who work hard and want to get on with their lives in peace and quiet. Will the Minister of State or the Minister, Deputy Browne, or the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, from the Department commit to meeting them before the end of the year? I would be more than happy to facilitate it."

The strategy to protect raised bogs dates back to 1999, long before either of us was involved in politics. I will take the Deputy's comments back to both Ministers. I assure him we are prioritising the applications in front of us under the compensation scheme.

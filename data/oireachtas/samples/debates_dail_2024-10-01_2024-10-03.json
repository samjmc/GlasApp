I do not have the date but I have received it and I will move to publish it very shortly. I want to bring it to Government. It is a very good and comprehensive report. One of the reasons I did not publish it right away was I did not want to publish a review that did not have any money behind it.",

That is what the budget was about in this particular area. As the Deputy will be aware, we put a big focus in the budget on cardiovascular disease, which is still one of the biggest killers in the country. Unlike cancer care, women's healthcare and other areas, it has not had the strategic investment, with a plan, that it badly needs. This week I have put a cardiovascular health package together in the budget, with an allocation of €8 million. This includes €600,000 for the all-island congenital heart disease network; €4 million for 45 posts for the first year of the review so we can get on and hire the extra cardiologists and put the extra services in place; and €4 million to support the expansion of early supported discharge teams and, critically, access to acute stroke units, so the stroke strategy has been funded as well. I have also allocated a €600,000 investment in the Irish Heart Foundation to support two fantastic programmes it runs. In addition, from next year onwards, the GP chronic disease management programme will expand to cover three different areas of cardiology.",

It was to look at location and what regions would have full 24-7 PPCI services. There is a separate need for a new cardiovascular strategy that will look at prevention, community care and cardiac care in its totality. As the Minister well knows, the current national cardiac strategy has ceased. It has come to an end, so there is a need for a new strategy. I have been informed by officials in the Minister's Department that they cannot start the work on the new wider strategy until the report into the acute services has been published. As such, it needs to be published. The Minister said that will be \"in a few weeks\". There is a lot of speculation as to what might happen in the next few weeks. No political party can go out and make promises on any issue unless we have full sight of the independent report into emergency cardiac services. That report needs to be published well in advance of an election. Can the Minister be clearer and firmer about what he means by \"the next few weeks\"? Will he give an indication of what recommendations the report makes for the south east, in particular University Hospital Waterford?"

When the Deputy sees the report he will see it is a comprehensive piece of work. What Professor Nolan and his team have done goes well beyond where 24-7 care should be. They did the work around cardiovascular diseases. As the Deputy will be aware, more than one in four deaths in Ireland is caused by cardiovascular disease. The report Professor Nolan has authored speaks to a lot of issues raised by the Deputy. It looks not only at acute care but also cardiovascular disease across the country. That is why we have put this package together. We have funding for the report, the stroke strategy, the Irish Heart Foundation and GPs as well. That element of this week's budget was intended to say we would apply funding right across the board, be it for GPs, community care, diagnostics or acute care."

Additional hours of emergency services, extending them from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days per week, will eventually be provided whenever we get the staff to provide them. I also welcome that. There is still a question mark over whether there is a commitment to full 24-7 cardiac care. The people of the south east and Waterford deserve to know the answer to that question. Is it in the report? Has that been recommended? Is that the position of the Government? I could raise issues about what politicians have said in the past on this issue but I will not do so today. I am only interested in what is in this report for the State and, of course, specifically for Waterford and the south east.

                    "Will the Minister give me his view regarding the feasibility of the proposal to extend the opening hours of the medical assessment unit at Nenagh Hospital? The idea and principle of expanding the opening hours of the medical assessment units at Nenagh and Ennis are understandable and logical. This could work if implemented properly. It would create more activity in Nenagh Hospital and mean that patients from north Tipperary could be referred by GPs to Nenagh rather than to Limerick. Patients could be assessed and triaged in Nenagh and only those who needed to be would be sent to Limerick. It would alleviate the pressure on accident and emergency services at University Hospital Limerick. It would also help to rotate beds faster for patients from north Tipperary who need acute care in Limerick. There is only one big problem - it is not working in practice. The existing medical assessment unit in Nenagh is malfunctioning and not being used to its full potential."

It is currently open seven days a week from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Last year, more than 4,000 patients were referred to the medical assessment unit in Nenagh.

The service was provided five days per week and is now provided seven days per week from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. I confirm that the policy is to move to 24 hours per day. Recruitment is under way and the posts have been sanctioned for that. There is ongoing discussion with the representative bodies and unions. They have raised concerns around rosters and working patterns with which the HSE is engaging. I would like those issues to be resolved because, as I said, the funding and posts are there. I want to get those posts hired into as quickly as possible so that we can open a 24-7 service, as the Deputy said. Once the ongoing engagement with the unions ends, we can move in that direction very quickly."

In my last meeting with the board a few weeks ago, the board’s view was that the contractor had fewer than half the staff on site that were needed. Deputy Cullinane and I go into, as we should, the details around contracts, withheld money and so on, but at a simple level, if any of us paid a builder to build us a wall and the builder put half the number of bricklayers on the job that was agreed, the wall would take longer to build.

                    "In everything I have heard from the Government, there has been a dodging of responsibility on its side. There is plenty of blame to go around, including for the contractor, but cheques are still being written. The contract does not contain the necessary levers to hold the contractor to account. The Government’s strategy is not to give the contractor any more money, and I see the wisdom in that, but that is not progressing the hospital. I asked the Minister a question today, so when he speaks again, he might answer it. All these years later, he is still not in a position to tell me, children or the people of Ireland when the hospital will be completed, handed over, open and treating children. He might prove me wrong when he takes to his feet, but I have not heard that date from him or anyone else in government."

Does he accept that that has to do with flaws in the contract? Despite all of the tough talk and Ministers sticking their chests out and saying they will take on the contractor, we are no closer to the hospital being built than we were this time last year. I have had similar exchanges with the Minister in this Chamber and we have had debates at the Oireachtas health committee. No one can tell us when the hospital will be built and open. All the while, we have a blame game, with the contractor blaming the board and the board blaming the contractor. We go around in circles and we make no progress. There has to be political accountability as well as a holding of the contractor to account. For all the Minister’s talk of levers, brakes and other measures to put pressure on the contractor, they are not working. Is the problem that they do not actually exist and that the State is powerless to hold the contractor to account, all the while writing cheques even though children are waiting for the hospital to be built?"

There have been a few important additions which Dr. Fitzsimons and all the other GPs will be aware of and will be part of. One is the expansion of IVF eligibility, which will make a big difference to a lot of couples. The first step on that fertility journey is with the GP. It is they who refer into the six regional centres, who then refer on for IVF. HRT is being made free. This has been welcomed around the country. The medical professionals and GPs are saying it is great because it removes barriers. I was talking to one lady in Wicklow yesterday who said she was spending €1,000 a year on HRT. I commend Dr. Fitzsimons and all of our GPs around the country on their championing of the women's health priorities over the last years."

There have been challenges and children have been waiting too long. A good deal of the delay came about through Covid and the HSE is still in the process of catch-up. The Government invests over €200 million into oral healthcare services annually. To the points the Deputy has made around the waiting list, an additional €17 million in one-off funding has been invested in the lifetime of this Government.",
                "I fully acknowledge that we need to do more. In the budget we announced this week, I have allocated €4 million in full-year funding, including €2 million next year, to continue the implementation of the national oral health policy. This investment is going to provide an additional 15 dental staff across dentists and dental nurses to deliver the oral healthcare in our community and support children to access the current primary school programme of routine check-ups. The investment will also initiate delivery of a three-year implementation plan for the policy. Reform of our services is really important to ensure people of all ages get access to the care they need.",
                "The Deputy has previously raised orthodontics and the need for more support there. I am happy to say the investments we have been putting in over recent years are now yielding results. Last year we transferred more than 2,000 children nationally to private care, so they got care quicker. From the Deputy's own constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, 128 children were transferred to this care. The number who are waiting the longest to start treatment has declined nationally and continues to decline. The HSE and our oral health professionals will use that €4 million now to continue to push on, making sure these children get access to the interventions, check-ups and treatment they need in a timely manner."

At the end of this year there are about 2,500 funded posts vacant. Not only have we had a record level of healthcare workers in the country, but between now and the end of next year there is another 6,500 vacant posts that are fully funded. However, I fully accept that there are individual teams and services that really are under pressure. The good news is that there are funded vacant posts in the Deputy's area and the HSE is looking to fill them. They include two specialist orthodontic vacancies in the Dundalk clinic, as well as one consultant orthodontic vacancy. The money is there, the posts are there and recruitment is ongoing. I will ask the HSE to redouble its efforts to fill those posts as a matter of urgency."

Multidisciplinary eating disorder teams for adults and CAMHS are being rolled out throughout the country. There are now 11 teams in place, comprising six adult teams and five for child and adolescent mental health services. Earlier this year, I announced the establishment of a new adult team for CHO 7, which will cover the areas of Kildare-west Wicklow, west Dublin, south Dublin city and south-west Dublin, bringing the number to 12. To date, more than 100 posts are funded under the national clinical programme. More than 80 eating disorder clinicians, including ten consultant psychiatrists, are now treating people with eating disorders. Last year, the HSE made a dedicated investment of €8.1 million under the clinical programme.",

This will bring the total number of teams nationwide to 14. CHO 3, therefore, covering Limerick, north Tipperary and Clare will get an eating disorder team for CAMHS, which will comprise ten whole-time equivalent staff.

It recommends the development of 12 adult specialist dual diagnosis teams nationally and four adolescent teams. A total of €2 million has been provided for the service to date, with recruitment for adult teams in the mid-west and Cork and adolescent teams in Dublin at an advanced stage. I have allocated a further €600,000 in budget 2025 to enhance teams and establish a further two teams. This will include the appointment of: two whole-time equivalent appointments for community healthcare organisation, CHO, 3, which will enhance the existing team; one whole-time equivalent for CHO 9, which is the substance abuse service specific to youth, SASSY, team; one whole-time equivalent for CHO 4 for Cork Prison, which will be a new and really important team; three whole-time equivalents for CHO 7, which is an adolescent team, specifically, the youth drug and alcohol service, YoDA, team; and three whole-time equivalents for CHO 5 for a new team in Waterford.

It has indicated that a resource proposal will be submitted when the work is complete. That was not yet available when the Estimates were being done. We are working closely with the HSE. Dual diagnosis involves a complicated model. Some of the funding is provided from the drugs budget and some from the mental health budget."

I raised the matter again with the former Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton. I expected the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, to take this question today. Will the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, indicate who has responsibility for the Keltoi centre? Under which Department does it fall? When more than one Department has responsibility for something, it can fall through the cracks. The Keltoi centre plays a really vital role. As with eating disorders, which we have talked about, it is important to have an inpatient facility where people can go to get out of society for a while and access the specialist help they need. I support the model of care the Minister of State has been talking about but we need that residential provision. When will the service reopen?"

                    "Medical card provision is primarily based on financial assessment. In accordance with the Health Act 1970, eligibility for a medical card is determined by the HSE, which assesses each application on a qualifying financial threshold. The idea of granting medical cards or GP visit cards based on any particular disease or illness has been considered. It is a topic we discuss regularly in the Dáil. There are Deputies, for example, who have made a very reasonable case for cancer care patients. The proposal is that a cancer diagnosis would trigger eligibility for a medical card.",
                    "This issue was looked at in detail by an expert group in 2014. The group concluded that it is not possible to list and prioritise conditions for medical card eligibility without creating risks of inequity by diagnosis or condition. As it was explained to me, we cannot create a hierarchy of disease. The expert group could not find a solid ethical approach that would justify saying \"Yes\" to cancer patients and neurological patients, for instance, and \"No\" to cardiovascular and diabetes patients. The group said it just cannot be done like that. We cannot create a hierarchy whereby one disease or illness is deemed to be more worthy than another.",
                    "While I fully appreciate the Deputy's question, which is one that is discussed quite regularly in the House, the consistent position, which we should maintain, is that eligibility is based on other criteria. There is the financial assessment, as we are aware. There are a lot of discretionary medical cards given out. I might come back to that in my next response."

However, from the perspective of somebody who has come to me and told me their story about suffering from this illness, it brings huge additional costs. I referred to one constituent in the Rathcormack area. They explained to me the flare-ups of their condition and having to travel unexpectedly to and from a healthcare facility in the midlands. It just comes across to me as being unfair and discriminatory that the State healthcare system does not step in and intervene in a case that merits that intervention. The Minister referred to the discretionary medical card. I would be delighted to speak to him individually about the case to which I have just made a brief reference. We do this best on the basis of age. I know we have just come through a budgetary process, but perhaps this is something we could reflect on for the future, broadening it on the criterion of illness as well as on that of age."

One in eight medical cards is discretionary, and that is meant to speak to exactly the kinds of cases the Deputy talks about. The discretionary medical card is issued to patients with big medical expenses. They might satisfy the gross income criterion but not the net income criterion. Once they have to pay all these medical expenses, they do not have enough money. That really is the purpose of the discretionary medical card. If the discretionary card is failing some people who really cannot afford their medical care or cannot pay their bills because of their medical care, we may need to review that. As I said, however, nearly 200,000 discretionary medical cards are live at the moment.",

I meet so many people in that constituency who cannot access their local GP.

I want to raise this on the floor of the Dáil with the Minister. It may be our final exchange before the general election. This is a huge issue in north Cork for the constituents I represent and it matters to them. The people I have spoken to can be emotive about this, and they are right to be. They are angry.

The request has to be that the criteria need to be broadened to take into account the fact, as described by Deputy O'Connor and as we have described many times at the health committee, that there are people who are really under pressure, who find themselves in panic - very often older people or younger people - and who see themselves being ignored by the system. For instance, in one particular case a procedural error took place and the person is now on expensive medication and so on. That will go to court, but that does not help the person in the meantime, and that is the problem. I ask, like my colleague did, that the discretion be looked at to see if the criteria can be broadened to allow in the people whom we are talking about.

Any debate like this is very important to constantly reviewing and finding those patients who find themselves outside of the various criteria. It is usually by a small amount but it still causes a lot of hardship. The measures we have brought in will help. We have abolished inpatient hospital charges. They were costing families up to €800 a year We have just funded free HRT. One lady yesterday in Wicklow told me she is spending €1,000 a year on HRT. We are funding IVF. Couples were spending €7,000, €8,000, €9,000, €10,000 or €12,000 on IVF. We have brought the drug payments scheme threshold down to €80 a month. We have brought in free contraception. We have rolled out eligibility for another 500,000 people to get free GP care. What we must constantly do is identify the people whose cases the Deputies raise today to ask who are the people who still cannot afford the healthcare they need. We must constantly review our eligibility to support them."

One of the pillars is affordability, which we just discussed, and another is rapid access. A huge amount of what we have been doing over the past four to five years is to speed up access to care. We have a ways to go. We are probably four years into an eight-year programme of work to meet the agreed ten-to-12-week targets. That is our goal. It has been agreed right across the Oireachtas. I acknowledge the work our healthcare workers have done and the progress they have made in the past four years. Their most remarkable achievement for patients in terms of waiting times is that the average time people wait for a hospital appointment has halved in the past three years and it continues to fall. It was in excess of 13 months; it will shortly be less than seven months, and the target is that no one waits more than three months.

Women referred for gynaecology care in Sligo used to wait four years but they are now waiting four to six weeks. We are seeing more and more examples of this throughout the country. I will come back in my last contribution to this question to talk specifically about children’s spinal care."

I asked at the time, given the situation, whether the HSE could perhaps make a contribution towards it because the patient has to pay back the money. I received an ongoing, rolling maul of a reply to the question. That is one year ago now. We need to show we are compassionate and that the kind of progress to which the Minister referred is being made. While I know it is his intention do that, we need it to happen on the ground in a way that has not happened before. There has been progress in this regard. While I am fully aware of that progress, we need more of it."

A lot more children have been operated on and received care this year than in previous years. That number will keep increasing. In the meantime, however, we are sending children to Great Ormond Street Hospital in London and New York. I am happy to also send children to Pittsburgh and other places. I fully agree that the overriding priority must be for children to get access to high-quality care as quickly as possible."

There is, however, full-year allocation of €50 million. The ask from the Irish Pharmacy Union, IPU, is a lot bigger than that, obviously. It will seek more money, as happens in negotiations but €50 million is a sizeable allocation in the context, for example, of the different ways and patient services that could be funded.",

We received those recommendations and those laws are now in place. I thank the Deputy and others for their support in bringing that forward. We now have a legislative framework to allow pharmacists to extend prescriptions, for medicine substitution protocols and for common conditions. This will bring in a new era in the services pharmacists can provide locally. I have repeatedly said that our pharmacists are highly trained and skilled healthcare professionals who have been underutilised in Ireland for a long time. One pharmacist said to me recently that pharmacists have been waiting 20 years for this new phase. Step one was to get the recommendations, which we have received. Step two was to pass the relevant legislation, which we have done. Step three was to allocate money in the budget, which I did this week. If I asked my officials to negotiate with no money on the table, it would just be paying lip service. It would not be real. I wanted to ensure a real amount was on the table.

The funding allocation is welcome but now the negotiation fee must be addressed. Before the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation was introduced, the dispensing fee was €6. It is €4.51 now. The IPU’s ask is in and around €6.50. A total of 10% of community pharmacies are operating at a loss, as I am sure the Minister knows. Up to one third of them are struggling. He has set the Government’s stall out and he has allocated money, but now it is about the delivery of these negotiations. There is great opportunity in this regard, as he will be aware. There is an appetite among pharmacists to deliver, which will, of course, relieve pressure on our GP services and all the rest. It is something the public want.

Expansion will make a big difference to ordinary punters in the community in that they will not have to go to a GP with minor ailments, such as eye conditions and rashes. Rather, they will be able to get certain prescriptions from pharmacists and have them extended. This is obviously an opportunity for the public and also one for pharmacists in terms of new services.

I met the Minister in his office with departmental officials about this, and it is something we have been working on together. Youghal, as a town, has taken a hammering historically. There were 4,000 people directly employed in traditional industries there and Kodak flash cameras were made there. The town has really been a victim of time, poor government investment and a lack of strategic thinking, and its people feel abandoned. As their representative, I do not blame them for feeling that. This is why decisions like that just discussed in the Chamber matter. They matter to people in Youghal and certainly matter to me as their representative because they are about having government-led investment into the community. This goes beyond healthcare; this is about the State helping a disadvantaged community, a disadvantaged area. The proposed facility, above all else, would be greatly welcomed in east Cork and, indeed, on the other side of the River Blackwater in the area of the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, in County Waterford. It would be very beneficial to the region. Could the Minister give me an insight? Could he visit the location and see the facility at St. Raphael's for himself to try to drive this on as quickly as possible?"

I know he is committed to coming down in mid-October and he will be very welcome when he does so. Towns like Youghal need support from the Government. They have taken on a heavy burden, whether through IPAS accommodation or the lack of industry and investment. That is why it is important that the Government responds through capital plans such as that of the Minister and his Department, bearing in mind how we can deliver and improve upon services in these areas and the congregation of State investment in education. This is just one key example of how it could work so well."

The Government has spent €336,000 on the bike shed, €1.4 million on the security hut and in the budget on Tuesday, we saw the latest example of the waste of taxpayer money when the Government announced it would spend €9 million on phone pouches. The ordinary people of Ireland are asking has this Government lost the plot. This is another example of a Government that cannot be trusted with taxpayers' money. When the Minister for Finance sat at the Cabinet table and made this decision, did not one person put their hand up and ask whether the money should be spent on the 100 children with additional needs who still do not have a school place at this point? Did not one Government Minister at the table say that the money should be spent on increasing capitation funding so that schools can actually cover their lighting and heating bills? Did nobody at the Cabinet table put up their hands and say why do we not just ask the kids to leave their phones in their bags? Spending €9 million on phone pouches is grotesque. It is inexcusable, particularly at a time when Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have underfunded our schools across the State, with many schools - most of them - struggling to pay electricity and heating costs.",

If there were ever an example of political parties being in power for far too long drifting further and further out of touch with the realities on the ground, it is the Tánaiste, when he took to social media this week championing the fact the Government is spending €9 million on phone pouches. You could not make this up. Minister, stop the waste. Unlike the bike shed or the €1.4 million security hut, this money has not yet been wasted. Will the Minister please see sense, announce to the people of Ireland that the Government is not going to waste €9 million on phone pouches, and instead put that money into schools so we can pay for the lights, electricity costs, heating costs and other costs that those schools need?"

                "Recently the Minister’s party leader claimed the Social Democrats believe Ireland is a failed state. It seems as if he was literally making stuff up and saying it on national radio. I have always acknowledged the country's many positives and successes and I have consistently pointed out the profound sense of disconnect many people have as a result of that. This is a disconnect between a GDP that makes us one of the richest countries in the world and nearly 4,500 children growing up in emergency accommodation; a disconnect between full employment and 500,000 adults living in their childhood bedrooms; and a disconnect between a €24 billion surplus and nearly 600,000 people living in poverty. No, we are not a failed State but the Government is failing far too many people and that failure is not inevitable. It is not an accident either. It is a product of political choices that have been made at Cabinet tables in this Government and previous Governments, political choices about what to spend money on and how much, political choices that led to a 15% increase in the number of children experiencing deprivation last year alone, political choices that led to disability services becoming threadbare and dysfunctional, political choices that resulted in a failure to meet social and affordable housing targets every single year and political choices that have set us up to fail when it comes to meeting our climate targets.",
                "This week’s budget was also full of choices about what to prioritise and what issues were deemed not so important. I listened to the Minister for the last few minutes trying to defend the €9 million that was allocated to schools to buy phone pouches. This was done because, fair enough, the Minister for Education wants schools to ban phones but she does not have the power to do that. We can all agree on the need to prioritise mental health and children's mental health but to prioritise phone pouches with regard to that does not make a whole lot of sense to most people. This is €9 million spent on a pet project that schools were not crying out for. It is a lot of money and could have done some real good. That €9 million could have been used to invest in special schools. There is not a single special school in my constituency of Cork South-West. The money could have been used to fund therapists in St. Killian’s Special School in Mayfield, which was promised supports from the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, that never materialised. There have been no occupational therapists, speech and language therapists or behavioural therapists in that special school or any other since 2020 when Fianna Fáil entered government. The Tánaiste said he disagreed with the decision that resulted in therapists being removed from schools. Well a Fianna Fáil Minister holds that brief, a Fianna Fáil TD is the disability Minister and Deputy Chambers is the Minister for Finance. What has been done about it? Nothing, as far as I can see while children with additional needs are repeatedly failed - failed not by anonymous systems but by political choices. Does the Minister at the very least accept that his Government has failed these children with additional needs?"

There has been an unprecedented investment of €11.8 billion in education and schools in budget 2025. The education budget contains €2.9 billion of funding for special education, which will make a difference for those with additional needs and support the provision of additional places and progress for many families and children. The provision of free school books to all students in the senior cycle makes a difference when it comes to the affordability of education across our school system. There has been a €75 million increase in capitation funding, which supports schools and communities across our country that need improved core budgets. There is over €100 million in additional funding for the school transport system and there are 1,600 more SNAs and 750 additional special education teachers. That makes a difference for students with additional needs, particularly in the special education area. This is why we have sought to advance that in the context of budget 2025.",
                "The Deputy referenced the investment in mobile phone pouches. As I said to Deputy Doherty, this is about investing in wider support for mental health and well-being in schools. We need a practical outworking to this initiative. Parents have reflected concerns about this at second level for many years. This enables schools to implement such a policy by supporting them.",
                "The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has been steadfast in securing a much greater disability budget. If we look at the investment in disability since 2019, we can see it has increased by 52%. There is a clear commitment on the part of this Government to help support those with disabilities and their families. Not only are we speaking about the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities, we are ensuring that the increase in spending is delivering real improvements in the lives of children with additional needs. This year, there is a record €3.2 billion of funding in the disability area. There is a focus on assessments of need, therapies and ensuring we recruit the front-line staff, who do make a difference. I recognise that the wait times for many children with disabilities are too long in communities across our country and that they are not getting the level of intervention they require but the investment and the prioritisation from the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, will increase the number of front-line workers in the CDNTs, which will help through the budget we have allocated."

What this will result in is further progress on many of the initiatives established by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte. In the first half of this year, regarding the waiting lists initiative, there has been improvement in the number of assessments of need completed, which is a 28% increase on the same period last year. Regional hubs have been established across the country and are operational and there is strong oversight from the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, to ensure there is delivery and much greater progress in terms of oversight with all of the various CHO teams across the country.",

I received a letter from a senior member of the medical team at the hospital that highlighted the issue around this case.",

It had no access to an elective ward because it had to accommodate and facilitate emergencies that were pouring in through the emergency department. This is entirely unacceptable as the volume of patients being seen at Midland Regional Hospital has increased 40% year on year. By any objective analysis, this is a huge volume for a model 3 hospital.",

While the staff at Midland Regional Hospital are working heroically to meet the level of demand, and I commend them on all they are doing, unfortunately, it is clear that they have hit a wall and unless there is improved capacity is put into the system, things will only get worse for local patients who will continue to be sent to other counties to access basic services through the National Treatment Purchase Fund.",

Without this solution, the knock-on impact to service provision and delayed care will continue to get only worse. The Government has just announced one of the largest ever budgets for the health service. What fraction of that allocation will be directed to Tullamore hospital? Will consideration be given to an elective surgery hub?"

This is making a difference for patients, families and communities across our country. Over €25 billion is being spent in 2025. The recent budget will see a further €180 million in new measures, including support for cancer care, cardiovascular and stroke care as well as rare diseases. The impact of this investment in healthcare by the Government is seen in the very significant achievements Ireland has made in the last decade in health outcomes. We are among a small group of only seven EU countries where life expectancy is above 82 years, and we are seeing the impact of that across a number of metrics.",
                "We know we have to do more, which is why the Minister for Health has set out a very ambitious capital plan to address the demand for surgery and an elective plan within that. He has set out the development of four elective hospitals at two sites in Dublin, one in Connolly and one at the children’s hospital in Crumlin, one in Cork and one in Galway. Surgical hubs are also being delivered in Cork, Dublin, Galway, Limerick and Waterford. This complements the wider focus of the Government on the primary care system, with many patients who would have otherwise presented to emergency departments being triaged through community healthcare and supported through the community health service with chronic disease management and a whole other range of areas.",

The Minister is advancing that through acute hospitals, some of which are in the midlands region, through the wider provision of new beds in the hospital groups.",
                "The Minister will be able to provide detail on further plans on the Deputy’s specific question on an elective hospital for the midlands. I have set out the briefing I have received on the various surgical hubs and also the elective capacity planned, which has a good regional spread. It is important that patients in the midlands and elsewhere have access to improved elective care. In future, our overall capital investment will ensure we have a greater number of elective beds in the hospital system, so that the acute hospital system can manage the presentations that occur day to day. This will allow greater certainty for patients who are waiting for elective care on an ongoing basis."

It is not just me saying there is a problem. The medical staff are saying it and elderly patients who cannot access local care are telling me there is an issue and they have to go to other counties for elective surgery. That is wrong.

Similarly, there are plans for further staff recruitment in the Midland Regional Hospital group and Tullamore for next year. That builds on the progress we have made as regards the trolley count in Tullamore, for example, where we are seeing an impact in wait times. We have more to do, however.

She was offered a 50 cent per hour increase by her employer after 16 years without a pay increase. Colleagues in a similar position were given raises of €1.50 an hour. Cobh Heritage Centre justified this paltry offer by saying Marianne had received a €2 pay increase 15 years ago. You could not make this up. Marianne was represented by Unite the Union at the Workplace Relations Commission and won a recommendation for an 85 cent raise to match the living wage. The board of management of the Cobh Heritage Centre, which relies on public finance and support, has been refusing to implement the recommendation since 8 May this year.",

It did not even plead inability to pay at the hearing of the case and it gave the case to The HR Suite, a private company, to represent it at the Workplace Relations Commission. This is simply not good enough. Marianne's Unite the Union representative, Eoin Drummey, has written to the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, and to the Tánaiste on her behalf stating that this refusal not only perpetuates the mistreatment of a long-standing female employee on low pay but also undermines the authority of the WRC and the principles of fair and just employment practices which it upholds. It is unacceptable that a State-sponsored and supported entity should fail to rectify a situation that has caused significant hardship for Ms Byrne over several years. There has been no reply or even acknowledgement from either the Minister or the Tánaiste.",

I have made other representations on other occasions on behalf of Unite the Union and other unions for low-paid workers, particularly in relation to workers in voluntary and State-funded organisations. Ireland has one of the highest incidence of low pay in the EU. Not enough is being done for these workers. The very least the Government can do is to ensure that State-funded organisations are passing on WRC adjudications. Cobh Heritage Centre relies on State funding but is refusing to pass on a WRC recommendation and justifies this by reference to a pay increase 15 years ago and has ultimately failed to pay its workers a living wage. What can the Minister and the Government do to step in here? He can ensure that Marianne gets the pay rise she deserves and can ensure that the WRC is not being undermined by an organisation funded and supported by the State."

The Government accepted the recommendation of the Low Pay Commission because of that. That demonstrates our wider commitment to progress a living wage in our economy.

I am asking the Minister and the Government to intervene to ensure that public bodies implement WRC adjudications on cases referred to the WRC. The fact is that the State provides the Workplace Relations Commission as a statutory body to assist in resolving workplace disputes and complaints. This service is fully funded by the public through the Exchequer and its decisions should be implemented promptly by all employers, particularly those receiving public funding.

I do not have the specific operational plan here with me but we set out clearly is that €1 billion is to ensure that Irish Water can move on many of the projects across the country where there have been concerns about its ability to deliver. This is only the start. We have said that the proceeds of future AIB share sales will be prioritised in housing, water and our grid infrastructure and we have a separate process with the windfall receipts we received to prioritise water infrastructure as well. Through that process, Irish Water will be able to scale the delivery of many schemes right across the country as water infrastructure is key to the wider delivery of housing. I will ask the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, to provide further details on the company's operational plans."

To address that we have a lot of plans ongoing on increasing the supply of qualified healthcare graduates in dentistry and the respective therapy disciplines, so we have increased the pipeline of workers who can provide that service. That is something that has been ongoing between both the Department of further and higher education and the Department of Health so we can build capacity for the future. There have not been sufficient dental graduate to meet the level of demand, especially in community dental services.

Budget 2025 will provide for the recruitment of between 800 and 1,000 new gardaí along with 150 Garda staff and move towards 1,000 Garda Reserve members. All of that work is about supporting front-line policing in communities across our country and also in Dublin where I am aware there is a need to ensure a front-line response.

Some of its operatives are behaving in a very aggressive manner in the pursuit of vulnerable long-term borrowers who, for compelling reasons, were not able to service their loans. Those loans were sold to vulture funds, some at a fraction of the face value, but people are now being pursued aggressively for the full face value and arrears, leaving them with no option other than to become homeless, in which case they do not qualify for local authority housing. Those people become homeless to facilitate the vulture funds. I am asking that the licence issued by the Central Bank be reviewed and the activity of this organisation be reviewed as a matter of extreme urgency."

They are of great assistance in terms of visibility to other road users, including other cyclists and pedestrians as well as motorists. In areas where there are no footpaths or streetlights, which is the case in large parts of the country, will the Government consider making it mandatory for people walking on roads without footpaths and with no streetlights to wear a high-visibility jacket? That would be a protection for vulnerable road users. It is important that we all help each other. My view is that it is a bit like helmets in hurling. When they were introduced, there was a bit of resistance and people said they were unnecessary. No kid would now think of going out on a hurling pitch without a helmet.

One of its main objectives is to provide for the establishment of a marine accident investigation unit, MAIU, within the Department of Transport. It provides for a transition from the current structure, in which the Marine Casualty Investigation Board, MCIB, is the designated investigative body, to the establishment of a full-time permanent marine accident investigation unit analogous to the Air Accident Investigation Unit, AAIU, and the Railway Accident Investigation Unit, RAIU.",
                "The Bill provides for a regulatory regime to be put in place for the construction and operation of offshore service vessels operating in Ireland to support the offshore renewable energy sector and for the carriage of industrial personnel. This will provide the most robust system to ensure that such vessels are safe to operate and provide protection to the crew and the industrial personnel being carried. I will explain what I mean by “industrial personnel” shortly.",
                "I am also taking the opportunity to update the references to two conventions, namely, the International Maritime Organisation’s safety of life at sea, SOLAS, convention and the International Labour Organization’s Maritime Labour Convention. We are updating these conventions in existing law to enable more recent amendments to them to be addressed in national secondary legislation.",
                "I will go through the Bill’s sections and the issues covered later. Before I do so, to assist Members and provide some context, I will outline the background to the Bill, the history of marine accident investigation in this State and the reasons for the proposed transition from the MCIB to the MAIU as provided for in the Bill.",
                "Historically, the legislative provision for marine accident investigation dates to the Merchant Shipping Act 1894, which then applied to Ireland and the UK. We then had the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act 2000, which implemented the recommendations of the investigation of marine casualties policy review group, namely, the establishment of the MCIB as an independent State body to investigate marine casualties and publish reports of such investigations. The group’s report to the Minister for Marine and Natural Resources was published in 1998. Later EU legislation in this area focused on larger commercial vessels via a 2009 directive that required the designation of a marine accident investigative body. The directive was transposed in 2011 and the MCIB became the designated body in Ireland. In July 2020, a judgment by the Court of Justice of the EU found that, due to the presence of two departmental officials on the MCIB who were seen as persons whose interests could conflict with the task entrusted to the MCIB, Ireland did not fully comply with the independence elements of the directive. To be clear, there was no finding of wrongdoing by any court on the part of any member of the board or in respect of any investigation carried out by the MCIB, but the judgment raised procedural issues with the board’s structure and membership and the potential for conflicts that were important to address. Immediate steps were taken to address the judgment, including the resignation of the two board members concerned and the amendment of secondary legislation. Following this, the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) (Amendment) Act 2022 facilitated a revised board composition and the appointment of new members.",
                "Following the judgment, my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, took the opportunity to commission a fundamental review of Ireland’s marine casualty investigation structures in the context of international, European and domestic obligations. The review was undertaken by Clinchmaritime Limited, headed by Captain Steve Clinch, a former chief inspector of marine accidents for the UK’s Marine Accident Investigation Branch. The final report of the review was received in July 2021. Its second recommendation that the Minister for Transport should establish a functionally independent MAIU within the Department of Transport and that the reporting structure and staffing model should be in line with that already in place in the AAIU and the RAIU forms the basis of the Bill’s provisions.",
                "In March 2022, the Government approved policy proposals for the development of a revised legislative framework for the marine accident investigation structures based on the establishment of a full-time, permanent MAIU. A draft general scheme was approved by the Government in December 2022. Pre-legislative scrutiny was carried out by the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications and its report was published on the 2 May 2023. Where appropriate and possible, the recommendations of the committee have been incorporated in the Bill. I thank colleagues from the committee for their assistance in that.",
                "Turning now to the Bill proper and looking at the specifics, it consists of five Parts and 52 sections. Part 1, Preliminary and General, is comprised of sections 1 to 5. These sections provide for standard legislative matters, including Short Title, interpretation, regulation-making powers, expenses and repeals and revocations. The 2000 Act will be repealed and the European Communities (Merchant Shipping) (Investigation of Accidents) Regulations 2011, Statutory Instrument 276 of 2011, will be revoked. Section 2 includes the definitions for Parts 1 to 4. In particular, I highlight the broad definition of \"ship\", which allows for the MAIU to investigate marine accidents involving any kind of marine vessel. Some definitions, including those for \"marine accident\" and \"marine casualty\", for example, are taken directly from the International Maritime Organization's casualty investigation code.",
                "Part 2, Marine Accident Investigation Unit, is comprised of sections 6 to 15. This Part sets out the key provisions of the MAIU. Section 6 provides for the Minister to appoint a day for the establishment of the MAIU. Section 7 establishes the MAIU within the Department and provides for the MAIU to be independent in its organisation and in the performance of its functions of any other person or body whose interests could conflict with it. This section also designates the MAIU as the marine safety investigation authority for the purposes of Article 8 of the EU directive. Section 8 provides for the functions of the MAIU, which include carrying out marine safety investigations, making safety recommendations and publishing reports on each investigation. Section 9 provides that the MAIU will be staffed with independent investigators, including a chief investigator who will lead the new unit. Section 10 provides for the functions of the chief investigator, which include the management of the MAIU and responsibilities in relation to ensuring its compliance with the independence requirements of the EU directive. It also provides that the chief investigator shall not receive instruction from any official in my Department with a role in maritime policy or operations.",
                "Section 11 provides for the Minister to develop a policy to manage conflicts of interest for staff within the MAIU, the Department and external consultants and advisers. It also provides for the Minister to designate a civil servant within the Department, who is not involved in the maritime area, as a point of contact for any issues arising with conflicts of interest. Section 12 provides for the removal of an investigator from an investigation due to a breach of the conflicts of interest policy. Section 13 provides for the engagement of consultants and advisers by the chief investigator for the purpose of conducting a marine safety investigation. Section 14 provides for the MAIU to keep itself informed where a public authority may have a function which has a bearing on matters with which the MAIU is concerned. Section 15 provides for the MAIU to publish an annual report identifying the marine accidents that occurred during that year.",
                "Part 3, Marine Accidents and Reporting, comprises sections 16 to 34 and provides for the marine accident investigation criteria and the requirements of reporting marine accidents to the MAIU. Section 16 provides for the requirement of the MAIU to investigate very serious casualties involving ships within the scope of the EU directive. It also provides for the MAIU to carry out a preliminary assessment to determine if a marine safety investigation is required depending on the nature of the vessel and the marine accident.",
                "Section 17 provides for the requirements of the master and-or owner of a ship, and certain maritime authorities, to notify the MAIU of marine accidents. Failure of the master or owner to notify the MAIU of an accident is an offence. Section 18 provides for the requirement of parties involved in a marine accident to provide relevant information regarding the causes of a marine accident as requested by the MAIU. Section 19 provides that the purpose of a marine safety investigation is not to attribute fault or blame but that it shall not preclude the MAIU fully reporting on the causes of a marine accident if fault or liability could be inferred. Sections 20 and 21 transpose requirements of the directive to provide for the notification to the European Commission if the MAIU considers urgent action is required to prevent the risk of new casualties and for the MAIU to provide mutual assistance to member states carrying out a marine safety investigation.",
                "Sections 22 to 27, inclusive, provide for the powers of investigators to conduct investigations, obtain a search warrant, take possession of objects, give directions to secure a marine accident site and obtain records or other information as appropriate when conducting an investigation and for the preservation of evidence following a marine accident.",
                "Section 28 provides for the disclosure of confidential information by staff within the MAIU to be prohibited unless authorised by the designated person or required by law. Section 29 provides for an investigator to request a person to undergo a medical or physical examination if deemed relevant for the purposes of a marine safety investigation. Section 30 provides for the detention of a ship if an investigator deems it necessary and for an investigator to require crew members to stay in the vicinity for a period not exceeding 24 hours. Section 31 allows for the MAIU to reopen a completed marine safety investigation if new evidence becomes available that is likely to materially alter the findings. Sections 32 and 33 provide for the process around providing observations on a draft marine safety investigation report and on the publication of a marine safety investigation report. Section 34 provides for immunities from claims for the Minister and for consultants and advisers where they act in good faith.",
                "Part 4, Dissolution of MCIB, comprises sections 35 to 43, inclusive. Section 35 provides for the dissolution of the MCIB on the appointed day. Section 36 transfers the rights and liabilities from the MCIB to the Minister. Section 37 transfers the records of the MCIB to the Minister. Section 38 provides for any claim for liability or loss occurring before dissolution to be transferred from the MCIB to the Minister. Section 39 provides for the final accounts and the final annual report of the MCIB to be completed by the MAIU. Section 40 provides for the completion by the MAIU of anything that was commenced by the MCIB. Section 41 provides for anyone who has acted on behalf of the MCIB to be immune from claims following its dissolution, as long as they have acted in good faith. Section 42 provides for the transitional investigation provisions for marine safety investigations already under way when the MAIU is established. Any investigation commenced prior to the establishment of the MAIU may be completed by the investigator warranted by MCIB. In a situation where an MCIB investigator cannot complete the investigation, an investigator for the MAIU will complete the investigation instead. Investigations commenced prior to the establishment of the MAIU will be carried out under the legislative provisions of the Act of 2000. Section 43 provides for the admissibility in evidence of documents kept by the MCIB to still be admissible after the appointed day.",
                "Part 5 is concerned with the regulation of offshore service vessels and updates to the references to two IMO conventions in legislation. It comprises sections 44 to 52. Section 44 sets out the definitions associated with Part 5. In particular, definitions are included for industrial personnel, offshore industrial activities, offshore service vessels and the IP code which are all definitions associated with the SOLAS Convention. In addition, a definition of \"passenger\" has been provided for to specifically exclude industrial personnel from being classed as passengers. A definition is also provided for an industrial personnel safety certificate which is the certificate which will be issued to the vessel following a survey confirming compliance with legislative requirements. Industrial personnel in this context are envisaged as being workers on the offshore rigs who are being transported to and from their place of work at sea.",
                "Section 45 provides for the application of Part 5. This Part applies to Irish offshore service vessels, foreign-flagged offshore service vessels that wish to operate on regular domestic voyages in Ireland and foreign-flagged offshore services vessels while they are in a port in the State. Section 46 sets out the ability to make offshore service vessel and industrial personnel rules. These rules may provide for the design and construction of the vessel, its machinery, installations, equipment and systems. In addition, the rules may provide for the carriage of industrial personnel and include requirements on training, medical fitness, health and safety and accident prevention. The rules may also set out the number of passengers, industrial personnel, crew and other persons who are permitted to be carried on board. Different rules may be made for different classes of offshore service vessel having regard to such matters as the size and speed of the vessel, nature and duration of its voyage, numbers on board and the type of cargo being carried. Furthermore, the rules may provide for the surveying of such vessels and the different types of surveys that can be carried out. These surveys will either be carried out by the Marine Survey Office or by a recognised organisation acting on behalf of the Minister for Transport. Any such recognised organisation will be one recognised at EU level with which a formal agreement with my Department has been put in place.",
                "Finally, there is scope to exempt a class of offshore vessel from a provision of the rules.",
                "Section 47 provides for the powers of authorised persons. As mentioned, this will be either a surveyor from the Marine Survey Office or a recognised organisation acting on behalf of the Minister for Transport. This section sets out the general power to board a vessel and survey and inspect it, including its machinery and equipment, along any documentation kept onboard. There is also the ability to question the crew and take copies of any records. The section also provides for the ability to set fees for surveys and inspections with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform. Under the section, it is an offence to obstruct or interfere with an authorised person in the course of their duties or to make any false declaration to such an authorised person.",
                "Section 48 provides for the issuing of an industrial personnel safety certificate. This section sets out the process to be followed when a surveyor from the Marine Survey Office has completed the survey and is satisfied a vessel meets the requirements of the rules. Once a declaration of survey has been issued by a surveyor, the vessel can be issued with an industrial personnel safety certificate. Where this certificate is issued to a vessel within the scope of the SOLAS Convention, that is, a vessel of more than 500 gross tonnes on international voyages, it will be issued with an international industrial personnel safety certificate. In the case of any other offshore service vessel, it will be issued with an Irish industrial personnel safety certificate. Under this section, there is also the ability for a recognised organisation to issue a certificate to vessels falling within the scope of the SOLAS Convention. Only the Marine Survey Office, however, can issue an Irish industrial personnel safety certificate.",
                "Under this section, the owner of a foreign-flagged offshore service vessel is not permitted to operate on domestic voyages without first securing an Irish industrial personnel safety certificate. In these circumstances, the certificate may be issued where the vessel has been built to a standard set by the flag state that is of a standard equivalent to that which is required under the Irish rules and, therefore, the usual principle of reciprocity applies. An industrial personnel safety certificate will be valid for a period of no more than five years and will be linked to the other safety certificates applicable to the vessel. Should its underlying safety certificate be suspended, withdrawn or revoked, the industrial personnel safety certificate will become invalid.",
                "The industrial personnel safety certificate for the vessel will specify the number of persons permitted to be carried on board, whether crew, passengers or industrial personnel, and it is an offence for the owner or master of the vessel to carry persons in excess of the number specified in that certificate. In addition, a master or owner of a vessel is not permitted to operate that vessel as an offshore service vessel without such a valid industrial personnel safety certificate and the master is not permitted to proceed to sea without having a copy of that certificate on board. Furthermore, no changes are permitted to the structure of the vessel or its machinery or equipment without the Department’s prior approval, unless it is to replace or repair defective equipment, which should then be done to the same or higher standard.",
                "Section 49 sets out the criteria for the endorsement, extension, suspension or revocation of an industrial personnel safety certificate. Following periodic surveys, an authorised person can endorse the certificate to record that the vessel continues to comply with the relevant rules. Where this certificate expires during a voyage, it can be extended for a maximum period of three months to allow the vessel time to get to a port where it can undergo a renewal survey. This section also sets out the circumstances under which a certificate may be suspended or revoked and the ability of a certificate to be reinstated after suspension once any identified deficiencies have been rectified. Provision is made for a person to appeal such a suspension or the revocation of a certificate to the Circuit Court.",
                "Section 50 provides a surveyor from the Marine Survey Office with the power to detain an offshore vessel where the vessel is not in compliance with the relevant rules. A person has the power to appeal a notice to detention also to the Circuit Court.",
                "Section 51 sets out the offences and penalties for non-compliance with various sections under this Part of the Bill.",
                "Section 52 sets out consequential amendments required to other merchant shipping Acts on foot of the new requirements for offshore service vessels. A new definition is inserted for the SOLAS Convention in the merchant shipping Act 1952 to take account of the amendments made to the convention regarding the new Chapter XV on the carriage of industrial personnel. The Merchant Shipping Act 1992 is amended to include the relevant definitions relating to offshore service vessels and remove the default position of such vessels being classed as passenger boats or passenger ships. Section 18 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1992 is also amended to allow for a new class of passenger boat to be assigned for the carriage of fewer than 12 industrial personnel. The Merchant Shipping Act 2010 is amended to update chapter X of the SOLAS Convention, in respect of high-speed craft, and to allow rules for high-speed craft that fall outside the scope of the SOLAS Convention to be made. An amendment is also made to sections 57 and 58 of the 2010 Act to allow for regulations to be made by the Minister for any type of vessel in respect of safe manning levels. A further amendment made to section 87 of the Merchant Shipping Act 2010 updates the definition of the Maritime Labour Convention to allow for updates to regulations to be made under that section to give effect to recent amendments to the Maritime Labour Convention.",
                "I express my appreciation for the ongoing work of the MCIB, its board members and its investigators. The move now towards a full-time, permanent maritime investigation resource will build on the important contribution the MCIB has set down in this area. I commend the Bill to the House."

                "I am conscious the Minister of State is new to this brief, and while he will be aware there is a long history to this whole area, he may not be an expert on it, which is forgivable. Nevertheless, I want to go back over the history that got us here today. It is quite embarrassing, with episode after episode of the failure to implement expert recommendations.",
                "The Oireachtas transport and communications committee dealt with this about a year and a half ago. It published its report and made its recommendations as part of pre-legislative scrutiny. We can see in the digest produced by the Oireachtas Library and Research Service that only a minority of the recommendations were accepted by the Department and included in the published Bill we are debating on Second Stage. It is profoundly disrespectful to have made families who have lost loved ones and those who have campaigned for many years lose yet another year and a half.",
                "We are now debating the Bill on Second Stage, but if we are being honest, we know that legislation coming before the House next week will be guillotined, rushed through and moved on. I do not think this Bill will see the light of day or conclude before the end of this term. Only the Taoiseach can truly know the date of the election, but it is deeply disappointing to be only dealing with the Bill today. Those who have been waiting for these changes to happen, and who had lost faith in what was there, will look on with great cynicism, which is deeply regrettable. We have had the Lacey report of 2010 and the Clinch report. On the latter, as the Minister of State will know, the recommendations were made available to the committee as part of its pre-legislative scrutiny, but they have never been fully published. The Oireachtas committee asked for the full publication of that report to assist us legislators in this process but, unfortunately, that has not happened. That is deeply regrettable and it leaves a vacuum.",
                "The Minister of State referred to the European judgment against us, which, again, just shows the dither and repeated delays. I have to say that this is wrong. During the committee's pre-legislative scrutiny, we had two expert witnesses, Mr. Michael Kingston and Mr. Ciaran McCarthy, and it is clear the committee was very taken by their evidence and acted on many of their recommendations. Again, we rely on them, and I am grateful to them for their ongoing expert advice on these matters.",
                "The Donegal coroner, Dr. McCauley, making recommendations in May 2022, asked the Minister responsible to finally take on board previous recommendations seeking the mandatory training of all persons taking vessels to sea, to educate all seafarers that a mobile phone is not an adequate radio communication device on its own, that VHF radios are deemed mandatory in all vessels taken to the sea and that education programmes should continuously highlight not only the possession but the wearing of lifejackets, and to review the code of practice to remove any inconsistencies in the document and have it presented in a more user-friendly, readable format.",
                "Those recommendations were made after an inquest. The coroner was very exercised about it. There is no evidence that those basic recommendations, which the ordinary citizen would expect to apply, have been implemented. There is a continual failure to learn from mistakes. We all accept that tragedies can happen despite everybody's best efforts. The point is that we should learn from them. Recommendations from coroners and experts have been ignored and overlooked again and again.",
                "The inquest I mentioned took place in my home county. More recently, there was the Caitríona Lucas inquest. In the case of both inquests, there was a failure to co-operate by the MCIB and the Department of Transport. My goodness, it is shocking. We are talking about inquests to establish the facts of what happened in the case of a death. The attitude was, \"We have done our report, we are beyond question and reproach and that is it.\" There was a failure to engage further. That will have to change. It is an incredible omission in the Bill that there is no provision to instruct the MCIB, or the replacement body that is proposed to come into being, to participate in inquests.",
                "I will now address some of our issues and concerns with the Bill. To be clear, if the legislation manages to make it to Committee and Report Stages, we will be proposing amendments. Section 4 deals with the expenses of the Minister. We agree with the guidance that what is proposed in this provision is not sufficient. It does not take into account the reasoning of the Oireachtas committee that there must be robust provision in the legislation to ensure funding is fit for purpose. We will be introducing amendments to this section. There is much within the Róisín Lacey report from 2010 that should be reviewed. I ask the Minister of State to go back over the report to see how it fits with the legislation that has been presented.",
                "Section 9 deals with the appointment of investigators. This provision is not sufficient. It does not take into account the comprehensive reasoning by the Oireachtas committee that there must be robust provision in the legislation ensuring each investigation is carried out by a suitably qualified investigator. We will submit amendments to strengthen the section.",
                "Section 14 sets out requirements that the proposed new body must keep itself informed on certain matters. The section refers to the European Commission, the European Maritime Safety Agency, EMSA, the International Maritime Organization, IMO, the International Labour Organization, ILO, and any other relevant authority. There is no requirement that the new body should seek to be represented on those authorities. There needs to be full sharing and learning, not doing what was done in the past, which was expert guidance reports just being ignored. There must be an openness to evolve and arrive at a shared understanding. We will seek to introduce changes to this section.",
                "Section 15 deals with the annual report to be provided by the new body. The report should identify the safety recommendations and actions that were issued by complementary or relevant organisations that are relevant to the work of the proposed body. We will come back to the Minister of State on this provision.",
                "The provisions in section 27 regarding the preservation of evidence are not strong enough. This is an area that came into sharp focus in the context of the Caitríona Lucas inquest. We want to see provision for the new body to develop memorandums of understanding with the Health and Safety Authority, An Garda Síochána, the Civil Defence, the Irish Coast Guard and other bodies on the protection of evidence. Procedures should be outlined in the legislation indicating which organisations have priority at re-enactments. This provision needs to be strengthened considerably. If we look across the water to Britain, what I have outlined is in operation there.",
                "Section 31 deals with the reopening of safety investigations. The inquest I referred to was into the deaths of Ger Doherty and Thomas Weir, who died off the coast of Malin Head in 2018. It was at their inquest that the coroner, Dr. McCauley, made the recommendations to which I referred. I note again that he strongly criticised the MCIB for not co-operating with his inquest. We need much strengthened provisions in this regard. There is an omission in the section. We need the Minister to have the ability to order and instruct examinations. There is not enough within the legislation on that. We will come back to the Minister of State in this regard on the next Stage.",
                "There is another omission in the Bill. We have talked about reviewing outcomes and having the legislative power to go back over an outcome when there is clear evidence it is flawed. I really appeal to the Minister of State on this point. Provision must be included for investigators to appear before coroners' courts. It is not acceptable that there is no such requirement. They must be able to stand over their reports and allow the coroner to probe matters. Investigators have an independent job to do and their findings may be hurtful to the families of the deceased. Sometimes, the outcome they arrive at could be wrong. They certainly should be subject to questioning on their findings in a coroner's court. I ask the Minister of State to address this point.",
                "There is no provision in the legislation regarding Department employees working for the new body. This is relevant to the question of independence. The Lacey report called for a multimodal body, covering air, rail and marine. Everything would be under the one roof and the body would be fully resourced and completely independent. There is a lack of clarity in the Bill. The concern in the European finding was that Department employees should not be moving from one role to another in a short space of time. We need to look at that with a view to amendment. There is a mistake in the approach to independence. The legislation attempts to give all sorts of assurances that the new body will be independent from the Department of Transport. However, there is an ongoing concern that it will not, in fact, be fully independent, properly resourced and use properly qualified investigators. We need to revisit the whole area of independence to provide assurance on these points. We will look to introduce amendments in this regard.",
                "In its pre-legislative scrutiny report, the Oireachtas committee recommended that \"the Minister should include provisions in the General Scheme for the ratification of the Cape Town Agreement for the Safety of Fishing Vessels in order to assist the international effort\". The reason this was not done, the Department has said, is that the Government is in the process of engaging on all of that.",
                "There are concerns about who is engaging on behalf of the State, whether there are conflicts of interest and why this has not been implemented. One of the excuses is that our oversight is stronger. I think we want to be part of an international statement on marine safety and independence and want lessons to be learnt. That is what we keep hearing again and again from the loved ones of those who have lost their lives.",
                "I now move on to the offshore area. We have submissions from Wind Energy Ireland. Reading through the points it makes, I think they are reasonable. I will take the Minister of State through them in the time I have remaining.",
                "As regards section 8, Wind Energy Ireland asks on behalf of its members if clarity could be given as to the division of responsibility between the new proposed unit and the Health and Safety Authority. Is a different approach taken if an accident on a vessel occurs when it is tied up? I imagine that this submission has been sent to the Department. It has been sent to Oireachtas Members. If it has not been sent to the Department, perhaps the Minister of State would contact me afterwards. I am happy to forward the entire submission. That is a reasonable point. There are a few others.",
                "As regards guard vessels, I am the Sinn Féin spokesperson on fisheries and the marine, and this is a matter in which I have a particular interest. In its submission, Wind Energy Ireland states that Ireland has the disappointment of both the offshore renewable energy industry and the fishing community choosing not to permit fishing vessels to perform guard vessel duties. That is really regrettable. As the Minister of State will know, people in the fishing community are struggling. It is a matter of that ability to diversify. There is also the offshore renewable energy and seafood task force, which is trying to address the concerns of fishermen. When offshore renewable energy is being developed, they should be first in the queue to financially benefit from this, considering that they are struggling. That is an area we need to look at. The lack of reference to guard vessels in the Bill raises the question as to what, if any, the legal definition of a guard vessel is in Irish law. Section 44 clearly defines, for example, a fishing vessel and an offshore service vessel, but neither of those is a guard vessel, though they could arguably carry out that function. That needs to be looked at.",
                "Could the Government confirm whether the intent of the definition of offshore industrial activities, also under section 44, is not to include pre-construction activity? If that is the case, does this have any implications for the definition of an offshore service vessel? Again, that is a reasonable question. Wind Energy Ireland also states it would be helpful for the Government to clarify the regulatory framework for small vessels carrying up to 12 personnel, including safety equipment standards, operational guidelines and certifications. What is this about? The Bill specifies vessels carrying 12 or more industrial personnel, which is in turn defined elsewhere in section 44. What does one do when there are fewer than 12? Wind Energy Ireland is looking for clarification on that.",
                "As regards section 46, Wind Energy Ireland says the Government could set out a timeline for the development of these rules and commit to early and detailed engagement with the industry prior to commencement of drafting. This is where there is reference to setting the rules governing the requirements for offshore service vessels, which are referred to as offshore service vessel and industrial personnel rules. Again, Wind Energy Ireland just wants clarity around consultation in that regard. It is not clear from section 46 how the offshore service vessel and industrial personnel rules will evolve to deal with new vessel types. Will the rules be subject to periodic review and, if so, how often and by whom? How can such reviews be initiated or requested? Wind Energy Ireland has a number of questions about how subsection (6) of section 48 would work in practice. This is about foreign-flagged vessels. The Minister of State will have this submission. I will not read verbatim what it states here. They are very reasonable and legitimate questions. I appreciate that this whole area of offshore renewables is an evolving one, but we need to deal with it and address it, and I do not think it is dealt with properly. I invite the Minister of State to read the submission and address the reasonable concerns.",
                "On the first reading of section 48(13), it sounds reasonable in its reference to \"changes to the structure, equipment or fittings of the vessel to which the certificate applies, without the prior approval of the Minister\". They could have an impact on safety without the awareness of the Minister. Again, how does that work in practice? How is that dealt with? That is a genuine concern.",
                "The final issue I will raise relates to training and certification. While the Bill refers to safety certificates for industrial personnel, it does not provide specific training requirements. Wind Energy Ireland offers up the Global Wind Organisation but there is a range of organisations that could be referred to specifically. It is too vague. Is the Marine Survey Office being recognised?",
                "There is a lot of work to do on this, and I ask you to bear with the Opposition. We will put in constructive amendments."

                "I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Lawless, for bringing forward this very important legislation, the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Accidents) Bill, and compliment him on really hitting the ground running since his appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Transport and bringing forward some really important legislation and reform and doing Kildare North very proud. I come from a marine county, County Wexford, where we have a very proud history and heritage in the seafaring world. We have many commemorations, such as the Rosslare Burrow Lifeboat Memorial, which I attend every year. It is a very poignant ceremony to mark the heroic rescue by the Coast Guard, from the Keeragh rocks, in February 1914, of the crew of the Norwegian schooner Mexico as well as the survivors of the Fethard lifeboat, the Helen Blake. It is just one example of the many memorials right across our country, including County Wexford, to those who lost their lives, those who took huge risks to rescue and save people. It is an extraordinary thing to do.",
                "This Government is very proud of the work it has done in the marine area during its lifetime. In addition, for example, we established the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority to regulate licences and consents off the shores of Ireland. That too is based in County Wexford. There is also almost €250 million in investment going into Rosslare Europort, which will act as an economic driver, and the development of offshore renewable energy. All this is very important to ensure, as regards those who use our seas, our maritime area, our marine area, that there is a proper and effective marine investigative unit and having the marine accident investigation unit.",
                "I compliment my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Lawless, on his work to date and acknowledge generally the good work that has been done right across the Government for our maritime area, recognising the importance of that, including in the environmental area. Some 90% of all heat capture is in our seas, and we have to remember that. As an expert in the area once said to me, you cannot divide a sea up the way you can fields or to say you can do this in this area and that in that area. It is all so intertwined and affects greatly everything we do."

                "The ambition of this Bill is to replace the Marine Casualty Investigation Board, a body which was flawed from its inception. The fundamental weakness of the board was the presence on the board of the chief surveyor of the Marine Survey Office and the Secretary General of the Department of Transport, people who by their positions were objectively biased. It is not about the individuals, but they were objectively biased. The function of the Marine Casualty Investigation Board was to investigate maritime accidents, which could potentially have been caused by the actions of persons within the Department of Transport whose duties are, for example, to certify shipping.",
                "The body also suffered from an acute lack of resourcing and top-tier professionalism when compared with the air and rail investigative equivalents and a failure to stipulate that the board members be appropriately qualified or experienced. In essence, a board was established which was empowered to investigate itself and has resulted in the production of substandard reports, with a resultant failure to properly document or learn from incidents, some of which had tragic outcomes.",
                "For example, I remember debating the report that followed the awful tragedy of the Rescue 116 helicopter crash. It was very detailed and we discussed it at length. We were told it was not about apportioning blame but rather about making sure the same thing did not happen again. It is hard to believe Ireland is a maritime country. We have a bigger coastline than most European countries but our governance of it has been so remiss.",
                "The State was able to get away with this model until 2009, when the EU introduced a directive obliging member states to establish bodies to investigate marine accidents and to ensure their impartiality and independence. The European Commission began infringement proceedings in 2015, which the State chose to challenge and which ultimately ended with a wholly predictable adverse finding by the Court of Justice of the European Union in July 2020. To add insult to injury, it is reported that at the time, the State was left liable for costs over the decision to challenge the European Commission’s issue with the make-up of the board. Who gave the advice to initiate that challenge when the outcome was so predictable? Anyone taking a cursory glance at the failure in this regard would have said that we could not win the case. Why, therefore, was the case taken forward? I do not understand the thinking behind that decision.",
                "We were told the practice in these cases is that neither the European Commission nor the member states - Ireland in this instance - ever actually seek their costs, and, therefore, it is a notional concept. I want to know about costs. In my opinion, a notional concept means that it just does not arise. Of course, you cannot take a case without cost. While we are not paying on both sides, it has a cost on our side to take that case, even if it is done in-house. There are opportunity costs by virtue of the fact that staff have to be deployed to do that work. I do not accept that it is a notional cost. There is an actual cost in taking those cases. We should not have taken that case in the first place. We should have accepted there was an issue that urgently needed to be addressed and should have addressed it.",
                "The decision addressed the narrow issue of whether the presence of the chief surveyor and the Secretary General on the board compromised its independence. It found that it did. The decision did not consider any of the other failings of the Marine Casualty Investigation Board. The chief surveyor and the Secretary General resigned from the board and the Minister introduced a short statutory instrument, as a stop-gap measure, obviously. I understand there was an attempt to fast-track amending legislation through the Dáil and to bypass pre-legislative scrutiny on the basis that the legislation was urgent. It must be remembered that this case was taken in 2015. We were notified in 2009. This is gun-to-the-head stuff rather than going through the process which produces the optimal outcome. Pre-legislative scrutiny can be enormously helpful. The contributions made by some of the witnesses, including that of my colleague, Ciarán McCarthy, before the Joint Committee on Transport and Communications regarding this Bill were incredibly important in improving this piece of legislation.",
                "This new Bill is an effort to remedy the earlier botched legislation that was brought in after the EU ruling. The Bill, while primarily focused on marine accident investigation, also encompasses specialised offshore service vessels. Legislation is needed in this area as the Government has increased our offshore wind targets needed to be achieved by 2030. Obviously, that is needed.",
                "Tackling climate change is an existential crisis of our generation. Establishing a sustainable source of renewable offshore energy will be key to this. I noted in the budget the amount provided for the Port of Cork. We do not actually have a port that is sufficient to deal with the construction of offshore platforms. This measure will remedy that. It is a good location with a natural harbour. It is important that this decision was made. It is long overdue. It is quite extraordinary we had that huge resource of offshore energy but we are only now getting around to designating a port. I acknowledge it has been done and that resources have been made available.",
                "I welcome that the Minister has chosen to disband the existing Marine Casualty Investigation Board and replace it with another body. We urgently require legislation specific to the types of ships we will need to build and maintain our offshore infrastructure. Ireland has been in breach of its obligations under the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, SOLAS, for decades. It is a relief this is being addressed. It is disheartening, however, to contemplate yet another proposal to amend the Merchant Shipping Act 1894 and to shoehorn into the same Bill a number of disparate proposals. While the Victorians were ingenious, it is a fallacy to suppose that people who lived 130 years ago had the foresight to regulate offshore renewable energy in 2023 or 2024. The individual issues of marine accident investigation, offshore renewable production, safety of life at sea and the working conditions of seafarers are each by themselves deserving of specific legislation.",
                "The majority of this Bill is concerned with a body to be known as the marine accident investigation unit. The Bill will transpose EU Directive No. 2009/18 establishing principles governing the investigation of accidents, which was introduced as part of the EU-wide Erika suite of maritime safety measures following the Prestige and Erika tanker incidents. The recitals of the directive speak to the need to hold unbiased investigations by qualified investigators within an independent body to help prevent the recurrence of casualties. Article 8.1 provides that suitably qualified investigators, competent in matters relating to marine casualties and incidents belonging to an investigative body which is independent in its organisation, legal structure and decision-making of any party whose interests could conflict with the task entrusted to it. Article 8.2 of the directive provides that individual investigators, “have a working knowledge of, and practical experience in” the matters they are to investigate.",
                "Ireland previously sought to transpose the directive through the European Communities (Merchant Shipping) (Investigation of Accidents) Regulations 2011, that is, SI 276 of 2011. In the course of a ruling, however, delivered on 9 July 2020 in case C-257/19 the Court of Justice of the European Union, it was found that the presence of the chief surveyor of the Marine Survey Office and the Secretary General of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, or his or her nominee further to section 9(1) of the Merchant Shipping (Investigation of Marine Casualties) Act 2000, on the MCIB meant the objective independence of the body could not be guaranteed. This Bill is an attempt to rectify these issues and establish a body that is in conformity with EU law.",
                "The Bill makes provision for the establishment of the new marine accident investigation unit within the Department of Transport. Although the text mirrors that of the directive with respect to independence of organisation, legal structure and decision-making, the objective independence of the proposed new organisation is undermined by its being a part of the Department of Transport, given that it is not inconceivable that it would be called upon to investigate instances involving divisions of the Irish maritime directorate of the Department of Transport, such as the Marine Survey Office or the Coast Guard.",
                "Ideally, this body should be under the remit of a different Department, perhaps the Department of Justice. There is potential for continuing conflict in this area.",
                "Also provided for will be the persons with qualifications to be appointed as investigators and chief investigator. The Bill does not state what qualifications such people should hold. The marine accident investigation unit is to be provided with extensive powers, including the power to initiate investigations and the rights to use reasonable force to gain entry and require medical examinations of persons. These are extensive powers and responsibilities, yet the Bill is silent on the qualifications or backgrounds of the investigators who will use them and in stipulating that the investigators be competent in matters relating to marine casualties and incidents and have a working knowledge of, and practical experience in, the matters they are to investigate, as required by the directive. I would be concerned if people were asked for their qualifications in court and could not state what they were. There could be a challenge in such circumstances. I would have believed a basic requirement would be to specify the range of qualifications. There can be a range. There seems to be a quite significant gap in this regard.",
                "Part of the Bill concerns offshore service vessels and their personnel onboard. Although legislation currently exists to regulate oil and gas extraction, Ireland does not have laws regulating specialist vessels engaged in the construction and maintenance of structures used to exploit offshore renewable energy. We do not recognise categorisations of such ships under special purpose ship codes or work boat codes, nor do we accept crew certification for the operation of such vessels with limitations in terms of purpose, power or areas of operation, as is the case in the UK. There are examples in other jurisdictions and it is not as if we have to reinvent the wheel. We should be examining what has been done elsewhere and what we need to do now. Otherwise, we will be back legislating in this area again. What should be future-proofed in this legislation does not appear to be future-proofed.",
                "The methodology employed by the Marine Survey Office is to insist that vessels in the category in question, both Irish registered and foreign flagged and which regularly dock at the country’s ports, must acquire Irish passenger ship or Irish passenger boat certification and Irish load line certificates.",
                "Provision is also made for a new category of passengers, to be known as \"industrial personnel\", who are persons transported or accommodated for the purpose of offshore industrial activities performed on board other ships or offshore facilities. A ship carrying such persons will not be required to be certified as a passenger vessel but will instead be categorised as an \"offshore service vessel\", which will be obliged to comply with the rules contained in Part 6. The Minister may make rules for offshore service vessels and industrial personnel with respect to design, construction and equipping vessels, and also the carriage of industrial personnel, including in respect of their training and medical fitness; however, the Bill does not make any reference to the licensing and training of persons who will be required to operate these ships. There are things to go back on here and we need to get ahead of them.",
                "This area should be subject to stand-alone legislation given its importance to the offshore renewable commitments for the next decade. Given that we have designated the Port of Cork and provided funding, we can anticipate the needs. We must not wait until there is an accident, a directive from the EU or criticism from the Commission; rather, we need to put the matter in the work plan and do the work in a timely way. What happens offshore changes all the time and it is certainly not equivalent to what happened in Victorian times.",
                "Marine accident reports are incredibly important to those who have lost family members or loved ones at sea. It is important that an organisation be capable of delivering the detail and that the investigation be conducted by people who are professional and can give families the answers. This relates even to giving a date of death for those missing for a period of time. This is really important to families. It might seem fairly obvious but sometimes there is a question mark over even this.",
                "There is quite a bit of work to be done in this area, and we have to get ahead of it because offshore energy generation, particularly wind energy generation, will play a huge part in what will happen in the future. It has to happen. We have a unique opportunity that others would bite our hand off for but we have to put all the building blocks in place to make sure the work is done safely and properly legislated for."

In fairness to him, during his time as committee Chair, he did a lot of work on this legislation. I wish him well with his health and thank him. I also thank Michael Kingston, barrister, who assisted me and members of the transport committee greatly. He worked closely with Joe Carey.",

The Minister of State, Deputy Browne, in his contribution, was fulsome in his praise of the heroic rescuers, including lifeboat crews, and rightly so. We accept that fully. We could not say enough about rescuers’ efforts and the danger they put themselves in to protect and save others. However, we have been laggards with this legislation. There is an appalling vista, going back to the terrible Whiddy Island tragedy, which occurred when I was a young buachaill. We have a list of such tragedies.",

I compliment John’s sister, Anne-Marie – or Annie, as she is known by her family, including her mother and father – on her heroic battle to get justice and answers regarding what happened on a beautiful but fatal afternoon on 23 May 2010. I am referring to the battle she has fought and the blockades that were put up. Those concerned appeared before the committee and their evidence was heard.",
                "The State has utterly failed in this area since its inception. This Bill is timely but the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, should not be clapping himself on the back at all, talking about the money he is giving and everything else. We need robust, proper, meaningful, copper-fastened legislation that can cover all this. We have had the Wild West for decades.",
                "Not one of the members of the Marine Casualty Investigation Board had seagoing experience. This would only happen in Ireland. The Bill is weak regarding the make-up of the board and, more importantly, the qualifications of its members, as Deputy Murphy and others referred to. We must move away from circumstances in which members are appointed at the whim of political parties and Ministers. Names are put forward just to give people nice jobs, retirement supports or whatever. It is shocking. We have to have completely experienced, dedicated, qualified members whose knowledge and authority are not in question. We must not have the families of the 50 people who have lost their lives seeking answers. In addition to John O’Brien and Pat Esmonde, there are numerous others. I do not have their names with me today. Families such as the O’Brien family and the Esmonde family in Tipperary town are yearning for answers and closure but cannot get them. John and Pat, two young men, were out fishing. There was a farcical cover-up – \"farcical\" is probably too light a word for it – and there was no investigation. We had many meetings with superintendents, chief superintendents and assistant commissioners to get answers, but we got nothing.",
                "We were stonewalled, were told that someone would come back to us and send us another letter or report. Nothing came.",
                "Justice is what it is all about. There must be justice, punishments and retribution for wrongdoing. To do that, we have to have meaningful systems and set-ups that are robust and independent enough to hold these people accountable. In that case, the two men were out fishing for mackerel when a big boat came along and caused a bow wave, which turned them upside-down and left them in the water screaming for help. The people on the boat turned around, came back and saw them screaming for help. Two of them died. The MCIB had no seagoing experience. The gardaí in Dungarvan refused to have any meaningful investigation. The boat was taken into the custody of Dungarvan Garda station, where the motor mysteriously disappeared. A less valuable and less powerful engine was swapped onto it. Have you ever heard the like of it? That happened inside the compound of a Garda station that is fully operational 24-7. The men's families had to beg and beg. Anne Marie O'Brien had to go down to Dungarvan a year after the incident and put up A4-sized posters on poles looking for witnesses. Witnesses came forward who were on the sea that day and were nearly turned upside down. It took 14 months for gardaí to interview those witnesses. One of them had passed away. It is a shocking tale of carelessness, downright wrongdoing and lack of investigation. I am glad that the legislation before us makes some efforts to tackle this but we must insist that investigators are held accountable and brought before the coroner's court to get answers. The Waterford Coroner's Court left us with many more questions than answers regarding this case. The legislation has to be robust enough. Michael Kingston gave evidence at committee hearings stating that we need legislation. We had the Lacey report, many other reports and international experience was drawn on. Why must we be the laggards here, unable to have proper, fit-for-purpose legislation that is robust?",
                "As I said, there must be a situation where the investigators, whom we hope and expect would be competent, would have no problem coming before the coroner's court or being questioned by anybody, including the Garda or participating in an independent report because they would be qualified. They were not qualified in this case. We saw that when findings were issued against Ireland. Incompetent people were on the board and had to resign. We have been hobbling along ever since from one crisis to the next, trying to make amends.",
                "Section 15 provides for the production of an annual report. This section must be very robust as well. I hope, alongside Sinn Féin, to table some amendments to the Bill. I hope they get a good ear from the Minister of State, whether that is now or after the dust has settled and this Dáil has gone. I do not expect to see it enacted by this Government, but it has to be.",
                "I thank Shane Ross. I worked with him, and despite many an argument, he came down to Tipperary and visited the O'Brien family and listened to their case. He provided a listening ear. Our job, as legislators, is to listen to the people, act for them and protect them above all else. I raise the whole situation regarding the protection of evidence and securing the scene. In the O'Brien and Esmonde case, nobody was there to see what went on. The boat that caused the wave was not impounded or searched and no forensic evidence was taken to identify who was driving it. A whale watcher was sitting 600 m away. Apparently he heard the two young men screaming for help. I know we cannot use the word \"lies\" here, but the fibs that were told to the coroner's court about what happened is shocking. This would be okay if we were talking about some incident where people were out clay pigeon shooting or hunting for a day and something happened, but these were human lives. They had children, mothers, fathers and siblings. I salute Anne Marie O'Brien from the bottom of my heart. She should get a medal for her effort and tenacity in searching for justice, not only for her family but for future families that may be in this situation. Many other families have been in this situation.",
                "I know of another case that happened off the coast of Ring and An Seanphobal. There were also cases in Clare. Many cases were discussed by the committee. It was an appalling list. The Whiddy Island disaster should never have happened. They were warned about that. As I said, we must have legislation now. It behoves us as public representatives and Teachtaí Dála, if we are worth our salt, to insist that the legislation is right and to look at other international examples of best practice.",
                "The legislation makes all kinds of promises. It is nice to read and is flowery, but it needs teeth. It has to be tied down, be factual and leave no room for evasion or stepping out or going underneath the wire. It must be clearly stated. That is why I hope the Minister of State will be willing to accept some very logical and reasonable amendments from the Opposition because we are all trying to create a safer maritime seagoing experience for all of us and for families to come. We have to learn lessons and ensure that it is robust. I know there is plenty of international experience.",
                "I want to discuss the background of the current marine accident investigation framework. Currently, marine accidents in Ireland are investigated by the Marine Casualty Investigation Board. It is not fit for purpose. We need to improve the maritime framework. That is what the Government is stating in the Bill. We all want that. The Bill aims to align Ireland’s marine accident investigation framework with EU Directive 2009/18/EC. This directive establishes the fundamental principles governing the investigation of marine accidents and incidents within the EU. It emphasises the need for independent investigations to improve maritime safety and prevent future accidents. If it were not for the EU, we would not be here doing this at all. I mean that. I am often very critical of the EU but many citizens now have to go to the European courts to get justice because they cannot get it in this country. It is a sad indictment of our democracy, our public service and our criminal justice system.",
                "In comparison with other sectors, the establishment of the MAIU mirrors the approach taken in other transport sectors in Ireland. For example, the AAIU and RAIU are in place to investigate accidents in aviation and rail transport, respectively. These units operate independently to ensure unbiased investigations and enhance safety standards. We hope that is what they do. I believe that is what they would do. We have to have the exact same for the MAIU. We cannot allow the situation to continue. It has been like the Wild West for decades.",
                "The Bill also addresses the regulation of offshore service vessels and the carriage of industrial personnel, which I welcome. Ireland is a party to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea. Surely, the safety of life must be the most important aspect of life to any of us here in our duties. We are privileged to represent our constituents. The Bill aims to fulfil Ireland’s obligations under this convention by establishing a robust regulatory regime for offshore service vehicles. It is lovely aspirational language, but is the Bill robust enough? Have we sought advice from people in the know, who understand this and have done this to make sure it works properly? One of the key aspects of the Bill is the emphasis on the independence of the MAIU. Independent investigations are crucial for maintaining public trust and ensuring that safety recommendations are based on objective findings. The Bill includes provisions to safeguard this independence and manage conflicts of interest effectively.",
                "My God, that paragraph alone covers wholeheartedly the situation at Helvick Head. There was nothing, there was no investigation and the families deserve better than that. This is here as part of it but we must ensure it is robust enough, it is effective and, above all, it is independent. It cannot be got at and there cannot be a wink and a nod from anybody else. We cannot have a situation where a boat was taken into custody after two lives were lost on it and the engine taken off it and sold, swapped or disposed of. It was a disgrace that this could happen. This must be really tight. All the organisations from An Garda SIochána, MCIB and any other agents of the State such as the fire and rescue services, the ambulance service and the coroner's court must have full access to what happened. The Minister of State, Deputy Browne, recognised and saluted the rescuers in the lifeboats and, of course, we must do that but we must also ensure where a tragedy happens, and, unfortunately, accidents do happen, they will be fully, independently, robustly and honestly investigated.",
                "There are potential challenges. While the Bill aims to enhance marine safety, its success will depend on several factors. Effective implementation of the new regulatory framework and the transition from the MCIB to the MAIU will be critical. We have to have co-operation there. We often find that when people have powerful positions on these boards, they do not want to relinquish them. I know two of them are gone. I salute people who go on boards. Many of them do good work and give of their time and expertise but this area has been wildly neglected and too many lives have been lost with no accountability and families yearning for answers. Ensuring compliance with the new regulations and maintaining rigorous inspection standards will be essential for achieving the Bill’s objectives.",
                "The main objectives of this Bill are to establish a marine accident investigation unit within a timely period. I would not say it is the autumn; it is nigh on the winter of this Administration so the winds are blowing and the sands are shifting. I think the Taoiseach went to Áras an Uachtaráin this morning for some other business. People thought he was going to the country so it will not be long. Tá sé ag teacht. I hope this Bill will do what it says on the tin. I hope the Minister of State will accept any amendments and we will have meaningful discussion, a practical outcome and above all, assurances to the families of those who lost their lives. As I said, I could name up to 100 people. It is so sad. I hope their families will not be left scratching; asking questions; going from Billy to Jack to Meg to Tom to Mary and Alice; going to meet the data commissioner; and getting no answers. This is not acceptable in a so-called democracy."

                "I thank Members for their interest in the Bill and for giving their time today and at committee previously. Before I start into the substance of that, I wish to be associated with the good wishes afforded to Deputy Joe Carey by Deputy Mattie McGrath. Deputy Carey chaired the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications for the past number of years. I am sure all of us in this House wish him well in his retirement and his time beyond politics. I know he has had his health struggles so I wish him well and thank him for his commitment to this legislation when it came before that committee.",
                "A question was raised by a couple of Deputies about the timing of the Bill and whether it might conclude in the lifetime of this Dáil. I certainly hope it does and to provide the best opportunity for this, I intend to take it through Committee Stage later this month. I think a date has been set with the committee towards the end of October. If it has not been confirmed, it should be confirmed shortly and I expect to take it through before this month is out so this shows the Government's priorities when it comes to this legislation. We do want to get it through the lifetime of this Dáil and as Minister of State, I certainly want to do that.",
                "It is worth reiterating that this is a very important but relatively straightforward legislation. It take the reform of the MCIB as per the ECJ decision and as per best practice and reformulates the investigation body into the new MAIU. This is something we are obliged to do but it makes sense to do this and is in line with all recommendations and decisions. In parallel with that, we have added provisions to support the offshore service vessels to support what we hope will be both an emergent and burgeoning offshore renewable industry in years to come.",
                "I thank the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications. Unfortunately, its members are not present but perhaps they will follow the transcript later or for the wider world watching. Pre-legislative scrutiny is always useful and helpful. A number of recommendations were taken on board. The recommendation that the investigation would be fully independent from the maritime sector within the Department of Transport is now in place. A conflicts of interest framework is provided for within the legislation that also addresses that recommendation. That came from the ECJ decision and was reaffirmed by the committee pre-legislative scrutiny report. In the report, it was recommended that the definition be broadly done and this has been achieved in this legislation and these definitions - deliberately so to cast as wide a net as possible and make sure more accidents not fewer are subject to investigation. A recommendation that a chief investigator be appointed was one pre-legislative scrutiny recommendation and is now in this Bill so we have listened to the committee feedback and taken it on board and will continue to do so.",
                "A question was raised about the Lacey report and whether consideration was given to a multimodal structure that perhaps would put the aviation investigation, the railway investigation and the maritime investigation under one roof. It is important to consider the Lacey report as a product of its time. It was produced in 2009 or 2010 at a time the public mind and perhaps the Government's mind was focused on rationalisation and removing structures rather than creating them. It was a time of financial crisis. Thankfully, we are in a very different position now as we heard the Minister for Finance outline on Tuesday so it is important to have regard to that when we are thinking about the Lacey report. It was a product of its time. Notwithstanding that, there may be scope to fold in certain functions and examine synergies as times goes on but it will not be the purpose of this Bill. This is a specific legislation with a particular focus.",
                "Offshore service vessels are included for a number of years. One is to give effect to chapter 15 of the SOLAS convention. This has to be done in primary legislation. One or two Deputies queried why it is being done in this Bill. It is a good opportunity to do it. It makes sense. It is related to the legislation. It does have to give effect to primary legislation.",
                "Deputies Mac Lochlainn and Mattie McGrath raised an interesting point about whether an investigator should participate in a coroner's inquest or similar afterwards. Deputy Mac Lochlainn asked me to take this question away and I will. I will think about it and talk to my officials about it but my instinctive reaction is that we have to tread very carefully because there are rules of evidence that are centuries old and established for good reasons and evidence and material gathered for the purpose of one investigation cannot be neatly replayed before another form. You cannot just have an inquiry, conversation or interview in the course of one investigation and then just make that available to another forum because people divulge information for a particular reason under certain protections and privileges and that cannot just be transferred somewhere else without significant due process being involved. It is not simple but I will certainly look at it and see what might be possible.",
                "Deputy Catherine Murphy spoke about the Victorian age and the question of Victorian-era laws - I presume she means the original merchant shipping Acts, some of which go back to 1894 - are appropriate for offshore renewable energy. To that I would say, do not underestimate the Victorians. The Submarine Telegraph Act 1885 is still in use today and actually covers our subsea cables that carry our ones and zeros across the north Atlantic to power our data centres and our online channels. A lot of Victorian legislation is still on our Statute Book and is still used today to power new technologies so there is value in old things in many cases. This legislation will be one of those.",
                "Deputy Mac Lochlainn rasied a question about guard vessels and said it was a pity fishing vessels were excluded. I want to set the record straight on that; that is not the case. Fishing vessels can be guard vessels but they will have to deregister and re-register. A fishing vessel serving as a fishing vessel cannot be a guard vessel. According to international law and obligations, a guard vessel must be a merchant vessel and that comes with certain requirements, including that it have a load line certificate and its crew would have certain qualifications - not fishing qualifications but different qualifications.",
                "There are a number of procedures in place. Ultimately a fishing vessel can very much become a guard vessel but it must deregister as a fishing vessel, re-register as a commercial vessel and then meet the obligations and requirements of such a vessel. It is possible. Someone may not wish to do so for that reason but it is open for them to do so if they wish.",
                "There was a question about the Cape Town treaty and whether it would be considered in the context of this Bill. That will be ratified in a future merchant shipping Bill but Ireland already maintains very high standards for fishing vessel safety through our EU legislation. The Cape Town treaty is probably the next level again but thanks to the EU directives we are well covered in that area. There is an intention to ratify that but in a future Bill not this one.",
                "A question was raised about qualifications. I think Deputies Catherine Murphy and Mattie McGrath both raised it. The investigators recruited to serve the MIAU will be recruited, as is the usual procedure, through the Public Appointment Service. A prerequisite would be that a candidate would have suitable appropriate qualifications. It would not be correct, normal procedure or appropriate for myself as Minister of State to specify in primary legislation the exact qualifications that an investigator should have. Qualifications change and time evolves. There could be very good people who bring life experience to the table without necessarily having particular qualifications. There is a breadth of inputs to be taken into account when someone is being considered for a position. It is far more appropriate that it be done through the Public Appointments Service with knowledge of the skills and qualifications required rather than being prescriptive in primary legislation about one particular qualification over another. That is the normal practice in drafting. There is no question but that they would be entirely and fully qualified as they should be.",
                "The purpose of MAIU investigations is not to apportion blame or liability but to establish the facts of what happened. It is a non-prosecutorial forum. That is required by the EU directive. That is to address a few of the points that came up in the debate. I will engage with colleagues on Committee Stage, which I hope to bring forward in the next fortnight. I will not sit on it any longer than necessary. As to concerns that this would sit in the ether, certainly I do not intend that it should.",
                "The purpose of the Bill is to streamline and redefine and recreate the MIAU out of the MCIB, or perhaps out of its ashes, notwithstanding our thanks to the MCIB for its work. Ultimately, that goal, which is a requirement of our obligations and various court decisions, is being met and, in parallel, we are incorporating the offshore renewable energy piece. That is extremely important because, as Deputy Murphy said, we had originally supported Port of Cork, which received €99 million funding in the budget on Tuesday. I visited it on Friday and met its offshore service personnel. I travelled to the harbour to see the huge ambition it has and shares. Just as passionate are Shannon Foynes, Rosslare and other harbours around the country which hope to aspire to the same. I agree with Deputies who remarked that it is at the future of our future economic and sovereign prosperity. We are enabling that in this Bill. It is such an important part of this legislation that we do lean into that and we support that vision through regulation and legislation that will enable those boats to be a part of that supporting infrastructure. That is what we are doing today.",
                "I thank Deputies who made contributions to the debate. I thank the committee for its work on the Bill prior this. I look forward to further interaction on this very important legislation on Committee Stage, hopefully in coming weeks."

I congratulate both Ministers on their presentations and in particular, my colleague Deputy Chambers who presented his first budget to the House as Minister for Finance and, indeed, our deputy leader.",
                "By any yardstick, we need to stand back and look at the breadth and scale of the budget that was unveiled and give due recognition and due regard to the people of Ireland who put our country in the place where we could deliver a budget of such magnitude across so many areas of expenditure. This is at a time we can look across the globe and see the impact of globalisation, the geopolitical unrest around the world and the disruption it is causing so many economies that are experiencing economic downturns or recessions and that find themselves in economically straitened times. We find ourselves in a polar opposite situation. That is down to every man, woman and child in this country and how the country has worked its way through the past few years especially. We worked our way through Covid, bounced back strongly out of Covid with a really strong, buoyant economy so much so that we experienced, unfortunately, on the back of the war in Ukraine, a huge spike in inflation, which brought cost-of-living issues. Thankfully we were in a position to address this due to the buoyancy of our Exchequer returns. We have seen year-on-year surpluses. The prudent approach by this Government has been to provide for the future through the Future Ireland Fund and the infrastructure fund. These are two very prudent rainy day funds into which we are putting significant resources. Were we to experience a downturn or slowdown in our growth and of our economy in the future, we will have that money to call on for a rainy day fund and particularly for capital projects. If we learned one lesson from the previous economic crash and the recession that followed, it was that we lost a decade in house building. That is a great priority area for this Government. We have sought to address the huge deficit in our housing stock up and down the country. We lost almost ten years. We were constrained by the troika and by borrowing limits and the amount that we could borrow and the amount we could spend. It is a pity that during those years a mechanism was not found through which we could have borrowed specifically outside that mechanism for infrastructure to keep house building going. That was one of the big lessons from all this for me.",
                "We are in a really good situation. We do have huge challenges. We are trying to ramp up capacity in our hospitals and our construction sector and deal with issues like homelessness. We will never be without our challenges and our problems but thankfully we are in a position where we have the resources to deal with these. Our challenges relate to capacity now. We have full employment and buoyant Exchequer returns. The future of this country is in a really good place. It behoves this Government and the next and the next set of people elected to this Parliament to form a government to maintain that responsible and progressive approach to how we prudently spend our money and plan for our future despite all the challenges.",
                "I will speak in particular on the Department I am assigned to, namely the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science. It is the sixth highest spending Department with a top line budget of approximately €4.6 billion. When the Department was created back in July 2020, we set about trying to reform the further education sector in particular. Our universities were on a very good footing and in a very good place. They had a bit of an issue with funding but we have secured the funding for their future to keep them in the very positive place that they are globally and to try to improve their global and European rankings.",
                "We have revolutionised the area of further education and, in particular, apprenticeships. We will spend €373 million on apprenticeships next year, whereas we spent approximately 20% of that amount in 2020. We have revolutionised, renewed and modernised that sector and have in the region of 75 formalised apprenticeship schemes. There are about 15 more in development. Quite importantly, we have destigmatised the area of apprenticeships. University is not for everybody, nor should it be. We have given people new, innovative and creative pathways to achieving a qualification that will give them viable jobs and livelihoods for the rest of their lives. They will also receive a skill which will be transferable right around the globe.",
                "I will sum up by saying that the budget is a job well done by the Government and by the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform."

                "I want to share some of my thoughts and feelings on the budget. There are very obvious positives around the reduction in income tax for households. There has also been a small reduction in the universal social charge. Other measures will make a contribution to households in the form of one-off payments, etc., which I support.",
                "I will be quite clinical in focusing my comments on the issues facing small businesses. I represent a rural constituency that is full of towns and villages. I know just how vital it is to ensure that we have vibrancy among the businesses the main streets of our towns and villages in order to keep life alive in rural Ireland.",
                "When I speak to the owners of small businesses, whether cafés, restaurants or public houses, I discover that they are quite angry with the Government in respect of what they see is a systemic underestimation of just the level of pressure they are under. It is not just down to VAT; it is to do with the increased cost of doing business. We can look at the huge utility bills which they are being hit by. There are also other aspects such as changes to employment laws, increases in the number of statutory sick days, changes to allowances and increases in the national minimum wage. I accept that there were major issues for young people being taken advantage of, whether they were secondary or third level students, who were engaging in part-time employment. At the same time, I have to outline to the Dáil what I am being told by many decent, honest small business owners in my constituency who I trust. They tell me that they are under significant financial pressures.",
                "I am hearing that payments relating to the increased cost of business support scheme are being delayed. This must be dealt with as a matter of urgency. If record budgets are being introduced in the House, there is a need for the money raised by Revenue to be shifted from the coffers of the Department of public expenditure and the Department of Finance and put back into the pockets of those who need it the most. I take this opportunity to reflect upon that. I am listening to people and I relaying what I am being told to Dáil Eireann and to the Government.",
                "I welcome the extra money being provided to Uisce Éireann for capital expenditure purposes. People may not necessarily feel positive overall about the performance of Uisce Éireann, but there is a chronic needed to fund wastewater treatment infrastructure in rural Ireland. I spoke at last week's meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts about the village of Ballyhooly where people do not have sufficient water pressure to shower and where their washing machines, cookers, etc., cannot function properly because of the lack of a quality water supply. The sewerage facilities in their homes are not working. Before this budget, villages like that were being told that they might have to wait up until 2029 to get funding to solve these problems. That is absolutely disgraceful. It shows that we are not doing enough to get stuck in when it comes to these places in order to try to deliver the wastewater treatment infrastructure.",
                "The reason this is a good investment for the taxpayer to do this is that we can provide homes. Small builders can go in and hire five or six bricklayers from the local GAA club or other people who may not feel ready or may not want to go on to higher education or pursue an apprenticeship but who could work in construction. This is the type of grassroots recruitment of people to work in the building industry that happens in Ireland. That is why it is so important to enable the construction of homes in rural areas, whether in small villages or towns. This is something which must be addressed. There is an extra capital allocation of approximately €1 billion in the budget as a result of the sale of AIB shares. That is a very positive move. and I commend the Government on its decision in this regard. We need to use that money in Ballyhooly and elsewhere.",
                "There is fury among the public regarding the waste of public money on projects that have either gone over budget, like the national children's hospital and small things - as Albert Reynolds said, it is the little things that can catch you - like the bike shelter and the security infrastructure. I am getting many messages today about the introduction of mobile phone pouches at a cost of €9 million. The small things are really annoying people. The Government needs to be a great deal more tuned in when it comes to wasting public money.",
                "The same can be said of projects costing billions or millions of euro. The next Dáil should have a joint committee to deal specifically with the national development plan in order that we can bring in all of the relevant stakeholders, representatives of State agencies and civil servants from the Department of public expenditure and other relevant Departments and put questions to them on why projects are not being delivered on time, on budget and on scale, particularly in circumstances where problems occur. This is not to ignore the positivity around projects that have been successful; it is to address problems where they occur. That, for the Taoiseach, Deputy Harris, would be a much better idea than appointing a Minister for infrastructure."

I cannot help but feel that we have been here before. This budget reeks of the infamous 2007 budget. The so-called giveaway budget of 2007 promised everything but delivered nothing but disaster in the years that followed. We had been told that it was transformational and was the biggest giveaway in decades, but what exactly did Bertie Ahern's 2007 budget bring us? It brought us a housing crisis, economic collapse and a generation of people paying the price for the Government of the day's short-sightedness.",

We have flashy handouts and one-off payments to win votes, but no real solutions to the structural problems we are facing and the erosion of the tax base. There are energy payments going to people with second homes. Over the past three years, those people have received close to €100 million in such payments. Compare that waste of money, and that is what it is, with the false argument that happened last weekend as to whether people being paid the jobseeker's allowance would receive an extra €12. It was suggested that these people are somehow undeserving. There are 125,000 people in receipt of jobseeker's allowance. Some 72% of them on the payment for less than a year. That brings us to 35,000 people who were scrutinised over the weekend as to whether they were deserving or otherwise. A breakdown of that figure shows that most of those involved constitute one-parent families. A large proportion of those are people over 50 whose jobs became obsolete. That became the focus. That €80 million payment to second homes is for me is the biggest waste, as are the bike shelter and any of the other scandals that have come to light over the past couple of weeks.",
                "Let us look at the facts. With record breaking corporate tax receipts flowing to the State, we had the potential to do something truly transformative. Instead of investing in long-term solutions that will improve the lives of ordinary people, we have been given a budget full of temporary one-off measures that will be eaten up by this time next year. Each Minister singularly focused on their own domain, and nobody that I could see was pulling in the direction of what this country needs, namely what were the great crusades of the past and what are the simple solutions for us all collectively. The Minister of State can look up to the sky all he wants but that will be the legacy of this budget.",
                "Nowhere is this more obvious than in the area of disability services. Families all over Ireland are crying out for support. Parents of children with additional needs have been waiting years for access to basic services like speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and respite care. These families have been let down time and again by a system which refuses to provide the care and support they need. What does the budget offer them in real terms? There is cash to help them out, undoubtedly, but that will be going to privatised services and will do nothing to address the structural needs we need to cater for at State level in order to provide the type of decent and consistent accommodation that people with disabilities and their families need. What is happening amounts to an attempt at privatisation by stealth.",
                "Instead of committing to long-term investment in public services, the Government has thrown a one-off payment to families and left them to fend for themselves. That is not transformational; it is abandonment. We see the same pattern across the board. In housing, where the crisis continues to spiral out of control, the Government has chosen to subsidise landlords with a €1,000 renter's tax credit rather than increasing housing construction targets to actually solve the problem. In energy, where households are struggling with soaring bills, the Government has offered lump sum payments that will be swallowed up by the same corporations and is doing nothing to tackle the root cause of the crisis. The budget undoubtedly had the potential to be historic and to finally address the longstanding issues in housing, health and public services, but instead it is an absolute missed opportunity and in a very short space of time that will be proven to be correct. It was a budget designed to buy votes, not to solve problems.",
                "In the midst of it all we have seen €9 million allocated for phone pouches. The €9 million has become a trigger for many people across society. It had only been announced before we had educators ringing all our phones to highlight that this was the answer to a question nobody was asking. It is insulting at a time when families are waiting years for access to disability services in schools and thousands are struggling to find a place to call home. I do not doubt for a second the issue of mobile phone use at primary school level is a problem. It is one that is being addressed by parent-teacher councils and school leaders. They have been providing solutions off their own backs for the last decade or more. Despite this, we have a Minister who has decided to give €9 million and yesterday was not able to answer the question of how much each device would cost per student. The Minister said it was €20 or €30. That €9 million could have been used for a DEIS plus scheme to recognise that inequality happens on a scale and many students feel it differently from others depending on where they are. If we had invested that figure in a DEIS plus scheme, we would have got 150 extra teachers or two for each of the 70 schools that should have been included in the scheme. Instead we got the pouches and it has become a trigger point for further waste.",
                "The question we need to ask ourselves is this: what will be the legacy of a budget like this? When the money is gone and the once-off payments have been eaten up, what will we have to show for it? Will we have solved the housing crisis? Will we have built a healthcare system that supports everyone, including those with disabilities and additional needs? Will future generations have been left a fairer, more equal society? The answer is “absolutely not”. I do not doubt for a second that one-off payments will make a difference to people’s immediate lives - of course they will - but the legacy of a budget like this could have been transformational. However, the Government has chosen for it not to be.",
                "In the brief time I have left, I point to another factor lost in this budget. For the best part of two or three years I and others have been coming into the Chamber to ask for some sort of collective responsibility when it comes to the city of Dublin. We all remember how Deputies across the Chamber, when things got bad, lined up to derail the city. One Fine Gael Member referred to the city being full of drug addicts and looking dirty. The Taoiseach, when he first came to power four or five months ago, stamped on the table and said he was going to get in front of the problem. He commissioned a task force he told us would take 12 weeks to deliver its report. We are now approaching 21 weeks since he made that statement. I am very aware the task force report has been presented and the Taoiseach has not yet read it in the course of three weeks. There was nothing in the budget about enacting the recommendations of that task force. There has been more bluster and more spin. We are going to go into an election and the city will still be left without any sort of leadership. It is another opportunity lost."

In the bad times it was difficult because there was no money in the country so nobody could complain about anything. However, it is no harm to step outside the box, to use the current phrase, and examine the situation in which we find ourselves. We should be grateful that we are where we are now and that we do not have to beg for money. We do not have the IMF around the corner, we do not have it above in Government Buildings and we do not have it making decisions. We were a programme country and let us not forget it. The Opposition needs to think about that. We were a programme country so we were allowed to spend what the IMF thought it was wise to. It was here for quite a long time - the guts of five years - and it left the criteria behind it. That is something that is forgotten regularly in this House. In speeches it is no harm now and again to give a little bit of credit to the efforts made by the Government and previous governments towards recovering while at the same time trying to meet the challenges of today and tomorrow. Those challenges will continue well into the future.",
                "It is a measure of government at any time to be able to anticipate the pitfalls and be able to deal with them insofar as we can. Everybody talks about the windfall taxes. Everybody is reaching for the fruit to fall from the tree, but it does not come that easily, as the Ceann Comhairle and I know well. Accordingly, what we must plan for now and in future is stability. We must plan for the event of things going wrong. The European courts decided we were due a great windfall, but it was not really meant for us in the first place. It was meant to dissuade foreign direct investors from coming into this country. That is what it was meant to do and that is the way it was phrased and structured. That will not happen again; I can assure the House of that. We can do what we want and say what we like, but we must keep in mind that was an obstacle in our path. Incidentally, as I have said before in the House, there was a concerted campaign across the globe. It was amazing how this country, a small country, featured so much on their agenda. Mo Ibrahim, a multimillionaire, led a campaign around the world. Along with a well-known charity, he went around the globe campaigning against Ireland and saying how awful it was that we had a tax haven here and so on and so forth. He did not tell people there were equal tax havens all over the globe and in Europe as well. He was campaigning on his own behalf of course, on the basis that he was in favour of international aid and contributing to it, but it was to be aid for trade. Thus there was a barb in it, so if people traded in African countries and other less developed countries and if there was trade for his company or the companies he controlled, he would consider aiding them in a way that had a tag on it. There was no aid at all. It was just trade for trade. We just need to remember that.",
                "I wish to defuse another argument that everything the State puts its hand to is wrong and that it fails, overspends and overreaches. The children’s hospital is used as an example. I happen to have been lucky or unlucky enough to be on the relevant committee at the time it was initiated and went through all the debate that took place around it. There never was an original costing done - that is a fact - because there was no quantity surveyor’s report and it could not have been done because it was a two-stage contract and there was another one below ground and another one above ground. Nothing happened, but people began to give guesstimates, small guesstimates of less than €1 million and so on and so forth. If that can be accepted, everything is an overrun after that. We will not build a hospital of that size, scale and complicated nature for less than is going to be the ultimate price. If we want a smaller one, by all means let us have a smaller one, but if we want to have the present one we have to pay for it. We also need to recognise that in the course of doing so building costs have accelerated over the past number of years. In housebuilding alone there has been an increase of 33% in the past two to three years or whatever it is and we all know about that. We have people saying of the hospital that as builders they could build it for less. There are 6,000 consultation rooms in it. We are aware of how complicated the building of 6,000 houses is, in the market alone, and if somebody is suggesting there would be no overruns in the same period in the building of 6,000 houses I can listen to that, but I am not prepared to believe it.",

                "I am always conscious of the need for the Opposition to have bywords, catch phrases, throwaway remarks and that store needs to be built up at all times. I am happy about that. However, I do not think it is the job of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council to do that. It is right to draw attention to the fact it is dangerous to over-inflate the economy but inflation has come down. It has been either below or at 2% in the last 12 months. A lot of other countries in the eurozone and throughout Europe generally have been trying to do just that and have not been successful. The Government has managed to do that, albeit there have been other inflationary trends in our economy because of a whole series of things such as wars, Covid and all the things contributed to that. We have to deal with the issues that arise as they arise and we cannot be selective. There is no sense in the Government running away from the hard questions and saying it will deal with them another day.",
                "The Government has done an admirable job. It is a good budget. We got a lot of criticism because it makes direct once-off payments. There is a reason for that. It is not a recurring payment. In terms of the economy, which the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council is primarily concerned about, it should recognise and note that. We also need to remember that for the stability of the economy in the future, comparing it to 2007 was not a good idea. The Opposition must have been glowing with delight when it heard the phrase but it was not a good idea and it raises a question mark. The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has to do its job and in certain circumstances where adequate provision is not being made its criticism is valid and needs to be taken into account. I think the Government has kept all of these issues in mind.",
                "I will not go through the various benefits spoken about by many in this House over the last week other than to say it was a very helpful budget. In response to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, there is such a thing as social cohesion that has to be borne in mind, particularly in Europe today, where large groups of people are being challenged by the so-called moving towards the right and that the right is the future, and so on. It is not. We were there before and it was not such a nice place to be. It was not as a result of anything we did in this country but it was a really awful place to be. If we have not learned enough from the experience of the 1930s and 1940s at this stage then we have a problem. There are still those around who say things such as that the Holocaust never happened. Imagine saying that the Holocaust never happened. Thousands after thousands of people were just exterminated."

The Government needs to examine that to find out exactly what is happening to that industry because it has become wobbly, to say the least of it. There may be things that can happen within the industry. There may be things that should happen from outside the industry. Maybe rent costs are pushing the uncompetitive button. There are a number of things. Unfortunately, there is not enough time during this debate to go into those nuances but suffice to say I believe, for what little my opinion is worth in the House, that the Ministers and Government have done well. They have taken into account the areas that need to be touched and had a concern and compassion for those who need to be dealt with favourably.

I have just come off the phone to a friend of mine who was the CEO of the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament. One point she made to me, very strongly, was about the carer's allowance. Many, many senior citizens care for family members, some of whom are in their thirties, forties and fifties with disabilities and problems. When a carer turns 66 and gets the pension, the carer's allowance is cut in half. What sort of treatment or recognition is that of people who are doing a job that is absolutely needed? The means test, which should have been dropped and was not, has been mentioned many times in the House, but imagine caring for somebody for decades and when you come to get your old age pension the carer's allowance is cut in half a day after turning 66. That is absolutely outrageous and this has knocked an awful lot of older people into poverty.",

The Government's roadmap for social inclusion four or five years ago argued that payments for elderly people - people who have retired - need to be linked to 34% of the national average wage. That has never happened in one of the richest countries in the world and yet it is the norm across Europe for pension payments to be linked to the average industrial wage. Instead of getting €12 if the payment had been index-linked with the average industrial wage pensioners today should be getting an extra €31. It falls €19 short of doing right by them. We find more and more older people are falling into poverty and find pensioners struggling to survive.",

Those low-hanging fruits were the drug and addiction services in communities, the family support and youth services and the intervention services that were needed in the poorest working-class and rural communities. Those cuts have never been fully restored. Fine Gael has been in power since then but those cuts have never been fully restored.",

It is almost as if the Government has contempt. It is refusing to address the exclusion and poverty that is rampant and growing. While this economy grows, the rate of poverty is also growing among children, older people and the most vulnerable.",

I bet it will not be inspiring and the Government will continue to leave people excluded and living in poverty. That is the condemnation for this Government. Until it is gone and some other government comes in to address the imbalance, it will continue."

                "I have been listening to the debate for the past while with interest. Not too many of us, on both sides of the House, disagree about what we would like to get done. A lot of it is about how we get there. Many of us would like to get to the destination a lot quicker than we feel we are travelling. I believe that incrementally, this budget will gradually improve the lives of people.",
                "I will start with a matter I am familiar with, having spent 15 years as a teacher, which is education. I will mention the further expansion of the roll-out of free schoolbooks. It is one of those things that the Minister initiated a number of years ago. We are now finally at the destination where free schoolbooks have been extended to all secondary school children. It is something that all of us have been calling for but it has taken a number of years, and a number of budgets, to get there. I welcome that full roll-out. When we talk about helping people in poverty, it is those types of actions that will make life easier for those children and their parents by tackling the costs associated with education.",
                "We are also seeing further expansion of the hot meals programme to include all primary schools. I emphasise to those schools that have not applied for it that they should do so in 2025. I find that the people who ring our offices to give out that their school has not been selected have not applied. Whether that is because they do not have the facilities or whatever the excuse might be, I encourage the schools that have not applied for the programme in the past to do so now.",
                "I again acknowledge that the Minister has increased the number of special educational needs, SEN, teachers by a further 768 and has provided for an additional 1,600 special needs assistants, SNAs. I have spoken often about special education during my term in the Dáil. I have seen the direct impact of the interventions we are making in special needs. That includes the massive roll-out of the number of autism spectrum disorder, ASD, classes. It is important that we have the people, the SNAs and SEN teachers, to staff those classes.",
                "I will move to infrastructure. I was glad to hear that as part of the Apple windfall of €14 billion, the four pillars that the soundings suggest have been identified are transport, water, housing and electricity. It is imperative that we put an awful lot of our resources into those fundamentals. I will touch on the issue of water, which Deputy O'Connor mentioned earlier. I have spoken in the past about the problems in Cork city in particular. Replacing the mile after mile of cast-iron pipes in Cork city will cost hundreds of millions. I do not care what side of the House one is on. We can throw as much money at the issue as we want in the short term but, fundamentally, it is going to take time. Irish Water admits it is limited by its own capacity, on which there are constraints. It is good to see that is one of the areas that is going to be the focus of that Apple windfall in the coming weeks. I give a shout out for Cork city, in particular, because the area has experienced massive problems with discoloured water and excess manganese in the water in the past two years. There is funding that can be put into the treatment plants, in particular, in the short term to combat the worst of the discolouration and the water supply we have, which is not up to standard.",
                "The lack of water infrastructure is one of the greatest inhibitors to development in many of our towns and villages. I often cite the area of Carrignavar, which is a perfect example. It is only ten or 12 minutes from the city centre. It is about to benefit from the new BusConnects roll-out, which will provide a much-improved service. It is only 12 minutes' travel into the city centre for the people who are working there but there has not been a house built in the village for the best part of a decade. Judging by Irish Water's current capital plan, a house will not be built in the village until 2036 at the earliest by my estimation. It comes back to my point about giving money to things such as that. We can give the money to Carrignavar in the morning but Irish Water is telling us it will take seven years to upgrade the plant, what with planning, tendering, environmental reports and so on. That is the real crux of the matter. We can throw all the money we want at stuff but unless the system changes and adapts to the needs of society, money is not going to solve many of the issues we have.",
                "I will speak about childcare as the parent of three kids. I have a three-year-old, a four-year old and a five-year-old. Many people say to us that childcare is nearly the same kind of stress on a household as a mortgage but for many of us, the cost exceeds that of a mortgage. I welcome the expansion of the national childcare system. There will be a further 44% increase in the system and the estimates are that it will benefit most families to the tune of €1,000 per annum. That will reduce costs considerably and it is a welcome initiative. We are talking about transforming the way we do childcare but I return to my point about it being done incrementally. It will take time to massively overhaul that system.",
                "I will move to the idea of making our communities better and building better communities. Many people have spoken in this Chamber in recent months about how people feel unsafe in city centres, in particular. Dublin and Cork definitely fall into that category. While I welcome the 1,000 new Garda recruits who are going to be budgeted for in budget 2025, I must say that if we get the same number of recruits in Cork as we have in the past 12 months, it will fall far short of what we need. In the most recent roll-out of gardaí from Templemore, Cork got only four and only one went into my constituency. There is genuine concern from businesses and people in the city centre. There is a severe drug problem in Cork city centre. It is impacting people in outlying estates because there are various feuds and drug-related recriminations for people who are building up large drug debts and so on. It is a major scourge on society at the moment. While the 1,000 gardaí are welcome, I firmly believe there will have to be extra targeting of resources to combat that issue.",
                "I will also mention housing. Many parties are saying that they would scrap this and scrap that.",
                "What the Minister, Deputy O’Brien, has secured in the budget has given certainty to first-time buyers in particular, in that they will now be able to rely on the fact that the first-time buyer's grant will be there until 2029. This is a major relief to many people – they are maybe a bit younger than myself, but I was in that cohort not so long ago – who are going to purchase their first home. It is a reassurance for them that they can rely on the fact that the Government has budgeted for the grant up to 2029. In recent months, some parties in the House have modified their positions on this matter. Initially, they were going to scrap the grant, but now they say they will phase it out over three years. They are trying to adapt to whichever way the wind is blowing. Therefore, it is important to put on the record the certainty that now exists for buyers going forward.",
                "I do not believe I need the rest of my time, but it would be remiss of me not to mention business. There was disappointment in the small business community over the past 24 hours regarding the budget. Having read some of the newspapers, maybe that disappointment stems from overpromising or people trying to lead businesses up the garden path. Such accusations are being made, but whatever the excuse, the measures introduced in the budget have fallen short in addressing the expectations of many small and medium-sized enterprises. I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, to revert to his colleagues and ensure that this message is heard."

                "One of the things I remember about the cycle of the 2000s and into the following decade was that I received many delegations as a Minister in which people pointed to how we had a certain surplus. I believe the amount was €3 billion or €5 billion. That was after having put money into the pensions reserve fund. When the money ran out, though, they all questioned why we had spent so much. Such is human nature. I can understand that people’s expectations grow exponentially as money becomes plentiful, particularly when people are constantly talking about surpluses. In the greater scheme of things, we have good surpluses. However, we all know from running households that, if there are two incomes but then half of one of them is lost, we suddenly find that what was a good surplus every year becomes very tight rationing.",
                "It is important to point out that, before this budget, next year's projected Exchequer balance was to have been €9.95 billion. This figure did not include the transfer of €4 billion to the Future Ireland Fund and a further €2 billion to the Infrastructure, Climate and Nature Fund. Adding these amounts back into the overall figure would have given a real surplus of more than €15 billion. It is right that we recognise that there has been a significant turnaround.",
                "Wages are increasing, but so is inflation and the cost of living, so it is important to realise that, if the Government did not increase welfare payments and give extra tax credits, people would be going backwards. The income tax take will be larger next year, please God, than it was this year. The first amount of money is only stand-still money in real terms.",
                "Eleven minutes seems like a lot of time, but it is not really, so I will move on to the windfall. A commitment has been given that some of the windfall will be spent on necessary infrastructure. So far, the national development plan has been skewed towards the east coast, but there are urgent infrastructural needs outside of the major urban centres. The parts of the country I am referring to are the ones we can develop cheaply. There is space for people and we are not trying to cram them onto land that is very expensive to develop. I hope that some critical projects can be expedited. On the first list of early movers is a project that is ready to go, namely, the reopening of the rail line that lies between Athenry and Claremorris. This line would connect Castlebar, Westport and Ballina to Galway and provide a commuter rail service in the west. I put it to the naysayers that they were naysayers about the Limerick railway as well, but we are only getting one complaint about the rail line from Limerick to Galway, and that is that people cannot get on trains in Athenry because they are jammed. The service is poor, so we need more carriages, longer platforms and so on to meet the level of demand. We need the ring road for Galway, but it is not money that has held up that project. Rather, planning has held it up. I hope that this issue gets sorted.",
                "The other major issue for rural Ireland, be it a rural constituency in Kildare or a constituency in rural Connacht, is the importance of micro-infrastructure. Many small rural roads are not safe or up to standard and certainly do not have adequate surfaces.",
                "I have been banging on about another point for some time. We hear people talking about paying for water and sewerage services and so on. Thankfully, domestic customers do not pay for those. According to the Department of housing, 10% of houses in this country do not have access to a public water supply. For every metre a scheme is extended, it costs €300, so it is €3,000 for 10 m and so on. It gets ridiculous. It is crazy money. We need a national broadband scheme for water that, over ten years, would extend the public water supply to every house in the country. Every house should have access to broadband, electricity, water and a decent road.",

I welcome the improvement in the rates and I am glad it is the same rate this year and nobody has said that since inflation is going down, we are not giving the same rate. While lots of people getting a social welfare pension have other incomes, if they have contributions paid and are totally dependent on social welfare, living off it is difficult. Often people have nothing to fall back on.",
                "I welcome the increase in the domiciliary care allowance. I do not think we did enough in the past on this. It is still only €84 a week. It is paid by the month so it looks a little bigger but it is €84 a week. For someone with a child where there are a lot of extra costs, it is not a huge sum of money.",
                "One issue I will mention and that I will come back to when we are debating the Social Welfare Bill is means testing. I welcome the changes in the carer's allowance but you would think that carer's allowance is the only means-tested payment. In fact, it is the most generously tested means-tested payment, as those of us who hold clinics can see. There is very little reform. The Department has been two years writing a paper that we still have not seen. I will give a simple example of how crazy the anomalies are. Many of the people who do not have a non-contributory pension were small farmers or small fishermen with so low an income that they were getting farm assist or whatever and were not eligible to pay a social security or PRSI contribution. If they were in a PAYE employment and were over 66, they could earn €200 a week and there would be no means test. If they earn that from a small farm, fishing or semi-self employment, it is means tested in a vicious way that is totally unfair. Basically a euro is taken off for every euro earned.",
                "The same thing happens to those on disability allowance. We are talking about the carers all the time but nobody is talking about the cared for, the people on disability allowance, where, again, the means test is incredibly severe. Táim beagnach as am. Tá go leor eile ar mhaith liom a rá. Cuirim fáilte roimh an gcáinaisnéis tríd is tríd ach má tá go leor déanta, tá go leor fós le déanamh."

                "The first page of the budget 2025 expenditure report states: \"Sustainable public expenditure requires both the delivery of better public services, infrastructure and living standards for the people of Ireland, and expenditure to be set at levels that can be maintained over the longer term.\" That is a far cry from what this budget actually contains, a bonanza of one-off measures with very little long-term planning and nothing to provide better public services or living standards. There have been many left behind by this budget and many promises broken. The budget in many ways gives with one hand and takes with the other. The general public sees this as well. I do not think people will be bought off in this way. They see through the Government's spin.",
                "The Government has chosen to completely leave the seafood sector out of budget 2025. This shows that it has no interest or ambition for the fishing industry. Not a single cent of additional funding has been allocated to the seafood sector for 2025. This is in a week when the fishing industry is potentially facing a further 22% reduction in the north-western mackerel quotas, which will have a devastating impact on Ireland's fishing and pelagic processing sectors. This cut is a recommendation from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea and is due to years of reckless overfishing by Norway, the Faroe Islands and Iceland, as well as the UK granting access to its waters in exchange for payments. These actions have severely undermined the mackerel stock and it is Irish fishermen who will suffer the consequences yet again. There is such an injustice to it all, yet the Government refuses to stand up for Irish fishermen. It refuses to provide any further allocation of funding to the seafood sector or coastal communities that have been decimated because of the inaction of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. The seafood sector gets a small portion of funding from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The funding is so low that policy and strategy gets more than twice the departmental funding than the seafood sector does. The Government may say the seafood sector gets European funding but so do many other sectors outlined in the expenditure report, yet they still receive significant Government funding as well. Our fishing industry is experiencing a severe decline. The incredibly negative impact this has had on workers in coastal communities warrants significant Government funding and intervention regardless. The fact that the Government has refused to do this will be the final nail in the coffin for our fishing communities.",
                "We should also be supporting our small farming communities better. This budget lacks targeted measures necessary to assist farm families in managing the cost of doing business, which has increased by an incredible 73% since 2017. We need to retain the €7,000 core annual payment limit and all applicants with commonage, irrespective of parcel size or scoring achieved, should receive a participation payment equivalent to at least €120 per hectare for the first 20 ha. These are the ways that we should be supporting farm families, not handing lump sum energy credits to every household in the country, including those that do not need them. An energy credit will not make the same difference to them as it could to so many others.",
                "This is the third budget in a row that the Government has decided to do this. It has chosen to put money straight into the pockets of energy companies rather than the pockets of those who need it most. That is what the Government is doing when it is giving out these energy credits. It is encouraging energy companies to continue to hike their prices. Why would companies ever consider reducing prices when they know the Government is not only going to let them keep on increasing them, but is actually going to pay them to do it? It is the taxpayer who is paying the large profits of these energy companies. It is time to end these handouts and start putting money back into people's pockets.",
                "Instead of funding big corporations in the way we do, we should also be investing more in international aid. This is something that gets overlooked in every budget. Ireland's official development assistance does not go far enough to meet the ever-increasing humanitarian needs and crises caused by conflict, climate and hunger. Year after year, Ireland has failed to meet the international commitment to spend 0.7% of GNI on overseas aid, which was agreed decades ago and reiterated in the programme for Government. We are nowhere near reaching this or meeting our climate finance commitments. This is a year in which conflict has raged, climate impacts have continued to cause chaos and marginalised communities in the global south continue to have their rights violated. We need to do more to assist those in need across the world and particularly in Gaza, where more women and children have been killed by the Israeli military over the past year than in the equivalent period in any other conflict over the last 20 years.",
                "These are all areas in which we could be investing the €13 billion from Apple. We should be investing it in meaningful change for a better and more equal society, rather than accepting the inequalities that this Government continues to exacerbate with every budget. It does it because it suits this Government to have things stay exactly the same as they always have been, to continue giving tax breaks to the wealthy and handouts to the corporations, to continue with the privatisation of our essential services, pricing out those on lower incomes and forcing them further into poverty, and to continue to kowtow to Europe on fishing and America on Shannon. It is clear nothing will ever change under this Government, while Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Green Party remain in power. The public will see this and they will see this budget for what it is, one lacking any substance or ambition."

I have a whole two minutes to encapsulate what my constituents in Clare have said to me, namely, that this Government has failed by its own measure of success in how it treats the Clare people. There was a lot missing from this budget. I do not have time to be more balanced. If I did have more time, I possible could be, but it is all unfortunately one-sided. There is no mention of the Government's astronomical waste of money, which looks set to continue with the €9 million provided for mobile phone pouches. I presume they are coming from the same place that resulted in the Gucci bike shelter, as it is being called, the most expensive hospital in the world and the €1.4 million security hut. It could only happen in Ireland. Then we have the €2.5 billion in indemnity cases, which are set to increase to unsustainable levels.",

There should have been more targeting of those who are vulnerable in the form of a cost-of-disability payment and efforts to seriously reduce child poverty, which has actually increased. That could have been done by increasing core social welfare payments but the Government did not do that. There was no mention of establishing a model 3 hospital with an emergency department for the mid-west, no mention of the abolition of the means test for carers and no pension resolution for foster carers. We need the Leap card 90-minute fare to be extended to County Clare. Those in Kilmihil are paying a whopping €81 to get to their further and higher education courses in Ennis.",

There are insufficient nurses and the Government has tied the HSE's hands in trying to fill those vacancies as we hear that the bureaucratic process takes six months and that posts cannot be advertised until they become vacant."

                    "I had hoped the Minister for Education would be in a position to take this Topical Issue, but I was contacted earlier and it was outlined that because of prior commitments, she would not be able to. I cannot overstate the frustration of my constituents in County Clare. They notified me in the very late stages of August about the pilot school transport scheme and what the consequences were for them and their children. Since then, I have made numerous representatives to Bus Éireann and the Minister for Education and have received the same generic response each time, pointing to the fact this was a pilot scheme and that a review will take place.",
                    "This is why I am so critical of the term \"review\". I have said it is a delaying tactic, but in this respect it is preventing that necessary communication from parents directly to the Minister for Education, and even from me as well. I appreciate that the Minister has ensured that representatives from Bus Éireann have engaged with these parents, which has helped to some extent, but serious and almost dangerous decisions have been made, not to mention the cost, which I will come to later. It has been disastrous and I do not want it to be replicated in other rural areas, in particular. From what I understand, we have gone from having private contractors to children having to use public transport, but not enough buses or bus stops were in place. None of it seems to have been planned out. In the first instance, parents were told their children would have to be collected from the side of a dual carriageway. The parents have fought back and done amazing work, protesting and arriving at these bus stops at 7 a.m. before they head off to work, to ensure their children are safe. These issues were not spotted or forecast and, as far as the parents are concerned, that is completely unacceptable.",
                    "There has been a lot of backwards and forwards. A total of 280 children have had to wait at a pub car park on a busy main road that has no shelter and this is, as I said, on the side of a dual carriageway, which is completely unacceptable. On 2 September, children had to sit in threes on pairs of seats and stand in stairwells, putting their safety at risk. There was also enormous pushback from parents regarding seatbelts. As they pointed out, the Bus Éireann portal has a graphic making parents aware they need to talk to their children about putting on seatbelts because that is a safety issue, yet a bus that was provided had no seatbelts whatsoever. On top of that, there was the 316 bus, which again had little regard to road safety, and only recently Bus Éireann managed to put on more suitable and safer buses, but there has been no clarification as to whether that is going to be permanent. The parents are not sure whether, as we come into the Christmas period, the bus will be pulled or put in a different location. Being unable to discuss this with the Minister or get her support for those families, children and parents has been disappointing."

In the 2023-24 school year, more than 163,600 children, including more than 136,000 pupils travelling on primary and post-primary services, 20,200 pupils with special educational needs and 7,400 pupils who have arrived in Ireland from Ukraine, were transported daily to primary and post-primary schools throughout the country. The total cost of the scheme in 2023 was €382.02 million. More than 140,000 mainstream tickets have issued for the 2024-25 school year, which is already 3% more than the total number of tickets issued for the full 2023-24 school year.",
                    "The school transport scheme is an important service for families and children. The purpose of the scheme is, having regard to available resources, to support the transport to and from school of children who reside remotely from their nearest school. Under the current schemes, children are eligible for transport at primary level where they reside not less than 3.2 km from, and are attending, their nearest national school as determined by the Department or Bus Éireann, having regard to ethos and language.",
                    "At post-primary level, children are eligible where they reside not less than 4.8 km from, and are attending, their nearest post-primary school or education centre as determined by the Department or Bus Éireann, having regard to ethos and language. Children who are eligible for school transport and complete the application process on time, that is, apply on time and pay on time, are accommodated on school transport services where such services are in operation. Temporary alleviation measures, TAMs, at post-primary level, which have been in place since 2019, are being continued for the 2024-25 school year. Under these measures, transport is provided where a route is in operation and where capacity exists for concessionary post-primary pupils who are eligible for transport to their nearest school, are attending their second nearest school and applied and paid on time. Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport on a concessionary basis only and will be facilitated where spare seats are available after eligible children have been accommodated. Where the number of ineligible children exceeds the number of spare seats available, Bus Éireann will allocate tickets for the spare seats using an agreed selection process.",
                    "The School Transport 2030 report, published earlier this year, marks the largest review of the school transport scheme since it was established in 1967.",

The recommended changes to the future operation of the scheme include expansion of the current eligibility criteria, addressing current operational challenges and moving towards better integration with public transport to ensure the best value for money to the Exchequer.",
                    "A phased implementation of the review's recommendations began at the start of this school year. As indicated at the time of the launch of the review, this implementation includes a shared effort between the Department of Education and the Department of Transport, supported by the National Transport Authority, NTA, and Bus Éireann, to pilot and introduce greater integration of existing public transport networks with post-primary school transport routes. Two areas were identified for these initial pilot projects, one in the Limerick-Shannon area, in the Deputy's constituency, and the other in the Roscommon-Athlone area. The pilot projects in the 2024-25 school year will provide valuable insights into the scale of planning and implementation required for national implementation of a revised school transport scheme, to include the integration of public transport and school transport services. It is intended, subject to resources, to commence implementing the revised eligibility criteria in the 2025-26 school year.",
                    "Regarding the important issues raised by the Deputy, one of the pilot projects is being conducted along the existing public transport route 343 on the Limerick-Shannon-Ennis corridor. The 343 route corridor, and associated routes, was chosen because it is an established public transport corridor serving Limerick, Shannon and Ennis, which underwent significant enhancement of services from Sunday, 25 August under the Connecting Ireland rural mobility plan. Those changes coincided with the new school year. There are a number of post-primary schools on the route. Post-primary pupils involved in the pilot scheme are travelling on public transport services using their school transport ticket.",
                    "The routes in the pilot are public service obligation, PSO, routes and the necessary safeguards and approvals have been gained from the NTA. Children travel on similar public transport commuter services all over the country at peak hours, with those services being open for travel by members of the public. Bus Éireann transports thousands of children nationwide every day on public bus and school transport services. Keeping customers, especially children, safe is a core element of its culture. This extends to children availing of services both on its premises and at specific off-site locations, as outlined in the company's child safeguarding policy. A full range of passengers use these services daily, including schoolchildren who avail of existing public transport options in their area outside the school transport scheme.",
                    "Pupils on the pilot scheme have been allocated a Leap card and given a departure time and pick-up point for their service. There is enough capacity for all students at their pick-up point and the timetable has been designed to meet demand at the relevant time of the day. The pilot service has been in operation since 26 August. Bus Éireann personnel have been present at several stops along the route to observe its operation, assist children as they transition to the new services and deal with queries from parents. They have reported that the services are operating successfully. Capacity has been planned in the scheduled timetable at peak hours to cater for pupils allocated transport tickets as part of the pilot scheme. To further ensure there are no issues with large volumes of students at bus stops, departures are staggered, with specific departure slots allocated and communicated to families.",
                    "The Deputy stated that the scheme has resulted in record high expenditure on taxis for students. This is not the case. All students availing of the pilot scheme are travelling on public transport services using their school transport ticket. There has been ongoing consultation with numerous stakeholders, including school representatives, parents and politicians based in the area, in recent weeks. This engagement has led to some alterations being made to aspects of the pilot scheme, including set-down points and pick-up locations."

                    "Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh. I have a number of points on which to come back. There is no question that the school transport scheme has been expanded. Even the parents accept that this expansion was a hugely ambitious task to undertake for this September. The route that was chosen may be an established route but it underwent changes. There are no timetables on any of the bus stops on the route to assist anybody travelling on the buses. Fair enough, it took two or three weeks to get each bus service in place that was required for all the children. However, the St. Caimin's Community School bus stop is only just being finished. It was nearly finished when I last looked for an update.",
                    "The issue is not about the ambition and scale of the plan but the necessary planning that was not put in place. The Minister of State referred to the costs. I pointed out the massive increase in the cost of transportation in respect of taxis in particular. That points to the fact that in some places, especially rural parts of County Clare, it was not possible to put a bus service in place. Nationally, the cost has increased by 108%. In Clare, however, between 2020 and 2023, the cost increased by 197.5%, or just under 200%.",
                    "I am aware of the provision of leap cards, which the Minister of State mentioned. However, I am also aware that the cards were given to parents of children with special needs. One such child is only six years old. The idea of that child with special needs using a Leap card to travel on public transport is a bit crazy. That situation was rectified in the end but the problem was not spotted in the first place. That is my point.",
                    "The Minister of State said that public transport is safe. In fact, there have been increases in antisocial behaviour on public transport. That is why I raised that point."

                    "I thank the Minister of State for coming into the House to reply to this debate. This is a very emotive and important issue in my constituency. It has been going on for more than a year now. The Minister of State, to be fair to him, has been very active in attempting to come to a resolution. So far, unfortunately, his efforts have not been greeted with success, but we hope things will change very shortly because we all have to answer to our constituents. That is one of the things we have the pleasure of doing every three, four or five years, whenever it may be. In this case, I have tried to make allowances for the OPW and I have come to a conclusion. We have had weekly meetings, monthly meetings, working group meetings - all kinds of exchanges - and at the same time we have had to keep faith with the people who protested, now called the gatekeepers, and others who raised their concerns when it became obvious that what they had enjoyed in the past, that is, Castletown House and the 200 acres, approximately, of its environs, was about to become restricted insofar as their access to it was concerned. This came about when a person who purchased the adjoining property decided to restrict access to the house and put a gate across the road and so on.",
                    "The problem that immediately arises is whether the State has a right to access its property. It is a fundamental and important issue. It can be replicated again and again throughout the country in different locations. Whether the State has the right to visit and revisit its own property - not anybody else's property but property that it owns and has owned for many years - is the question. That will ultimately have to be decided legally. There may be no other way around it. People said a year ago, when this whole thing started, \"It will take too long.\" Well, as a certain finance Minister uttered in Brussels some years ago, it takes as long as it takes but it has to be resolved. That means that the State has to make the case as to whether it is reasonable to expect that an adjoining landowner may restrict the State in its access and may render the State helpless and, as a result, may allow the house, which is a protected structure, to go into decay. In the past 12 months, no maintenance has been done, the grass and the weeds have grown all over, and the house has been neglected. It is neglected because the State's employees, its operatives, have not been able to travel to and from or to go through the house in the normal way, except because the OPW decreed, or the county council decided, that there was another way, the way that was accessible 300 years ago or thereabouts, when the house was built. That was onto the main street of Celbridge, which is heavily trafficked and is an area of extreme congestion at school times because there are schools all around.",
                    "The tableau prevails. The situation is the same as it was a year ago. I know the Minister of State has in mind a number of initiatives. We do not have time now because if this Dáil session does not deal with this issue, it will not be dealt with. I would be ashamed to have represented an area whereby this kind of situation occurred and we did not or could not do anything about it. It does not work that way, it does not happen that way and it will not happen that way, please God, when the Minister of State gets to grips with it."

Deputy Andrews is opposite. When we were first elected in 2007, Mary O'Rourke was a senior Member of the House. She was very vibrant. She was that combination of intellect and robustness.

As he will be aware, when I came into office, I took over the chairing of the working group myself in my capacity as Minister of State. We have had four meetings. I had a meeting quite recently and I have a further meeting scheduled for next Tuesday, 8 October. I am endeavouring at the moment, once again at the request of the working group, to consider another access point. The chair of the OPW and I met with the residents to see if we could get temporary access, and I hope to have further engagement with the residents. I acknowledge the their meeting with us and looking at the matter. I still want to look at the broader matters which the Deputy broaches. I want to find a solution in terms of visitor parking and I continue to consider all options, including the M4 access. If we get the access I am talking about, that brings the staff back in. I note his major concern about the state of the grounds and the house. It is something we are all concerned about.",
                    "As he will be well aware, it is a policy of the OPW to reunite the historic Castletown demesne lands with the house and lands in the care of the State. The OPW has sought on several occasions to purchase the lands in question, including when the lands were offered for sale on the open market in 2022. Despite best efforts, the State was outbid on the open market and, ultimately, the lands were acquired by a private purchaser. It is the strategic objective of the OPW to reunite the lands. We remain open to negotiations with the landowners. The working group asked me to meet with them, I did so, and I expect to work towards further engagement with them very shortly.",
                    "I will take the points the Deputy raised. As regards the issue of the community, I have sought AG advice on the issue of access in all its aspects and I hope to have that advice very shortly. He mentioned the neglect. I want to get the staff back in but I want to get the wider resolution as well in terms of access for parking, and I am looking at all aspects. I believe that all stakeholders want to see Castletown estate welcome visitors and the local community back into Castletown and I want to find a resolution. I am absolutely committed to working. I have been in the role a relatively short time but I have held four meetings and I thank the stakeholders and the residents for their patience. I am determined to find a resolution, both short-term in terms of access for the staff but also more long-term in terms of parking for visitors and the public using the facility because it is a phenomenal public facility.",

It was temporary, however. I emphasise to the Minister that there is need now for a permanent solution. I know the area very well. I should know it because I live only a couple of miles away from it. I have known it all my life. If we do not resolve the issue permanently this time, it will not be resolved at all. The estate will fall into disrepair. It will be beyond repair.

As far as a permanent access is concerned, however, that is not something I am looking at.",

The OPW has a long-established policy of seeking to reunite the historic Castletown House estate.

                    "As for the Topical Issue, after a week in which the budget was announced, when the Government has finished clapping itself on the back for its give-away budget it is important to remember that 70% of prisoners in Irish prisons have addiction issues. In August of this year, ten prisoners were hospitalised due to suspected drug overdoses. In response to a recent parliamentary question I tabled, the Minister made what I find an astonishing admission - the Irish Prison Service has no full-time addiction nurse. That is pretty shocking, given the level of addiction in Irish prisons. To have no addiction nurse in our prison service is absolutely criminal. When I asked whether there were any addiction nurses in the Prison Service, it said that primary care nurses carry out specialist assessments. In its reply, the Prison Service is acknowledging that addiction is a specialist role, yet it does not employ any full-time addiction nurses. Does the Government care so little about those in addiction in our prisons? Based on the Minister’s response to my recent parliamentary question in which it was stated there are zero addiction nurses in the Prison Service, the answer is a resounding “Yes”. That sums up the Government’s view of those who are vulnerable in our society. If people have money, the Government will look after them, but if people are vulnerable in any way, it just does not care.",
                    "The Minister of State will probably say there is a nurse lead appointed to the role of addiction and mental health. However, what exactly is that person managing, given that there is not one full-time addiction nurse in the entire estate? Report after report have recommended that each prison should have full-time addiction nurses. That recommendation has been made since 2009. There are simply no drug addiction nurses despite recommendations being made in 2009, 2016 and again in 2022 in various reports. You have to ask yourself why these reports are being carried out if recommendations are not going to be implemented. What is the point in saying we need more addiction nurses when there has not been one since 2009? It is criminal from this Government.",
                    "While I know he will not have the figure off the top of his head, will the Minister of State be able to get the figure for the number of drug overdoses in Mountjoy Prison? Approximately two and a half years ago, one of the Minister of State’s colleagues asked for this information and it was not available then. Those figures are vital if the Government is serious about trying to address overdoses and recovery in Irish prisons. Why are these figures not available, given that this was flagged over two years ago? I suggest the Minister of State does not have those figures because there are no addiction nurses working within the Irish Prison Service and, therefore, it cannot provide this information. Surely those figures would be a basic and essential part of determining a strategy and a process to reduce addiction in Irish prisons. These figures, and the subsequent patterns from them, would not be so hard to find out if a process was set up within the Irish Prison Service. This is not rocket science. Why is it not being done?"

Her colleague, Noel Dempsey, withdrew the right to grant the half-day.

There are currently 19 addiction counsellors working across 11 prisons, providing an invaluable rehabilitative service to prisoners, and it is hoped that in the coming months this service will be further enhanced and refined to reach more vulnerable prisoners.",

As such, it is also striving to diversify its approach to the treatment of addiction and has been engaging with numerous organisations, including AA and NA, DCU's Recovery College initiative, and the HSE's dual diagnosis clinical programme to expand the options available and ultimately reach more prisoners. Prison nurses play a pivotal role in the provision of healthcare to inmates and show great care and professionalism across a range of fields, from primary care to mental health and addiction.",
                    "The chief nurse officer within each prison is tasked with ensuring the equitable delivery of healthcare resources to cater for the diverse and often complex needs of prisoners. There is currently no dedicated addiction nursing role within the Irish Prison Service because all prison nurses are members of the same primary care team within the prison. As such, their focus is on duties such as, but by no means limited to, medication administration, triaging, wound care and vaccination. In addition, there are a number of primary care nurses who are assigned the function of carrying out specialist addiction assessments when this is feasible, taking account of the operational demands of the prison. However, in light of the prevalence of addiction issues among the Irish prisoner population, and recommendations from the high-level task force on mental health and addiction, Irish Prison Service drug strategy and the health needs assessment, the Irish Prison Service appointed in May of this year a national clinical lead for mental health and addiction whose primary focus will be improving and enhancing clinical protocols, governance and, ultimately, the breadth of services available to prisoners living with addiction. One of the actions that may have commenced is the scoping of an addiction nurse role as part of the prison healthcare team to build the case for the introduction of an addiction nurse to provide crucial care for those most in need in our prisons.",

The evidence of witnesses physically present in Leinster House today is protected by absolute privilege, but you should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.

                "I thank the committee for inviting us here today to discuss the finding of the Irish Travellers' Access to Justice research study. It was funded by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, and the Irish Research Council and was conducted through research from the European Centre for the Study of Hate at the University of Limerick. The research team was majority Traveller and four of the six-person team are present today; Margaret O'Brien and Olive O'Reilly are the two team members who are not present. The research team was advised by a committee that was also majority Traveller and included representatives of Pavee Point, the Irish Traveller Movement, the National Traveller Women’s Forum, the Traveller Mediation Service, Minceirs Whiden, the Department of Justice and An Garda Síochána. The research team's findings are ground-breaking in providing for the first time a comprehensive, human rights informed portrait of Travellers' perceptions and experiences of the criminal justice system.",
                "The team conducted lengthy survey interviews with one in every 60 adult Travellers in Ireland and conducted 29 interviews with people working with Traveller organisations nationally and regionally. We found that Travellers see themselves as suspect in the eyes of the police and the courts, simply because of their ethnicity. They experience over-policing as a community and under-policing as victims of crime. We provide robust evidence of a pipeline to prison, fuelled by racial profiling, a disproportionate use of stop and search powers, including shockingly common searches of Traveller homes, and concomitantly high rates of arrest. Some Travellers described police provocation, in particular of young men. In court, Travellers report indifference to the barriers the community encounters around accessing justice.",
                "They perceive that Travellers are guilty until proven innocent. There is a disproportionately high number of Travellers in prison for minor offending. In recounting their most negative experience with judges in the past five years, a key theme which arose in our research was the belief that Travellers receive disproportionately high sentences compared to their settled counterparts. It is important to say that we found evidence of good practices also among members of the police and the Judiciary but these were the exception rather than the rule and dependent on committed individuals, not on institutionally embedded practice.",
                "We welcome this opportunity to discuss both the findings of the report and the State’s responses to those findings in the two and a half years since its publication. In recruiting participants to the research, we made a commitment that this research would not sit on the shelf, but that we would advocate for action on the findings and recommendations. Since the launch of the report, we have presented to two United Nations committees, the Council of Europe, the Policing Authority and Garda Ombudsman, representatives of An Garda Síochána, the EU Subgroup on Equality Data, the District Court judges conference, the steering committee of NTRIS and the Department of Justice. It is disappointing, therefore, that the State has yet to adopt or act on the recommendations of the report in any meaningful way. The report offers a comprehensive range of recommendations. Today, we would like to highlight three recommendations of the research."

                "The first recommendation is to introduce an ethnic identifier throughout the criminal process. Equality data is essential to tracking disparities in how groups are treated in the criminal justice system, promoting fair treatment through accountability and developing remedial policy and procedures. In the absence of official equality data, both the Garda Commissioner and representatives of the State have denied findings of both ITAJ and EU Fundamental Rights Agency, EUFRA, research that speak to the existence of racial discrimination against Travellers in the criminal justice system.",
                "At a meeting of the Policing Authority on 30 June 2022, the Garda Commissioner responded to questions about the racial profiling of Travellers prompted by the ITAJ research by stating:",
                "I don’t believe we do undertake racial profiling ... Racial profiling is a very serious allegation to level against An Garda Síochána and before I would accept that I would want to be certain on the reasons why I was accepting that allegation.",
                "A month later, at the 92nd session of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, a representative of the State responded to a similar question by stating:",
                "There have been questions of racial profiling. Racial profiling is not a feature of policing in Ireland. It's not compatible with the human rights obligations of An Garda Síochána, but there have been tensions between particular communities and the guards.",
                "The second recommendation is for the development of a criminal justice strategy for the Traveller community. The Department of Justice Statement of Strategy 2024-2026, published this year, omits any reference to Travellers, Traveller ethnicity, ethnicity, racial profiling or racism and sees access to justice being operationalised through a “faster, more effective justice system”. In her foreword, the Minister states, “we will uphold the fundamental right to fair and equal access for all”, but there are no objectives or outcomes linked to this other than a reference to improving access to “vulnerable users”.",
                "The National Traveller and Roma Inclusion Strategy II 2024-2028, in contrast, summarises findings of the Irish Travellers Access to Justice research and of the 2019 EUFRA Traveller and Roma Survey with respect to ethnic profiling and acknowledges the need to address the over-representation of Travellers in prison and low levels of trust in An Garda Síochána. The associated actions include many important recommendations, including with respect to diversion and alternatives to prison. They do not, however, address themselves to policing practice or to the courts. We assert that actions to achieve equal treatment by criminal justice agencies must include interventions addressed to the operation of criminal justice agencies.",
                "The third key recommendation was to develop a robust and independent complaints mechanism operating across the criminal justice system. There have been significant changes to complaints mechanisms with respect to both police and courts since the publication of the ITAJ recommendations. The impending launch of Fiosrú, the new GSOC, is very welcome. The Garda Ombudsman’s office has already evidenced a commitment to engaging with the Traveller community and requested a presentation to its caseworkers on the ITAJ research. The particularly low levels of trust, literacy and digital literacy, as well as particular experiences of racial profiling and exceptionally high rates of searches of the home, necessitate a bespoke approach to the needs of this community. We hope Fiosrú will consider these matters in developing its public awareness functions and in developing the accessibility of its complaints mechanisms. Since the publication of the ITAJ research, a mechanism has been established by which a complaint can be made regarding judicial misconduct. This is also a very welcome development. As in the case of Fiosrú, it is important that the complaints mechanism is publicised and functionally accessible to the Traveller community.",
                "With respect to accountability and transparency, we are concerned that neither the police nor the judicial complaints mechanisms produce any equality data with respect to the identity of complainants or the treatment or outcome of their complaints. Equally, we are concerned that neither process meets human rights standards of being independent institutionally, hierarchically and in practice. A key reason Travellers do not complain is the fear of retaliation from those who are the subject of the complaint. We suggest that processes be urgently put in place to address this issue.",
                "We ask the committee to, first, reject the normalising of Travellers’ over-representation in the prison system and to understand it, not as an inevitability, but as an outcome of systemic racism including in the criminal process; second, acknowledge the need for equality data to address disparities in treatment and to build trust in the criminal justice system; third, advocate for fully independent complaints mechanisms that are functionally and universally accessible, as well as trustworthy to users; and, finally, recognise the urgency of State action to disrupt the pipeline to prison. We thank the committee."

I remember one of the most striking quotes from our Traveller interviewees.",

The common experience is to be treated as \"less than\" or the \"lowest of the lowest\". These are both direct quotations from interviewees. The difficulty concerns the extent of the required practices, which should be embedded in any judicial system and in policing and which are probably experienced by many members of the Irish population. The statistics show that, in general, our population has quite a good relationship with the police and, to a slightly lesser extent, the courts. There are quite high levels of trust in both, but that is not translating through in the treatment of the Traveller community. This means we need equality data. If policies are not being implemented coherently and consistently in practice, we have to be able to track it, identify it and deal with it. That means equality data must also relate to complaints. Complaints about mistreatment and poor treatment will also be important in pulling the system back into line and making it accountable to those not receiving the same service and access to justice as everybody else."

That report was followed up with a review. It is a matter of consistently collecting data. The one area where England and Wales fall down regarding their equality data concerns Travellers and Roma; however, there is a model for how this data can be collected, processed and published, and for how the trends and patterns it refers to can be attended to, highlighted by and addressed by the state through successive monitoring reports over time.",

That is the starting point. We cannot start to address a problem while we deny it exists. We have to start by acknowledging that racism, specifically anti-Traveller racism, is endemic and embedded in Irish society. We know this from repeated public attitude surveys and surveys of employers. Fifty-seven percent of employers would not employ a Traveller full stop, just because the candidate is a Traveller. We know this from the education system. We know the problem is embedded in all institutions of our society. Why would the criminal justice system be exceptional? If we do not start from the point of recognition and acknowledgement, we cannot move forward."

The racism Professor Haynes spoke about seems to have got worse in recent times. In the past, Travellers were part of society and had a niche, like those in other areas, and they worked in various areas. However, much of the economy they were involved in changed with the advent of plastics and mechanisation, including farm mechanisation.

The Deputy hit the nail on the head in that the economy of the community has been obliterated by the approach of modernity, including through the mechanisation of farming and the use of plastics in modern society. As tinsmiths and weavers, Travellers played a huge role in rural society, travelling from fair to fair to provide a service that was quite important to the local economy. Travellers were among the first recyclers in this country and were heavily involved in scrap collecting and the recycling of copper, tin and aluminium.",
                "One thing that people miss about Travellers is that they were seasonal farm workers. They were often a very welcome sight on farms because they provided cheap and accessible labour for many farmers when harvesting and planting. They usually helped with tillage farming but also with livestock, although very rarely. The onslaught of modernity and the mechanisation of farming from the 1970s onwards turned us from pretty much rural people into urban people. With that, we started moving into urban centres. We were of an oral tradition rather than a literary one, so we lacked the skills that many in the settled community had, meaning reliance initially on social protection. With regard to falling into poverty, the circumstances have kind of been recreated, with economic marginalisation. There was a difference in understanding between the settled community and the Traveller community in that respect. The Deputy really hit the nail on the head in that not being useful economically has led us to being left behind in many ways."

There has been a shift in the living circumstances of Irish Travellers, particularly from the 1960s onwards, and in the relationship between the settled community and the Traveller community. However, even at that there was still a deep embedded divide within society at that time. We can look at the Dáil debates, for example. Under the Local Government Act 1925, power was given to local authorities to remove \"tinkers\" from the local area because of the health and other nuisances that tinkers were causing to the local community. It was not in the 1960s that this attitude towards our community began. It was there already, embedded into society from the anti-nomadic perception the settled community had. You can also look at that process from the foundation of the State of moving away from the general identity that Irish people were stereotyped with globally. We can look at the words used for Irish people in general - the drunken Irish, the fighting Irish, the backwards, uneducated and dirty Irish. All of these terms that were placed upon Irish people in general, immediately after the foundation of the State, were put onto us as a community. The sense was that, when Ireland was looking at nation building and creating a national identity to be respected, a scapegoat was needed in society so we could say, \"We are not them, this is the uneducated, backwards and drunken Irish, not us.\" The divide begins there.",

Research has been done and surveys have been taken on public attitudes and from An Garda Síochána. In each survey it is the stereotypes that keep coming back over and over. That keeps us in this vicious cycle."

He found that gardaí who had contact with members of the community had a much more favourable view of Travellers than those who had no contact. Where we see a community as distant and different from us, we think of them as different. We have completed a public attitudes survey in the European Centre for the Study of Hate, which measures social distance across a range of community groups. It will come as no surprise to the Deputy that the levels of absolute discomfort with Travellers from the general population are relatively high compared with other community groups.

From a human rights perspective and the Council of Europe, the first step is acknowledgement. As Professor Haynes said in her opening statement, the Garda and the Department of Justice continue to deny the existence of racial profiling. If racial profiling did not happen in this State, we would be unique internationally. Our police service would be unique internationally if we did not engage in racial profiling. Not only that, the Garda Commissioner used language in the Policing Authority that he did not believe racial profiling was a feature of An Garda Síochána. I do not know about others, but I heard that as the Garda saying it did not believe Travellers. The data is there. We spoke to one in 60 Travellers. Of those we spoke to who were stopped, 58% said they believed the reason they were stopped was because they were a Traveller. This data is almost precisely replicated by the previous study by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights in its study on Roma and Travellers in Europe. It found that 59% of Travellers who were stopped believed that they were racially profiled. The difference is 1%. I am not a social scientist but even I know that data is robust.

It is directed towards trying to ensure that prison is the option of absolute last resort for that community. The system, as it is implemented in Canada, is not perfect. It is a federal system. Different states approach it differently and resource it in different ways.

It is up to the criminal justice system, particularly those who work in the criminal justice system, and the responsibility of the State to earn and build the trust of the community. Trust-building requires recognising that there is systemic racism embedded within our institutions. Without that recognition, we are not going to move further forward as a society."

Making a complaint to the Ombudsman takes much longer than it used to. The processes are much more complex. We keep adding to the processes. Most people get worn out by the system. If I might say so, people who are not as digitally involved find it harder to keep with the pace. This is why people from disadvantaged backgrounds often seek the assistance of a TD. It is because we will do the work for them. This might apply to means testing. The first port of call must be to try to eliminate the need for a complaint. This is the easiest solution for everybody.",

A large part of this comes back to accountability for the person and to protection. A fear of retaliation by a judge or garda, or by the Garda or the Judiciary, came from the participants in the research. This was a key reason for not using the complaints system that is in place. It speaks to a lack of trust in the systems. It also speaks to a belief that nothing would come of it. It is important to say the lack of awareness of how to begin the process of making a complaint came up a lot. While the structures are there, there is a lack of trust in them, there is a fear of retaliation and there is a lack of awareness of them. All of these need to be addressed."

A judge against whom a complaint is made will be told the identity of the complainant before it has even been determined whether the complainant is legitimate enough to be considered. With regard to the police, we still have a system where police investigate police. Even under the newly established Fiosrú and under the new legislation, an unknown proportion of complaints will simply be delegated to An Garda Síochána for it to investigate complaints about itself. How can we ask a community that already feels overpoliced as suspects and underpoliced as victims to trust a complaints process where their identity will be known and where they will be investigated by the people against whom they are making the complaints?

Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative they comply with any such direction.",

Lucy was the senior administrative officer with responsibility for pensions administration at the relevant time. She is retired from the Central Bank and is accompanying me here today in a personal capacity.",
                "I joined the Civil Service on 12 November 1973 and became a member of the \"original\" spouses' and children's contributory pension scheme, which was compulsory for new entrants. In 1988, when I took up a new position in the Central Bank, there was a discussion between the senior pensions administration in the bank, the Department of Finance and myself, present, about the transfer of my service, including pension contributions from the Department in which I worked. During that comprehensive discussion the Department asked about my age, checked again and again whether I would ever envisage any benefit to myself under the scheme and then, taking all of that information into account, made a reasonable decision that they would refund the contributions directly to me in this case and not transfer them to the bank, given that I was never likely to benefit from the scheme.",
                "The position taken by the Department of Finance was a case of, the officer read between the lines, there were no personal positions identified or divulged, but everything was understood. The refund from the Department of Finance was indicative that I would never be entitled to the benefits of the spouses' and children's scheme. I stayed in the Central Bank pension scheme as I was not prepared to “out” my personal orientation. Homosexuality in Ireland was not decriminalised until 1993.",
                "Following the passing of the equality referendum in May 2015, and to ensure the entitlement of the same-sex couples to benefit from an occupational pension scheme, changes were made to Part VIIA of the Pensions Act 1990, as inserted by Part 3, section 27 of the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registrations Act 2018. Section 81L sets out the conditions for entitlement. Subsection (1), part (ii) states that the member married or entered into a civil partnership with that person within 36 months of coming into operation of the Marriage Act 2015 or the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010. The legislation was sponsored by the Minister for Social Protection.",
                "The changes in this law were adopted for members of the Civil Service pension schemes and were contained in Circular 18/2020. The title of the circular was Recognition of same sex marriages/civil partnerships under Public Service \"Original\" Spouses' and Children's Contributory Pension Scheme.",
                "On 24 September 2023, I applied to be reinstated in the \"original\" spouses' and children's contributory pensions scheme as provided for in Circular 18/2020. On 4 June, I received a formal response to inform me that my application had been refused because my civil partnership had not taken place before 1 January 2014 as required by section 81L(1)(c)(ii) of the Pensions Act 1990. I entered a civil partnership on 14 April 2014. I missed the boat by approximately four months.",
                "I will set out the critical timelines. June 1990 saw the passing of the Pensions Act to provide for the fair treatment of men and women under occupational pension schemes. May 2015 saw the passing of the equality referendum. December 2018 saw the passing of the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Act, including changes to the Pensions Act 1990. November 2020 saw the issuing of Circular 18/2020 by the Department of expenditure and reform.",
                "I will set out the critical issues. The 2018 Act laid down conditions under which a person who was a member of the \"original\" spouses' and children's contributory pension scheme and had left the scheme could apply to rejoin it. These changes gave recognition to same-sex civil partnerships and marriages for the purpose of entitlement to contributory pensions, including those in the public service. One of these conditions was the that the applicant must have entered into a civil partnership or marriage within 36 months of the coming into operation of the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010, whose commencement date was 1 January 2011. Thirty-six months on from 1 January 2011 was 1 January 2014. Critically, the changes to the Pensions Act 1990 were only adopted by the Oireachtas in December 2018 and Circular 18/2020 was not issued until November 2020. The 36-month condition in respect of same-sex partnerships had expired on 31 December 2013. When the 2018 Act was adopted, the conditions had already expired by five years. When Circular 18/2020 was issued, the conditions had expired by seven years. Circular 18/2020 was issued to the staff of the Central Bank on 3 July 2024. Part VIIA of the 1990 Act, relating to the 36-month requirement, is flawed, discriminatory and possibly unconstitutional.",
                "Before concluding, I wish to make some observations about the response by the Department of Social Protection to my petition. According to the Department, the circumstances specified in section 81L to be satisfied are that the member of the scheme must have entered into a marriage or civil partnership with the other person within 36 months of the coming into force of the relevant legislation recognising same-sex relationships in Ireland, and since these were transitional provisions, it was necessary to specify a period of time within which the scheme member must have married or entered into a civil partnership to be deemed to specify the scheme conditions. It was not necessary. The only necessity was to name the spouse and provide proof of the civil partnership or marriage. These conditions have never applied to non-same-sex couples.",
                "The Department also stated that to have introduced these provisions in respect of same-sex couples without specifying a period of time could have given rise to unequal treatment for opposite sex couples. This is utterly disingenuous and deeply offensive. The only people excluded from the cover of occupational pension schemes are same-sex spousal persons and their children. The Department stated that a three-year period was considered to be a sufficient and wholly reasonable time period for a scheme member in a committed relationship to regularise his or her marriage or civil status by marrying or entering into a civil partnership. I have proven that the time period was neither sufficient nor reasonable. In its response, the Department failed to recognise the flawed, discriminatory, unreasonable and unconstitutional anomalies contained in the legislation. How fair and reasonable was it to introduce legislation in 2018 that created conditions for same-sex couples who wanted to avail of pension entitlements but backdated those conditions to 1 January 2011 for a restricted period of 36 months, thereby making the required conditions unattainable in 2018 and beyond? The legislation is flawed in meeting its objective.",
                "In the final paragraph of its response, the Department stated that any question relating to the granting of access to schemes, in respect of persons who were not members of the schemes, that provided entitlement to spousal pensions was a matter for the Department of Public Expenditure, NDP Delivery and Reform. The passing of the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Act 2018 led to the issuing of Circular 18/2020 by the Department of public expenditure on 30 November 2020. Circular 18/2020 contains the same flawed conditions as set out in the legislation. The Department of public expenditure and reform, or the Central Bank in my case, does not have the right to change the law even if it is fatally flawed, discriminatory, unreasonable or unconstitutional. In a phone call with the director of human resources in the Central Bank following the rejection of my application for reinstatement, I was told that, if the law was changed, the bank would apply the law."

There was some administrative delay in that transfer happening, so I contacted the Department of Finance. The occupational part of Mr. Moran’s service was transferred directly and the only contributory part related to the spouses and children’s scheme. A question arose as to whether that sum was going to be transferred to the Central Bank. In the conversation we had with the Department, it transpired Mr. Moran was very unlikely, in the circumstances, to ever benefit from the scheme and, therefore, the Department took the decision to repay him directly for those years of contributions while he had been at the Department. His position at the Central Bank was such that he remained a member of the spouses and children’s scheme and he had those refunded on his retirement. Otherwise, we would have had to make a different case in the Central Bank not to allow him, because it is a compulsory scheme."

The responsibility for pensions appears to have been vested in the Department of Social Protection. It affected a change to the Pensions Act 1990, which was the governing Act in respect of equality for men and women in occupational pension schemes. It was the appropriate area in which to insert an expansion of the understanding of occupational pensions.",

If we add the 36 months to the starting date, we end up with January 2014, in the context of an Act that was introduced after the referendum that nobody in 2010 would have known was ever going to happen. It introduced that, and the further anomaly related to the 36-month period for the operation of the Act applying to same-sex couples who married after 2015. For them, that 36-month period went up to 2018, so that was another implicit anomaly.",

How can we say the law is being applied with openness and transparency if we create a conditionality that applies to the law in 2018 and is backdated to 2010? The only way this can be dealt with sufficiently is by simply removing that one sentence in the Act that lays down the 36 months. If that were removed, there would be equality of application of the law."

He has come to a public committee to tell his story about this. The way he has been mistreated is extremely unfair. I could use stronger words but I would be in trouble. It would be very unfair to the parliamentary public as well. I will certainly look into this to see what we can do to remove this. I do not know whether it will cause another knock-on effect. The Oireachtas has the resources and an amazing library and research crew. I will approach them to ask whether it can be done. We can even do that through the committee. If we know it can be done, they can assist us in making those changes and trying to get it through. That is the only thing we should be doing.",

If transitional is the issue, transitional should be attached to the Bill itself stating that the provisions of the Bill have a 36-month period, which is open to people to apply. Transitional conditions cannot be imposed retrospectively, thereby making the actual legislation inaccessible. That is simply what those provisions have done. All I want is equal treatment.

The petitioner applied to be reinstated in the original spouses and children's contributory pension scheme as provided for in circular 18/2020 with a response stating that the application had been refused because the civil partnership had not taken place before 1 January 2014, as required by section 81L(1)(ii) of the Act.

We also spoke about another couple of people we need to talk to who would be well tuned into what is going on.

We support women in that journey through change. We are a women’s rehabilitation project, and all of our programmes are designed with a gender lens on addiction.

I hope that through this story, we will have a shared understanding of what is needed to support women. I wish to introduce the committee to Davina, which is not her real name. Davina is a 35-year-old woman who is also a loving mother to her beautiful son and daughter. Davina grew up in a home where she experienced multiple forms of violence and abuse. Her father was an alcoholic who would regularly beat her mother while Davina watched in terror. He had also abused her from a very early age.",
                "As Davina grew up, she began hanging with friends and like many people she experimented with substances which then led on to cocaine and heroin. She never thought she could become dependent because many of her friends did not. Maybe her friends had not experienced the same traumatic experiences that she did, and Davina soon found herself using more because it helped her suppress the pain she was feeling from her childhood.",
                "Davina met her partner Dave, who is the father of her first child. Dave was confident and strong, and she thought she had finally found somebody that could take care of her and protect her. Within two months of meeting Dave, she found out she was pregnant and Dave began treating her differently. He would beat her and isolate her from her friends. He also began injecting heroin and soon introduced Davina to the needle too. She was scared at first but her addiction to heroin was severe and it was much cheaper to inject because she would need less. She then began committing petty crimes - Davina, not Dave. He had her committing petty crimes such as shoplifting to feed both their habits, and even though she was the one paying for it she then still had to wait for Dave to get himself together to have the first hit and all that, before she would actually get a turn. That put her at further risk because a lot of the time they had to share a syringe. It was getting later in her pregnancy, and she started to worry about her unborn baby, so she started a methadone programme and was doing fairly okay.",
                "Let me tell the committee about how well she gets on when she tries different treatment and rehabilitation agencies. Davina was attending the DOVE clinic in the Rotunda Hospital and instead of being yet another mother who was waiting to welcome her baby into the world, she experienced stigma and discrimination at the hands of the people who were supposed to be there to support her. Every urine test she provided was tested for drugs and she felt scrutinised if she happened to have a sleepless night, which many women do. Many pregnant women find it difficult to sleep. If she looked in any way tired, she was asked what she was taking, and she experienced all the other pieces that come along with that, which other women generally do not experience through their pregnancy.",
                "Davina would be tired and have to face a barrage of questions. She was always honest but always felt doubted. She had her son and faced the dreaded monitoring of her baby which all women on methadone or using substances do, where every sneeze, cough and tremor their babies have - like any other baby - is charted and scored as if they are competing for the Eurovision. The nurses are not specifically trained in addiction either, so many would give her dirty looks when they were filling in the scoresheet, making the already worried mother feel like a failure.",
                "Davina was not allowed to leave the hospital with her baby as the baby was showing signs of withdrawal. Davina wanted that child home so badly that she decided to try to get more help for her addiction. She put a care plan in place which consisted of some support services and Tusla. After her son got well, she was delighted to take him home.",
                "Davina tried the drop-in service for a short time and Davina was happy because it was the only place available to her with her son, but she felt many of the staff were constantly asking questions about the baby and her relationship with Dave, and never focused on Davina's needs. They also offered her unwanted advice about parenting as if she was incapable, they were pulling her up about every little thing and making her feel like she was doing things wrong. She wanted support for herself but felt that it was about everything else but her and she also felt that if she talked about or disclosed what was really going on, she would be judged as a mother, so again, she felt stigmatised.",
                "Davina tried a CE scheme. The CE scheme that Davina started was like many other addiction-specific schemes in Ireland. It was predominantly male and Davina found it difficult to open up or be honest about everything in her life. Many of the issues she was experiencing were things it would be easier to talk to women about because she felt that men could not relate to her. Some of the men also displayed traits of toxic masculinity and constantly flirted with her, which made her feel even more unsafe. There were also no childcare facilities, so she could not fully commit to the service. She decided to drop out.",
                "She and Dave had got a flat together, but they slipped back into addiction. This was around the time of Covid and she could not earn money from shoplifting because many of the shops were closed due to lockdown. Dave encouraged her to turn to sex work. She was terrified. This brought all the trauma she had buried to the surface. She would be out until late at night and then go get their heroin. They were also using crack cocaine by then. They used it together and, as usual, Dave would go first, but when the drugs were gone, Dave's jealousy about her sleeping with other men would come out even though he had forced her into it. One night, he left her so battered that a neighbour called the police. When they came, instead of being treated as another woman would be in that situation, she was made to feel like a complicit victim and as if, somehow, his rage was partly her fault. Tusla was called and her son was taken into care.",
                "She left Dave and tried to get into a women’s shelter but, because she was a woman who had used substances and was on methadone, she could not get a shelter and ended up sleeping in a friend's home. She was there without her son. At the time, she was extremely vulnerable and this friend, who was a male, took advantage of that. They began a relationship that was also toxic. She also found herself pregnant again. This time, Davina got the strength to leave him. She did not stay with him and went through her pregnancy alone. She tried residential detox. She could not concentrate because she was worrying about her son. All she wanted was for her child to be with her, but she felt that she was being punished for all the trauma she had experienced in life.",
                "She blamed herself for ending up in yet another situation like that. She did not know that victims of such abuse are vulnerable to it happening many times in their lives. This is why she really needed a female-specific service where she could finally begin to heal. She finally began a female-only service where she began to build an analysis of what her life had been and what were the contributing factors. She also had her baby girl. She was just on methadone at the time and her baby was born healthy and happy. With the right supports, there was finally a trajectory plan put in place, and Davina got her son back home with her. Now, she wants to come off methadone in a residential centre that caters for children, but she can only take one with her, and only the youngest. The thought of leaving her son again is too hard for her to bear, so she is waiting until she is in a place where he feels secure and her children are old enough to understand her making those decisions.",
                "Society treats women who use substances as less than, and this feeds into how they feel themselves. Women are under-represented within treatment services and policymakers can sometimes miss the clues and not ask the right questions. There needs to be gender-specific services that are trauma-responsive. They need to be not just trauma-informed but to actually respond to the trauma that women experience. We need to create supports that are tailored to the complex intersectional needs of women, instead of them being an add-on to services that are made for and predominantly used by men. Women's health and societal needs are different from men's, so they require a gendered lens and more funding for services that also provide childcare.",
                "I will also highlight that I read something the other day about 1,100 new prison places. There need to be alternatives to prison, specifically when we talk about women. The issues women have do not get fixed in prison. I firmly agree that nobody should be in prison for petty crimes anyway, but when it comes to women, we have to look at the damage that does to a family as a whole rather than just putting women in prison. That should always be a final alternative, with every other avenue having been explored first. I thank the committee."

                "I am the CEO of Merchants Quay Ireland, MQI. I thank the Cathaoirleach and members of the committee for the invitation to speak here today.",
                "Merchants Quay Ireland is a registered charity providing a wide range of services to people who are in addiction and who may also be experiencing homelessness or be struggling with their mental health. Last year, over 13,500 people came to Merchants Quay Ireland for support. Our services range from harm reduction needle exchange to prison counselling, family supports and recovery services. We provide low-threshold day services offering crisis intervention, food, showers, harm reduction and primary healthcare. Our healthcare service includes a doctor, nurse, dentist, counsellor and mental health team, as well as chiropody. Merchants Quay Ireland offers residential detoxification, rehabilitation and aftercare services, which are aimed at supporting people in their recovery journey. We also run Jane’s Place, an all-female service offering one-to-one and group support to women dealing with complex issues of homelessness and addiction.",
                "As a front-line service working daily with people who are homeless and struggling with their mental health and drug problems, MQI is an expert in the field of addiction. As such, we are well positioned to contribute to the debate on drug use in Ireland. In our submission to the Citizens' Assembly on Drugs in June 2023, Merchants Quay Ireland proposed 24 evidence-based recommendations. We believe the implementation of these recommendations would ensure a health-led response to drug use that would, in turn, reduce the harmful impact of illicit drugs on individuals, families and wider society, and would also support more people into recovery.",
                "Due to time constraints, I will summarise MQI’s recommendations as follows. First, we recommend increased investment in recovery services. We need to provide people with greater access to residential and community-based detox, rehabilitation and aftercare programmes. Importantly, people leaving these programmes must have access to secure accommodation. Nobody should be facing homelessness in the early stages of their recovery because it makes an incredibly difficult journey an almost impossible one.",
                "For those people who want to access recovery but who are struggling in active addiction, MQI recommends the establishment of a rapid access stabilisation service and the appointment of specialist addiction nurses to emergency departments.",
                "To support people using drugs today, we recommend increased investment in harm reduction services. The opening of the medically supervised injecting facility later this year at MQI’s Riverbank centre will be a vital harm reduction measure. This facility will save lives and help to create a safer community for everyone. Drug use in Ireland is constantly changing and, given the increased prevalence of cocaine and crack cocaine, MQI recommends legislating for the provision of drug consumption rooms.",
                "MQI also recommends that the Government introduce legislation to decriminalise the possession of drugs for personal use. Decriminalisation, coupled with increased investment in treatment and harm reduction services, will give people the best opportunity to rebuild their lives.",
                "MQI recommends increased investment in drug-related research. Given the growing complexity of drug use, research is crucial to responding effectively to future challenges and emerging drug trends.",
                "To meet the complex needs of women in addiction, MQI believes the State must invest in female-specific services. Women often feel too ashamed, stigmatised and afraid to seek the help they need. Female-only spaces give women greater emotional and physical safety, especially those women who have experienced gender-specific violence, transactional sex and coercive control.",
                "Ensuring a compassionate, health-led approach to drug use will also help to reduce stigma. This is important because stigma is one of the biggest barriers to treatment and recovery and can make it difficult for our clients to ask for help when they need it. These recommendations, if implemented, have the power to save and transform lives.",
                "Drug use is pervasive throughout Irish society, regardless of age, gender or socioeconomic status. Every day, MQI witnesses the harmful impacts of drug use on individuals, families, communities and our wider society. It must be acknowledged, however, that areas of poverty and social deprivation are significantly more impacted by drug use and drug-related intimidation. We believe it is vital to maintain focus on the prevalence of addiction and to adopt a compassionate health-led approach to delivering services which reduce harm and support recovery. The national drugs strategy, which forms the current policy background against which the committee considers these matters, is fundamental to addressing the needs of the most vulnerable in our society.",
                "On behalf of Merchants Quay Ireland, I look forward to today’s discussion and I hope our professional insights relating to the committee's work will prove useful."

                "Substance dependence represents a significant public health challenge globally, affecting millions of individuals, their families and communities. People use drugs and they always have. Archaeological evidence has identified drug use by humans dating back tens of thousands of years. Drug use tends to emerge during adolescence, a developmental stage marked by experimentation and sensation-seeking. Most young people who use drugs stop or engage in less risky drug use as they move into adulthood, but some young people develop problematic relationships with drug use which leads to them interacting with other systems, such as child welfare and justice.",
                "The majority of adults who use drugs do so recreationally and, depending on the substance they use and the route of transmission of that substance, they may not experience any harm. Harm can be viewed as physical, psychological and social. Physical and psychological harm within recreational drug use primarily occurs when there are contaminated and synthetic substances within unregulated markets or in the way in which people use substances. For example, smoking cannabis comes with the risks associated with smoking, whereas ingesting cannabis in other ways has reduced risk.",
                "Social harm occurs when drug use is criminalised. In these situations, contact with the criminal justice system can be viewed as a social harm. A criminal conviction carries with it a stigma, with consequent barriers to education, employment and housing. This places individuals at further risk of social exclusion, which is detrimental for both physical and mental health. There is often an attempt to view these issues as a simple linear process, that drug use leads to negative outcomes. There can be a failure to see how a range of systems interact with one other. For example, a minor conviction for drug possession limits a person's future opportunities and prevents that person reaching his or her full potential. This can generate cycles of problem use.",
                "When we speak about drug use in public domains, we focus on the people who are experiencing chronic substance dependence, estimated to be between 10% to 25% of people who use drugs. This will also be the focus of my submission but it should be noted that people who use drugs in a non-problematic way are at risk of harm from a system that punishes them and increases their risk of social exclusion. The UN Human Rights Office in 2022 stated:",
                "Data and experience accumulated by UN experts have shown that the “war on drugs” undermines health and social well-being and wastes public resources while failing to eradicate the demand for illegal drugs and the illegal drug market. Worse, this “war” has engendered narco-economies at the local, national and regional levels in several instances to the detriment of national development. Such policies have far-reaching negative implications for the widest range of human rights, including the right to personal liberty, freedom from forced labour, from ill-treatment and torture, fair trial rights, the rights to health, including palliative treatment and care, right to adequate housing, freedom from discrimination, right to clean and healthy environment, right to culture and freedoms of expression, religion, assembly and association and the right to equal treatment before the law.",
                "In my current role and my previous role in the community, the focus of my work has been with people who are involved in chronic problem drug use and understanding why a cohort of people develop a different relationship with drugs. People take drugs because of the effect it generates. Mostly, people take drugs and it generates pleasure, but for some people the purpose of their drug use is to medicate overwhelming emotional pain. The way in which we understand the trajectory of this use has evolved. Traditionally, there was a view that drug dependence was a moral failure and a choice. Research data, however, now indicates the majority of people engaged in substance dependence had a pre-existing mental health difficulty, experienced social exclusion and-or had experienced traumatic events. The Health Research Board has identified that while drug use exists at similar levels in affluent areas and areas of economic deprivation, the harm experienced by people who already experience social disadvantage is greater. Financial and social resources are, therefore, a protective factor in preventing drug dependence. Our research in applied psychology has indicated that people who have experienced traumatic events are at increased risk for problem use and there is a cumulative effect to this risk. The more trauma an individual experiences, the greater the risk of problem use. Other findings of note from our work show that people with the highest levels of trauma histories are more likely to self-report their mental health difficulties and do not have an objective diagnosis. This group struggle to access services and are frequently viewed as difficult instead of traumatised. People with substance dependence have frequently experienced a range of social and psychological harms and have co-occurring mental health difficulties. I believe drug dependence is a mental health issue and should be managed by health services.",
                "We know from decades of research that people use drugs, people will continue to use drugs and punitive approaches have not decreased this, yet we continue to follow a policy that generates no effective results. Measures such as incarceration have been shown to be largely ineffective in reducing drug use and they exacerbate health problems. These measures fail to address the underlying issues that lead to substance dependence, such as mental health disorders, trauma and social disadvantage. Further, the stigma associated with criminalisation can prevent individuals from seeking help, leading to increased health risks. Understanding drug use as a mental health issue shifts the focus from punishment to treatment and recovery. This perspective acknowledges the complex interplay between substance use and mental health disorders and underscores the need for integrated treatment approaches. By addressing the root causes and providing comprehensive care, we can improve outcomes for individuals struggling with addiction and promote better mental health across populations.",
                "Ireland has the highest level of drug-related deaths in the EU and it stays in the top three. I will go back to the train station today and I will see young people there who are drug dependent. Sometimes I talk to them. A lot of them have care histories and have experienced trauma. I know some of those young people will be dead before Christmas."

                "I thank the committee for inviting me to share my perspectives and research findings and engage with members on the topic of a health-led approach to drug use and policy in Ireland. Today, I will be discussing the research output of Service Users Rights in Action, SURIA, which is a service user-led group that campaigns for rights-based methadone maintenance treatment and other forms of opioid substitution treatment. One of our principal objectives is to recognise service users as consumers and partners as opposed to passive recipients of public healthcare. As such, we advocate for a symmetrical partnership dynamic to inform the doctor-client interaction in both clinical and GP settings. I am referring exclusively to methadone care here. We also advocate for a review of the overuse of urine sampling and the promotion of dignity and respect, with a renewed emphasis on re-integration, to inform any health-led response to drug policy and practices pertaining to opioid substitute therapy treatment in Ireland.",
                "SURIA and my own research argue that Irish methadone maintenance treatment, as an example of harm reduction, often paradoxically produces harm in the lives of clients. We highlight the lack of progress in clients' lives, poor reintegration, the overextension of power into the lives of clients, including in matters that have little to do with drug use, and the poor quality of life for those who expected to be helped by methadone services. There are currently approximately 12,000 people availing of methadone services in Ireland.",
                "My own research, and that of SURIA, is routinely underpinned by the service-user narrative and experiences of those engaging with opioid substitution treatment, OST, primarily methadone, using a human rights perspective that traces the progressive realisation of rights instruments pertaining to the highest attainable level of healthcare, that is, Article 12 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, among a number of other rights instruments. Our rationale for this approach stems from the fact that methadone is a public health service and therefore clients should enjoy the same rights and treatment as others who are accessing treatments for other illnesses.",
                "The current profile of the Irish service users suggests that many are trapped in clinical settings with little opportunity to engage with society in a meaningful manner. To give a brief overview of this cohort, according to SURIA's research, I will go through some points. Some 66%, or two thirds, are aged 35 years or over; almost half have been engaging with OST or methadone maintenance therapy, MMT, services for up to ten years; one fifth have been using methadone maintenance treatment services for over 20 years, and one in ten for over 26 years; and 83% are not engaging in employment or education.",
                "I wish to reiterate that I am not critiquing the amount of time people are spending on methadone services. That is their own choice and it is a perfectly fine choice if that is what they want to make. What I am highlighting is that people are trapped in these clinical settings for long periods of time, where they do not have a high standard of life and poor opportunities to enter, or sometimes re-enter. We talk about reintegration; sometimes it is integration we are talking about here.",
                "SURIA research continuously demonstrates that those using methadone services often allude to institutional stigma - that is, stigma from within services - poor treatment practices and not being afforded any input into their own service provision. This briefing is underpinned by five datasets. SURIA has been carrying out this research since 2012. It is a longitudinal monitoring of how methadone services are provided to service users. We are tracing the progressive realisation of a number of rights instruments, with a particular emphasis on the right to health. As part of this longitudinal research approach, our work has repeatedly highlighted that these services are substandard, stigmatising and often harmful for those seeking refuge from problematic drug use.",
                "SURIA’s work is underpinned by four key principles that have continuously emerged from our research. They include supervised urinalysis, the lack of a care plan, choice of treatment and meaningful review, and the absence of any form of an independent and robust avenue for complaint for clients who are coming across issues in their service provision.",
                "SURIA is not the first to draw attention to the shortcomings of the Irish methadone system. Apart from a number of research articles that illustrate the poor practices, inept training and other failings of methadone services in Ireland, the HSE itself commissioned the publication of the Farrell report back in 2010. This was an independent evaluation, funded by the HSE, of methadone services in Ireland. The report was a damning indictment of Irish services and suggested that MMT was entrenched in urinalysis. The practice of continuous and relentless testing embodies the infantilisation and perception of surveillance that many clients allude to. However, it is the over-reliance on testing that advances this critique. Urinalysis is used to routinely test service users and to restrict heroin use but SURIA's prior work demonstrates that urinalysis is not just an important facet of contemporary methadone services in Ireland; rather, the entire service is predicated upon the result of a test.",
                "We have come across service users after collecting qualitative data across our five longitudinal tests and this statement always stands out to me. I remember a woman saying to me in an interview, \"I do not even think my doctor knows what I look like because when I go in and see him, he stares down at the screen, and my whole progress, my whole dose and my takeaways are all determined by a sample on whether I am drug free or, like the language used in the clinics, clean or dirty.\" This becomes internalised. If you get told you are dirty every week, that is going to have severe ramifications. What we are talking about here is meaningful engagement with service providers.",
                "I wish to allude to some of the reservations I have from my own personal experiences and those of others I have encountered in a decade of research on Irish methadone services, and this is around the pivot to a health-led response. I believe it is crucial that a health-led response is clearly defined, drawn from international literature and best practice, and underpinned by the contemporary evidence base. I would caution about the overmedicalisation of methadone services, considering that addiction is a complex nexus of factors, many of which are associated with low labour-market engagement, low educational attainment, and generational socioeconomic deprivation and poverty.",
                "An overemphasis on health has the potential to undermine reintegration into society. Recent SURIA research explicates that 83% of our research participants, from a cohort of 337, are not currently in employment or education. While I see the health-led approach being really beneficial in taking drug use away from the criminal justice system, I believe we need to reassess that when we are talking about methadone services because it could potentially turn into an even greater emphasis on urinalysis and testing, and less emphasis on reintegration and quality of life. These are the most important things for methadone care.",
                "It is crucial that methadone services are holistic, addressing all aspects of addiction and promoting recovery in all its forms. This should be underpinned by a clear move away from continuous sampling, with standardised care plans alongside meaningful review of treatment. This should replace urinalysis as the principal tool of determining the trajectory and conditions of treatment.",
                "The continued employment of control through sanction, again underpinned by urinalysis, does little to promote dignity and respect. This is particularly evident in the use of language by service users throughout our five reports. Many participants express a desire to be “clean” - that is not my language - which suggests that they were once “unclean” or “dirty”. This is the language that is routinely used by services, and by those employed to form therapeutic relationships with clients. Instead, the asymmetrical power imbalances that we repeatedly discuss in our reports are still central. The normalisation of poor, non-evidence-based treatment leads to internalised low expectations of anything being different from the service user's perspective. SURIA research is an avenue for these unheard voices to be brought into the policy landscape, like they are today. Some examples of qualitative data we have collated from service users include: “I am [being] treated like a scumbag junkie”; “I can’t get a job because I have to go to the clinic every day except Christmas ... when it is closed”; and “I hate the way people look at me differently [when I walk] ... into the clinic”.",
                "It should also be noted that Irish methadone services are inhibited by poor practices, a lack of training of staff and a resistance to follow international best practice and literature. I wish to reiterate that methadone is not the primary problem here as a medication. Methadone does what it says on the tin. It is not perfect. Every service user who enters that arena is well aware of this. It is not perfect but it has the potential to change lives if people are trained properly in how to prescribe and treat service users.",
                "I am almost finished. SURIA research has continuously captured a life in which vulnerable people are regularly dehumanised, disempowered and have arguably been forgotten by stakeholders who are responsible for their care. As Irish harm-reduction services still fall short in the realisation of the highest attainable level of healthcare, our public health sector continues to hurt, punish and blame many service users who are homeless, have experienced trauma and struggle to navigate a world of frenetic competition during a cost-of-living crisis. To continue to do so casts a dark shadow on Irish society. For Service Users Rights In Action, the current Citizen’s Assembly on Drug Use in Ireland will be considered a failure if the plight of Irish methadone service users continues to be overlooked.",
                "Again, I thank the committee for inviting me today and given the extent of the issue, I urge members to consider the evidence-based points I have made today. I would be more than happy to answer any questions the committee might have when everybody else has finished speaking."

                "I thank the Chair and members of the Oireachtas committee for the invitation to this session on a health-led approach. My input draws from my work experiences. I first commenced work in this field in 1976 in Ballyfermot, and have since worked in the south inner city, the Ana Liffey Drug Project, and in Dún Laoghaire.",
                "I have also researched policy issues and commissioned other research and have been involved in training people on the front line. My experiences are recounted in my book The Harm Done: Community and Drugs in Dublin, which concludes with the need for substantial legal reform.",
                "The assembly's terms of reference specified, inter alia, that it would make recommendations on legislative changes. Of the 36 recommendations, only recommendation 17 refers to the prospective need for legislative change - in this case for decriminalisation. It is my overall contention that this committee should go a step further than recommendation 17 to recommend legalisation and regulation and that it should advocate a single public health framework for managing drugs and alcohol together into the future, as currently happens within several EU countries. I outlined a number of points to assist the committee's deliberations, as per the written submission, which I have cut back a little for time purposes.",
                "A discussion on the health-led model should always differentiate drug use from problem drug use. Most people who use illegal drugs regularly do not need health interventions, although they experience other problems arising from their legal predicament. For perspective, the largest substance use problem in Ireland is alcohol use disorder, estimated at a staggering 578,000 people. Health-led schemes are not new. Others include custodial treatment, the drugs court and adult cautions for cannabis, initiatives that have either lacked implementation or had little overall impact.",
                "Recommendation 17, as it stands, would also have little impact as it would simply transfer procedural tasks from the courts system to the overburdened health services.",
                "Rather than simply adopting the assembly report, I urge the committee to ask why recommendations continuously do not get implemented. I refer to the other 35 non-legislative recommendations in the assembly's report, most of which have previously been recommended, some of which have been implemented and a lot of which have been abandoned. Rather than reiterate old ideas, therefore, the committee should focus on the need for new legislation and a new departure.",
                "Internationally, public policy on drugs vacillates between two contrasting perspectives, namely criminal justice and the health-led model. The justice perspective prevails. Its enforcement negatively impacts social determinants of individual health such as housing, neighbourhood support, education, income, unemployment and friendships, thereby exacerbating all the key tools in health-led interventions. This needs to change.",
                "Front-line addiction personnel are confronted with a dilemma: should they follow the criminal justice model, get people drug-free and thus crime-free, or should they focus on harm reduction and accept that their clients will continue to use drugs but more safely, while knowing also that because harm reduction is often unpopular electorally, they risk being accused of giving in to the war on drugs and not having enough drug-free, crime-free client outcomes? This dilemma creates overbearing tension and pressure on the front line, where morale is hugely affected and frequently undermined. This is all mirrored in the lack of security and proper terms and conditions for people who work on the front line.",
                "Within the health system generally, drug addiction is seen as being outside the mainstream of hospital and community services and mental health services, and little progress has been made in getting mainstream services to participate in the normal treatment of drug problems. A parallel rather than integrated system has been in operation for more than four decades.",
                "The major drug programme within the health-led sphere, methadone maintenance, as summarised by Dr. Healy and backed up by other research, including that by Paula Mayock and Shane Butler in Dún Laoghaire, has consistently shown these services to be unsympathetic to clients. In contrast, where people develop health issues arising from the legal drug alcohol, the health system responds differently, without moralising or stigma. The same normalised approach towards alcohol is needed in respect of use of all drugs. Stigma will not go away by redefining the meaning of health-led. Legal change starting with cannabis is needed, especially as cannabis has least negative impact on morbidity and mortality. Members might not know that cannabis was not referred to once in the recent report on drug-related deaths and it accounts for up to 80% of illegal drug use.",
                "In the briefing material attached to my opening statement, I summarise the main elements of a pragmatic public health approach to alcohol and drugs together. This type of framework, which is used across the other health issues, is important for understanding that progress on overcoming drug and alcohol problems requires integrated interventions at all three levels of the public health system: primary, secondary and tertiary.",
                "I urge the committee to concentrate on the bigger picture and focus on asserting the State's role, not through continued prohibition, nor through simply sanctioning limited health-led initiatives, but through legislation and regulation in accordance with the health risks of individual substances, with taxation and proper enforcement. The war, which tends to be fought out in the more vulnerable places, needs to end.",
                "I am happy to take any questions or comments. I again thank the committee for the invitation to come here."

More than anything, we need to state that. We cannot state it enough.

Then they are groomed into carrying drugs by guys who they think love them and, because of their home background and their emotional vulnerability, they mistake what love is. Part of it is a strategy because gardaí often travel as two men walking so they cannot search a woman if they do a stop-and-search or anything like that. We are all probably on the same page in our views on the merits of stop-and-search. Young girls are being groomed and then it is only a matter of time before they go down the Davina route, and it is important that we intervene.",

These titles were not deliberately linked, but they spoke to what was happening. I will speak to methadone services. Access to methadone is much better than it was a couple of years ago when there were waiting lists of months or years, but of 12,000 people, few are making the transition into the workplace or education. As part of its decriminalisation model, Portugal is incentivising employers to employ people with addiction issues. This will go a long way towards changing culture and making treatment more acceptable, in that someone will not have a stigma attached to him or her when trying to enter the labour market or education. Incentives along those lines would go a long way towards helping reintegration. We are discussing long-term issues – culture will not be changed in a single budget – but there are steps we can take to get it started. That would be a good thing. There should be a greater emphasis on reintegration instead of keeping people in long-term care. I have cited the statistics. There are people who have been on methadone for 26 or 30 years. It is not a problem if that is what they want to do, but with Ireland’s current services, there is nothing else they can do. If people are on methadone, it is difficult to get educated or enter the labour market, as they must give urine samples three to four times per week and collect their methadone three to four times per week or even every day. They cannot be seen in the workplace or education. Therefore, we have this stigmatisation and almost discrimination of methadone users."

While there is a need for integration among those who work within the specialist system so that they work together on providing continuity of care, and a framework has been in place for more than 12 years that supposedly facilitates that – it is called the national drug rehabilitation implementation committee, NDRIC – I do not believe there was any reference to it at the citizens’ assembly, primarily because it had not been rolled out properly. There is a framework for the agencies on the front line to work together, but in the absence of engagement with the mainstream, every single element within the specialist sector that requires a mainstream segment just creates another specialism, leading to there being many fragmented specialist services within the addiction arena. Guiding this is the fact that, overall, people working in mainstream services do not want to work with people who are caught up in illegal behaviour. That is a large part of the problem."

People may have an illness or a family member may have an illness and they are trying desperately to get seen. That is just a small part of it but it is a simple example of how we stigmatise drug users and categorise them as people who could change their situation if they wanted to. As the committee spends more time listening to people, we get to understand there are deep-seated psychological and trauma issues underlying drug addiction.",

A lot of it was illegal and highly dangerous. Somehow in the early stages of the State, we managed to put a control system in place. Some people gave out about it but over time it worked and became regulated. I would start with the drug that is easiest, cannabis, because there are many international models in place. It would be a game-changer if we managed to get on top of that.",

I expect that within approximately ten years there will be large industries dealing with the manufacture, distribution and sale of those drugs. There will be a huge demand among the industries that supply those drugs to extend their markets into Ireland and other places. At that stage, it may be impossible for the Irish Government to resist that because of European competition law. I believe the Government needs to get on top of that issue at an early stage and start with cannabis. It needs to get on top of it in such a way that it is not leaving it to the market. We have recently seen how the Government has been behind the curve regarding vapes, which I know very little about other than the private market has set the pace with the distribution of vapes in Ireland. It is only more recently that the Government has begun to try to put a regulatory framework around it but it may be too late for that.",

Ms Kearney referenced people having to shoplift and engage in criminal behaviour to maintain - I do not like to use the word “support” - an addiction they are experiencing. Decriminalisation will not help these people, who will still have to engage in criminal behaviour to maintain their addiction. They may carry larger or smaller amounts for personal use because part of the transaction and part of their personal use is minding drugs, holding on to drugs, passing on drugs or distributing drugs to other people. Personally, I believe decriminalisation will benefit the middle class and people who use drugs at the weekend, who can afford to buy their drugs and spend €200, €300 or whatever it might be out of their disposable income, and they will continue to do so with impunity. However, people who are in very difficult situations will still engage in criminal behaviour.",

The vast majority of them are not big drug lords. They are people who have chronic addiction and have ended up in prison primarily because of their addiction and the criminal behaviour resulting from that addiction. While our objective might seem very progressive, I am not sure we will reach the outcome we hope to reach or that the people who are most affected and most marginalised by drugs will see any change in their lives."

One of the things that happens is that someone might start a process of a recovery journey and then, due to a past arrest, has to go to court, the charge goes through and they get a sentence. When talking about women, not only are they focusing on the impact on themselves when they have to be in custody for three or six months, but there is also the utter destruction that causes to the family unit, given that women are still more responsible for the family unit.",

The effort of trying to stabilise drug use or becoming drug free is very difficult for people, particularly when it is linked with other ongoing issues. For example, a woman in recovery will be managing her trauma and that will be rising for her as her drug use is falling, so she will be trying to manage those two things together. When society says it does not really care what she is doing, it will put her in prison anyway, it just throws a lot of that up. A lot of the motivation and the hope just dissipates. You undo loads of work that way."

It was very uncomfortable for me but it was very degrading for the person who had to produce the sample in front of me. Dr. Healy just brought me back to that. To me, it was sometimes a pointless exercise. I did not think there was a need for it. When we first moved with methadone from a detox-based programme to a maintenance programme, the problems started happening then. I am from a disadvantaged community. I have friends, people I grew up with, people I am still friends with and some people who are no longer here, who would have been put on methadone at the age of 13. Some of them are still on methadone, some are not and some are no longer here. It is different for different journeys. They often describe being on methadone as being in liquid handcuffs because you have to be at a certain place at a certain time. The goal was, which I always thought was a false goal, to go from having daily methadone and going to the clinic daily, to twice a week, to weekends and then the goal was to go to the doctor and get a prescription. That was seen to be the whole thing and I felt there was very little done about getting help for people who wanted to come off methadone and start over, because so many barriers had been put in place.",

Urine analysis should be taken away altogether. There is no empirical evidence that it does any good. Ward, Mattick and Hall have produced literature that it does not deter drug use in any way. I know as a former service user that it certainly did not stop me. It costs between €5 million and €7 million a year to test samples. That money could be put anywhere else. The key is a good therapeutic dynamic between you and your doctor, who knows you and what you want, and that you are being properly dosed. We have this stereotype of a methadone client who is walking around the inner city and the boardwalk stoned. Let us just use the word stoned. That is not methadone. Methadone does not impair how you feel unless you are abusing it in some way, adding on street tablets or whatever. That is usually done because the staff are not trained properly. That is accepted by the doctors I know who work in the HSE and who actually train people themselves.",

It really reinforced my view that it is the correct approach to people who inject drugs or, more importantly, people who use drugs. Obviously, our legislation is about an injection facility as opposed to a consumption room. It is a complex area. It has been in planning for eight years. There have been many objections, many of which reflect people's genuinely held beliefs. There are many concerns about what a facility like this could do to the local community. We have tried to engage as openly as possible with all our stakeholders, including business, local residents, the school and various other stakeholders in the community, about how the service will look and what way it will operate, and to dispel as many fears as we can about this notion that it would be a honeypot for all those who inject across the city and country. That is not the case. The international evidence would demonstrate that these are local facilities used by local people who use drugs. We do not envisage any other outcome here other than what we have seen in other jurisdictions.",

The most recent statistics show that 439 people died of drug poisoning in 2020. The highest number are people who overdosed on methadone. A total of 129 people in 2020 overdosed on methadone. Methadone is a legal substance. It is prescribed. It advances the need for health-led facilities where people can come in and be monitored and supported. Naloxone or whatever we need to administer can be administered in a timely fashion when a person goes into a state of overdose. It is a facility that I have urged people to be patient about and to judge it on its outcomes as opposed to on perceptions about it."

I thank the witnesses for their opening statements and all the work that they and the organisations they represent do. I heard some of the witnesses' earlier contributions. I was listening before I went to the Seanad. The witnesses were talking about stigma. It certainly resonates. I come from a perspective that if we want to change stigma, we need to change the way that we as a society think about addiction. We need to accept that addiction is just a symptom of trauma, pain and disadvantage. I guess as a culture and a race that we have generations of that trauma, from the Famine to economic depression, to social repression, the Troubles, the crash and Covid. That trauma is part of us as a race. Not all of us can cope as well with that all the time. As we get older, coping and recovery are so much more challenging.",

How early does the intervention need to be made? I think Mr. Mullins, or perhaps the Prison Service, spoke to us about how 70% of those in custody finish school before 14 years of age. That means that before 14 years of age, they have disengaged from society. Society has allowed them to fall by the wayside. Some 80% of those in custody have an addiction. How early does society need to make the intervention? We need to identify that, pinpoint it and call it out. If, as a State, we start to do that, that will start to address the stigma and change society's view of what addiction is. That is one question.",

On decriminalisation, Mr. Mullins pointed out that the middle class will probably get the benefit of it, whereas for people who are working class or come from disadvantaged areas, it might make no difference, and that made sense. We are looking to make a change here on foot of the citizens' assembly. The war on drugs has not worked. Everyone knows that now. What can we do, therefore, to make a difference? It is our job in the Dáil to legislate. There has been a lot of food for thought. On a political note, I was very disappointed that the word \"addiction\" was not mentioned in yesterday’s budget. A citizens' assembly made 20 recommendations for more investment or supports and there was not a bob in the budget for it. The question I am asking today is what stage we are at here. The witnesses spoke about investment and about how, when money was put into youth services and they were targeted and supported, benefits were seen.",

                "Daniel Callaghan recently finished his PhD, and I have looked at various aspects of that. When somebody dies as a result of drugs, it is called a bad death. In bereavement, there are good deaths and bad deaths. The former is one relating to a natural cause, whereas the latter is one associated with stigma. Families who have been bereaved as a result of a drug-related death do not get the same sympathy. It is as though their son or daughter made that choice. That is what we used to say about suicide 20 or 30 years ago but we are still saying it about drugs.",
                "Moreover, this impacts not just families but also communities and workers. People who work in front-line services, especially out in the community, develop very long-term close relationships with the people they support, and when they die, they are devastated. They also experience it as a bad death. It does have an impact. We have an issue with recruitment and retention in front-line services, especially homelessness and addiction, because people get really burned out from the demands outweighing the resources.",

                "The Deputy asked what we are going to do about it and when will we intervene. This is fundamentally about structural inequality. This is fundamentally about the fact some people experience more harm from their drug use as a result of poverty and classism. In the UK, the British Psychological Society wrote a White Paper on why classism should be added to the list of discrimination. People from working class communities do not get the same access. Members could probably count on one hand how many are from working-class communities. They are probably the ones who are coming in here and turning up to these kinds of events, because people who are not from working-class communities are not experiencing the same harm. We do not even have equal representation in the context of the people who make policy and formulate the rules. Someone who has not experienced poverty does not understand things like it being cheaper to tax a car for 12 months than for three. The people who can only afford to tax their car for three months are penalised by the State for having less money. That is the State. I can understand when private companies do that, but we could stop them. Buying a card for €10 to top up my electricity meter costs more per unit than it does for a person who can take the risk of having a direct debit coming out of their account. We think poor people are bad at managing their money, but we make it really hard to be poor and to get out of poverty. When you are poor, it causes poor mental health. People sometimes people use drugs and alcohol to manage that."

We know drug trends are the way they are. We know cocaine and crack cocaine are big issues. Perhaps when we review this 18-month pilot - there will be a comprehensive report on its outcomes - the one in Cork should be a consumption room as opposed to a medically supervised injecting facility.",
                "I have a point to raise on the medically supervised injecting facility. It is an important aspect of drug treatment, but recovery, detox and aftercare are the main ones. We see people who go through a detox or recovery programme and into aftercare and how they have rebuilt their lives and their connections with their families and that is where we really have to concentrate. There is a chronic addiction issue, but there are barriers to people getting into recovery every day of the week. The cost of a ten-week detox programme with Merchants Quay is approximately €10,000 to €12,000. It is nearly double that to keep somebody in prison. We can provide detox followed by a 12-week recovery programme, then aftercare and then obviously on to stable and suitable accommodation. That can transform a person's life, and not just theirs but their family's as well. I showed Senator Fitzpatrick a letter I received from a lady in a part of Dublin. She had lost her daughter to suicide. Her daughter had addiction issues. Through all that grief she was writing to me to thank Merchants Quay for the support it had given her daughter. The last thing she said was she would send us a few bob when she had it. This woman clearly does not have a few bob. I know from her background she does not have a few bob. I am thinking of the connection she had with and the empathy she had for people in addiction. She saw recovery as the key to that."

However, with the evaluation at the end of the 18-month pilot period, we have to lodge another planning application in order to continue. That opens up planning appeals and objections again.

I am wondering about service users' rights and how we get those. Now we are talking about decriminalisation, one of the changes it might bring around is that a drug user is not immediately a criminal. It would change the context we are all having a conversation in and the mentality of trying to catch people out would be removed. That might be a significant benefit when people are seeking treatment. I want the witnesses to talk a little about the gender side of it as well. On service users' rights, are we missing a trick when it comes to things like peer-led systems? How can we optimise that? Surely all the focus on testing runs completely contrary to people's rights because, ultimately, it is not really consent based."

We trained up other service uses who designed the survey with us as well as carrying it out and collecting the data. I wrote it up and then ran it by everybody. We had some meetings about whether they liked what we were doing. We launched that research in the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission. It was a small launch with about 100 people there and about 30 service users who were involved. It was a real empowerment piece. It was really beautiful to be a part of and see service users standing there saying that this was what they wanted to hear, that this was what they have been saying and that this is their voice being heard by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission. These were people who have never even been to these buildings and who do not feel like they belong. We were seeing them standing up and really feeling part of it. That empowerment piece is massive because not only are we empowering service users to be agents in their own social change, we are also producing credible, reputable and brilliant findings to inform policy. The unfortunate thing is that these findings, which SURIA has been repeatedly launching - five times, as I stated earlier - are not making it into the policy landscape. The funny thing about this is they are being used in other countries. The UK is using SURIA research findings to review its policy."

It reminds me that at the time there was seriously bad alcohol around that is not around today. Some of it comes back to common sense, pragmatism and believing that young people - because they are the ones most at risk - can differentiate between products. They have shown themselves to be able to do this with heroin and other opiates by choosing to use cannabis rather that getting stuck into heroin. The fall-off in the use of heroin over the last 20 years has been incredible. We can copy aspects of the alcohol model, particularly regarding regulation of the types of products available, the licensing systems, the type of outlets, availability to young people and so on.

Not everyone who has ended up in substance dependence has experienced trauma, though a large number have. We have not looked at this yet, but we potentially have many older men and women who are in addiction who have undiagnosed autism or other neurodivergence. We live in quite a social country where people have to go the pub to drink and if they do not, there is something wrong with them. How many men and women of the 1980s and 1990s were alcoholics as a result of us not understanding that? People have to change and adapt to the culture around them by drinking and that will have a totally different impact.",

Sometimes that is because, as Ms Kearney said, they cannot look for help if they are mothers, because their children might be taken away from them. The other thing we know is that women who are entering menopause are drinking more because menopause is having a detrimental impact on their mental health. These things cannot be easily separated. There was always a view that drug use caused mental health problems, but actually a huge study by Kessler et al that looked at thousands of people found that the majority of mental health issues start before the age of 18 and the majority of substance use dependence diagnoses happen after the age of 18. Studies of cannabis use and youth mental health were mentioned earlier. Correlation is not causation. If someone comes to a service and says, \"I had psychosis\", these are the things we do not know. If I go into hospital tomorrow and am having a psychotic incident and I am tested for drugs - which we rarely do because if someone says they have used cannabis and that is why they are psychotic, we accept it - we will not always know whether it is one of those new psychoactive substances. I might test positive for THC, but there might have been something contaminating the cannabis that we do not know about. We therefore have to be very careful about how we interpret information and the expertise of the people using it. Are they coming from a biomedical model? The issues are across the bio-psycho-social area. We are not doing enough to support people with a dual diagnosis."

As that story says, Davina came from a household where there was domestic abuse and sexual abuse and no one was minding her as a child. More investment in youth services is needed."

                "The story was covered in \"The Two Norries Podcast\". Her partner, James Leonard, was also in prison and in addiction. Ms Butler's story is probably one of the most powerful stories I have heard because I come from the same area as her. I am the first person from Knocknaheeny to be elected to the Dáil. However, my experience growing up was completely different from Ms. Butlers because of my mother, God rest her soul, and my father. I had a strong family unit, but we lived yards from where she came from. The difference between her life and my life was because I had a stable family unit, I was involved in St. Vincent's GAA and I had friends around me. I was not very good at school. I was a bit of a messer but I had those supports to keep me. When I look at Davina's story and Ms Butler's story, I think what if there had been early intervention?",
                "I will turn to the point Dr. Cullen made about GPs. I had a nephew who died at 21 after taking his first dose of methadone. He was prescribed a minimal amount. His name was Eric Gould, a beautiful young man. He had got on to drugs through prescription medication, including sleeping tablets and painkillers. He had never taken a drug until he was 18 and he was dead at 21. If his GP had been asked a simple question, whether Eric was suitable for methadone, the answer would have been, \"No\", because he had a history of a heart issue. People should not take methadone if they have a heart problem. It goes back to the points made earlier, including by Dr. Healy, about stigma. If people are in addiction, they are considered to be scumbags or not to have families. Eric had been with the same doctors who had a full medical history. All that was needed was for someone to link in with his GP. Will Dr. Cullen and Dr. Healy comment on the importance of treating people in addiction like human beings with lives and families? Some people might not have anyone, but many people have people who support them."

Family is definitely a huge factor, among others. We do a lot of research into drug problems, but we do not do enough into protection and preventative factors. We need to take a long-term perspective and ask what we need to know about what protects young people from risk in their communities. What do we need to do in the long term to turn it around for others? I recall working in the Ana Liffey Project many years ago. Mr. Broderick was there too, but long before that. We used to have the view that we perhaps needed to look at changing the children of the children who were coming in with their parents, because a long-term perspective was needed. We are constantly looking for immediate solutions to problems.",
                "We are never going to get them, but we take a long-term perspective, like the investment that was done in community facilities and services that suddenly stopped when the recession came and was never reinstated. The health budget, for example, has escalated since the recession ended, but the budget for drug services and community and youth services stayed at the same amounts they were at in 2009. That was a reflection of policy decisions. Dr. Lambert mentioned something like €4 million being allocated for this year. The accumulated deficit in some of those services is huge. If we want to rectify the situation with regard to the withdrawal of money from front-line services in 2008 and 2009, we are talking about a huge amount of money before we talk about an increase of €4 million and so on. It is about priorities at the end of the day."

In other countries, they are open 18 hours per day and people can collect their methadone at 6 o'clock in the morning and go to work.

What I have heard has been hugely interesting, especially the points that were made about menopause, which is something I had not factored in or come across. That is mind-blowing. The statistics Dr. Healy provided show that 80% to 90% of participants may have come from trauma. I thought the figure would be much higher than that. I wonder about generational trauma and the impact that is having, which Dr. Healy alluded to already. The children of those parents are obviously being impacted and experiencing some level of trauma from growing up in that kind of environment. Do we have any statistics relating to generational trauma and the impact that is having? Is that included in the trauma statistics or is there a gap there?"

                "Okay, I figured as much. Dr. Healy talked about reducing stigma. That is hugely important in west Clare. I represent County Clare. In west Clare in particular, however, there is a huge issue around drug use but also societal isolation and not being able to get support when it comes to housing. This is a big issue for me with a few lads who are in west Clare. They actually have the mentality that they do not deserve a house. That is what they tell me. That struck a chord with me because having shelter is a basic human right, in my view. Everyone should have it regardless, so it is sad to hear that they have basically lost the fight to even want to have shelter. Their health is deteriorating. Their mental health is deteriorating even more. I cannot see how it is going to improve for those individuals, especially if they are not going to get access to shelter. This is a major obstacle in County Clare. I believe it has an awful lot to do with the stigma, which is probably to do with those working in public office, for example. Do the witnesses have any thoughts in respect of how I can tackle that? Is decriminalisation the only way forward in terms of having a serious impact on reducing stigma? I ask that question because my thought process is that this is the only way we are going to make headway.",
                "The other issue is centralised care. What I am getting from Dr. Healy is that we need to move away from that. It needs to be individualised care. We have an issue with a lack of GPs in County Clare, however. West Clare is so far removed even from Ennis, the main town in County Clare. I know individuals who have never left Kilrush, which sounds crazy but that is the reality for them. They are 45 minutes away from Ennis. The best way to put it is that it feels like being in a whole different country. When you go to west Clare, it just feels so detached from everywhere else. There are people who do not leave that locality, so accessing treatment and services when it is 45 minutes to Ennis and further again to Limerick is too big of a task for them. We also have issues relating to transportation and the cost. That is another issue people have reported to me. They really want to get help but it is just too difficult and they cannot afford to go. They may also have issues with the pass. They may have been in prison and may lose their disability allowance and their pass. It is a whole obstacle to try to get all that back into play. I agree with Dr. Healy in that regard. There are too many obstacles for them. I was hoping there might be an opportunity for the Government to put in place a Leap card or something else to facilitate that, or even a shuttle bus.",

This is a woman with four children, three of whom are on the spectrum, and she was taken off the list for a year. Thankfully, she was housed recently, after a year or maybe a year-and-a-half's battle. She had been a victim of domestic abuse and what she had gone through only all came out afterwards in court. When we are looking at decriminalisation, it would probably have made a huge difference for this woman. She was blocked from getting a house for at least a year and a half just for having cannabis, and it turned out she had been forced to hold it for her ex-partner, her abuser.",

We talk about stigma. When people are stigmatised to that extent, it has an enormous impact on their mental health, how they feel, their self-confidence and their connection to society.

                "I agree with Mr. Mullins about the importance of having stability. For example, in the job I was working in before I came back to Saol, a woman came in to me for support around applying for housing. She had been going through issues with addiction, etc., and had given her children up for voluntary care. At the time, she was in a two-bedroom apartment. With the trauma of her children being taken into care, etc., she ended up slipping back into addiction. There was a raid on her home. She lost her home and she ended up in homeless accommodation. I refer to the criteria for her to even get her children back, even though she was doing well in her recovery. I will state I do not look at recovery as someone going through detox. Recovery is people making a change, making positive changes in their lives, whether they are on methadone for the rest of their lives or on Buvidal, Suboxone or any of the other treatments there are now. Recovery is making those positive changes. This woman was doing all that. She was still on treatment but that was her recovery. She was attending services and doing everything she could but what was stopping her from getting her children back was the fact that, because she was in a hostel, she no longer fitted the criteria for the three-bedroom house she needed to get her children back. That stable accommodation piece is really important. When we look at expecting people to jump through hoops, we need to start looking at the barriers the State is putting there through its policies."

Ms Anna Quigley, who was here last week, said that, in the past, there was a much better integrated co-operative system between the HSE, the different Departments, the different community groups and service providers. Do we need to get back to that kind of system, getting everyone around the table to develop policy and deliver what needs to happen?

It is things such as housing and mental health. Deputy Wynne talked about how we define trauma. One of the issues is that poverty is a trauma. Homelessness is a trauma. We have not spoken here today about the impact of discrimination on the Traveller community. All of those things are traumas but we do not necessarily think of them like that when we are talking about it. There is a problem with how we define trauma. If somebody comes in to you and they are experiencing challenges and difficulties as a result of their addiction, you cannot just look at that. You have to look at their access to mental health, housing, education and employment. I will go back to the fundamental point about structural inequality, however. I would much prefer that we tackle structural inequality so that we are not sitting around having inter-agency case management meetings. A lot of what we are talking about is a response to a chronic problem but if we did not have people in poverty or locked out of education, employment and housing, we would not need to address all of those problems and we would save a whole lot of money."

If 70% of people in prison have addiction, we know people will come out and need these supports in communities and that communities will need support. There is plenty that can be done and planned. Statistics from a county in the midlands show it built four units last year. Apparently it overshot its social housing targets by approximately 100% but, of that, there were four single units built.

Only people working in the sector were passionate about it but we are now having a great conversation about it. That in itself is progress. There are pros and cons to every aspect of the decriminalisation argument. Codeine was mentioned and I recall not that long ago when Solpadeine was endemic across the State and it was primarily used by women. There was a major issue around Solpadeine. It was over the counter and legally readily available, yet there was still a problem, so legalisation will not necessarily address the issues we are confronted with daily. One of the recommendations was for greater investment, and that would have to be on a proportion we are nowhere near. We need significantly increased investment in supports for people and it has to be more targeted that it is. We spoke about how people who do not need universal payments are getting them. One citizens' assembly recommendation was about targeting supports at the areas of greatest need.",

It will have a negative impact on that if it results in a resource investment that continues to extend and exacerbate some of the bad practices that are there already. That is a really possible outcome. There are some very good practices but there are some very poor practices.",
                "There is a bigger picture here and it behoves parliamentarians to consider that bigger picture. That picture has to be about trying to change that narrative and trying to envisage turning this around by looking at a different model that involves a form of legalisation to start with, and then see how that works out. Give it time, look to other models and see what they are doing. I also advise that, in the long term, some of these models, particularly in Europe, will come knocking on the door in due course and saying, from a commercial point of view, that they have a right to provide cannabis products in Ireland, that we are blocking that through our laws, and that they will take Ireland to the competition court. They will probably do that. If we get to that point, we will be leaving it to the private market to determine the type of system.

                "One thing that is really important when we talk about drug use is that we often find it difficult not to think about our own personal opinions or views. The most important thing is that going back, we have a huge amount of information from our own jurisdiction and other jurisdictions. The big question for the State is why we have so much information and so little implementation. If we take cannabis as an example and look at it in respect of risk of harm to oneself and others, it is one of the least harmful substances. Codeine is more dangerous than ecstasy. The problem is that we have these moral judgments. There are things I feel uncomfortable with but that is irrelevant. When I feel uncomfortable that is based on my value system and how society has structured our views and opinions. It is actually very easy to do the right thing by just looking at what exists. We know that the criminalisation of people who use drugs has caused horrendous harm. It has not reduced the number of people who are using drugs. It has not reduced the amount of drugs that are coming into the country. In fact, it has made things much more dangerous. That is what the evidence shows.",
                "Decriminalisation will be useful in some ways, and I want to say that those middle-class young people who get caught also deserve to not experience harm. With regard to people who want to use cannabis, that is a rights issue. What we need to do is look at the existing evidence, and the existing evidence is that criminalisation does not work. Decriminalisation reduces some of the harm but it will not go far enough. We probably need to look at the states that have introduced legalisation and where they have made mistakes. America is a very good example. It allowed the private market to control cannabis. That meant that people who live in communities where there is very little money cannot go into one of these places and buy cannabis that costs a lot of money. That left a black market. Sometimes the people who argue against these things will say we should look at America where legalisation made no difference to that illegal market. That is because we introduced a middle-class cause and took a middle-class approach to how we have designed our society without thinking about everybody who should be sitting around the table."

If you really look at the statistics, it did not have any impact on the number of people using drugs but it had a huge impact on the harms of drugs, in that rates of hepatitis C, HIV and so on dropped. We also need to think about the fact that current drug policy has caused more harms than the actual substances themselves, in my opinion. I will say that again. Drug policy has caused more harms than drugs themselves. It is urgent we change this straight away. As Dr. Cullen and everybody else have said, there are a number of models around the world that we can learn from, not replicate but learn from and cherry-pick and come up with something that works for this country and makes things better for everybody."

This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting. However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that it is not abused. Therefore, if statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative they comply with such directions.",

Members are reminded of the provision of Standing Order 218, that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits or the objectives of such policies.

I completed my review of the audit work around mid-June, and cleared the accounts for signing, subject to a number of issues, including two proposed impairments, being finalised. I am waiting for the university to present final accounts approved by the governing authority, so that I can present my report on the 2022-2023 year of account.",
                "Members will recall there have been a number of well-publicised control and governance issues in the University of Limerick in recent years. This and the previous committee inquired repeatedly about issues raised by whistleblowers and about the way concerns raised had been dealt with. In 2018, I presented a special report on the way the university had handled aspects of remuneration of certain senior staff members. Issues reported included higher-than-normal awards of professional added years for pension purposes; the admission of staff of a subsidiary company to the University of Limerick’s pension scheme; and the circumstances of the award of severance terms to two former staff members. In the latter case, we found that the university had previously misrepresented the terms of the severance deals to my office, to the committee and to the Department of further and higher education. In audit certificates in recent years, I have also drawn attention to issues such as non–compliant procurement; senior management overriding of controls; and a severance arrangement with a former president, which the university argued was not a severance. Some of the issues referenced triggered inquiries and reports commissioned by the university into its governance and controls. All of this provides a relevant context for consideration of the special report on the university’s acquisitions of property in Limerick city.",
                "I commenced the special report being considered by the committee today because of the constraints around publication of the KPMG report commissioned by the university into the 2019 acquisition at Honan’s Quay. As part of that, we reviewed the 2022-2023 Rhebogue acquisition to establish whether better processes had been implemented. In April 2019, the university applied to the Higher Education Authority for capital funding towards the development of a premises in the centre of Limerick city. This included a proposal to purchase a site for the development in the city’s opera quarter at an estimated cost of €3 million. However, the university instead approved the purchase of a property at the nearby Honan’s Quay for over €8 million. As we found no evidence of any additional benefits to be gained by the purchase of the Honan’s Quay property compared to that at the opera quarter that would warrant the increased purchase cost, it is difficult to see how that purchase represented value for money.",
                "The university did not obtain a formal valuation report on the property prior to purchase. This was contrary to provisions of the public spending code. Nevertheless, it was represented to the university’s governing authority that a valuation report had been obtained and the governing authority did not request the valuation report.",
                "An independent valuation of the Honan’s Quay property in 2023 concluded the university had paid around one third more than the market value in 2019, even allowing for any special interest it might have in the property.",
                "The university has proposed that a €3 million impairment charge, or write-down loss, be recognised in its 2022-2023 annual financial statements. A key concern is that, more than five years on, the university remains without a clear development and funding plan for the Honan’s Quay property.",
                "The university was approached by a developer in late 2021 regarding a proposal for the construction of houses on a site in Rhebogue which would be either leased or sold to the University for use as student accommodation. Despite the adoption of new property acquisition procedures by the university following the Honan’s Quay acquisition, there were significant failures in the due diligence associated with the Rhebogue development. Prior to the purchase, planning advice from relevant professionals was not conclusive, but the university did not seek clarification from the local authority. In December 2023, the university received a warning letter from Limerick City and County Council stating that the change of use to student accommodation without planning permission may represent an unauthorised development. At the time I was signing the report, this matter had not been resolved.",
                "In March 2022, the university commissioned formal valuation reports to provide the open market value of the Rhebogue properties. In August 2022, the purchase price proposed to the governing authority was based on the net rental yield method for valuing property. Even though the accommodation was generally configured as a standard housing development, information on the sales price comparison method for valuing property was not provided to the governing authority, and this would have yielded a much lower valuation.",
                "The university signed a contract to purchase the houses in August 2022 that required only a peppercorn deposit. It concluded the purchase on 10 October 2023, at a cost of €11.4 million, representing an average purchase price of almost €572,000 per house. The university failed to identify that the purchase was also liable to stamp duty, resulting in an additional cost of over €1 million. A March 2024 independent valuation of the Rhebogue property indicates that the university probably paid significantly more than it should have. The university has proposed to recognise an asset impairment charge of €5.2 million in its 2022-23 annual financial statements.",
                "The report makes recommendations for improvements in the university’s property acquisition policies, procedures and controls. These have been accepted by the university and now need to be properly and effectively implemented."

We have worked closely with that authority to provide the team with all the assistance possible. The scope and the scale of these reviews has been both broad and deep, and they have understandably gone far beyond what happened at Rhebogue. We facilitated these reviews while also ensuring that our commitment to our core mission of academic excellence did not falter.

First, the university significantly overpaid for both assets, and this has resulted in two separate financial impairments in its financial statements for the year 2022-2023. In the case of Honan’s Quay, the amount of the impairment was €3.044 million and, in the case of Rhebogue, the amount is higher at €5.225 million. This represents a cumulative loss of €8.269 million.",
                "Second, the approach to planning was deficient in both cases. Prior to the purchase of the former Dunnes Stores site, no planning advice was taken regarding the change of use. In the case of Rhebogue, professional advice was taken, which suggested that existing planning, which was for residential dwelling houses, was not sufficient. This did not accord with the developer’s advice, and so the situation was uncertain. In both transactions, the extent of the planning risks were not highlighted to the key decision-making committees of the university.",
                "Third, purchase price is a critical issue in any acquisition by a public body and it must be informed by a negotiating strategy. In the case of Honan’s Quay, the university had no written valuation. In the case of Rhebogue, the financial analysis presented to the governing authority represented a justification of the maximum price that the university could reasonably pay for the assets as student accommodation. As pointed out by the C and AG, as a negotiating stance, this was detrimental to the university’s and taxpayers' interests.",
                "The final point I wish to highlight is that concerns were raised in the form of protected disclosures in respect of both transactions. In the case of Honan’s Quay, the decision to purchase was made with undue haste and with limited opportunity for the involvement of the buildings and estates division. That division should have led the acquisition. In the case of Rhebogue, again buildings and estates had limited involvement, and the serious concerns it raised in respect of the transaction were not represented to the governing authority.",
                "As highlighted by the C and AG, in both cases the protected disclosures were managed in a tightly legal-focused way, which did not take account of the more general implications of the disclosures for the university’s system of control and decision-making. This is a key reflection point for the university, and our future approach to such matters will be completely different.",
                "It is noteworthy that, in the aftermath of the Honan’s Quay transaction, the university gave assurance to various stakeholders, including the HEA, the Department of higher education, and this committee that this would not happen again. UL informed the public accounts committee on 18 May 2023 that it was a much-changed institution, yet at the same time, the Rhebogue acquisition had already progressed in a way that did not accord with its new policy on the acquisition of property. As acting Accounting Officer, I am acutely aware we owe the bodies to which we are accountable a legal as well as moral duty of candour.",
                "It is in everyone’s interest that UL is properly run. I assure the committee and the university community that, while we are only at the beginning, there are encouraging signs to that effect. Since our last appearance before the public accounts committee five months ago, the university has taken a number of proactive measures to start this transformation process, including a reset of the executive committee, improved transparency within our community and with stakeholders, enhanced governance, open communications and the adherence to due process. We have fully accepted the recommendations of the C and AG report and are committed to implementing these findings as we drive this process forward.",
                "As acting president, I am confident that both the executive committee and the governing authority are committed to working together in partnership with the HEA. We will take all appropriate steps to achieve transformation and cultural reform in order that UL develops a strong system of governance, high performance and accountability."

I was one of the first students of NIHE, and UL matters a great deal to me. During my time as an undergraduate, I grew up there and UL quite literally grew up around me. I accepted the invitation to become chancellor because of the opportunities, academic career and life experience UL gave me. It was transformative in my life and I wanted to give something back. The chancellor’s role has been nothing like I expected it to be. At just my second meeting as chair, Rhebogue was placed on our meeting agenda and it has not left the agenda since, nor, I have accepted, is it unlikely to for the foreseeable future.",
                "Since we last appeared before the committee, the president has resigned, providing stability and certainty to the university and allowing us an opportunity to commence the process of resetting the executive committee. We have also greatly strengthened, with external expertise, the committees that support the governing authority, in particular audit and risk, finance, people and culture. As the committee knows, we are now subject to a section 64 review.",
                "When I last addressed the university community in March, I said the institution would be subject to extreme oversight. Although that description was perhaps a little too strong, it is clear that the HEA will have direct involvement in UL’s institutional governance for at least the next few years. Although I am a strong advocate of independence and university autonomy, UL could not have expected any other outcome given the governance failures, one after another, which characterised the Honan’s Quay and Rhebogue purchases.",
                "Where are we at? The governing authority has submitted the section 64 review to the HEA. The review was conducted by Deloitte at arm’s length from both the executive committee and the governing authority. The obligation to report to the HEA under section 64, however, rests with the authority. In the feedback provided to us, the HEA challenged us to think critically about the findings and recommendations and what they would mean for UL. We were also asked to consider and prioritise the changes that would be most impactful. The governing authority has done what the HEA has asked, outlining what we think these impactful changes might be. It is now a matter for the HEA to consider the next steps and to chart a way forward in partnership with us and in accordance with its statutory oversight powers.",
                "Let me give the authority’s views. I am conscious the HEA is currently deliberating on an appropriate course of action for the next phase, but I want to give the committee a brief outline of the authority’s reflections. Honan’s Quay and Rhebogue did not occur in a vacuum. Throughout this process we have been asking ourselves how it could be that, despite the change in leadership, so many of the shortcomings were repeated. This is not an easy question but the reports conducted provide us with insight. Certainly, there are structural deficiencies in our systems of governance but culture also played an important part. The governing authority is of the view that approaching reform solely through addressing findings and recommendations, which we will do, will not of itself bring about the change of the scale required. There is a need for deep-rooted cultural change, starting at the top. We are addressing this so that poor governance, similar to Honan’s Quay and Rhebogue, will not arise in the future. Any further lapses in governance would be utterly disastrous for UL’s recovery, and on my watch it will not happen.",
                "Turning to the future, we have four key recommendations. First, we need to establish a transformation programme with a dedicated change management support. There is a large body of recommendations that needs to be worked through diligently and systematically while also thinking about the bigger picture. Given the scale, UL will need to create a dedicated change programme. This will ensure the affairs of the university on a day-to-day basis will also continue. The governing authority will maintain direct oversight of its progress, supported by the audit and risk committee.",
                "Second, the governing authority must model the behaviours that it wishes others to follow. It must be an exemplar of good governance and accountability and must set what I call “tone from the top”. The executive committee is also crucially important here. It will need to lead the cultural change programme on a day-to-day basis, and its members must be instigators, agents, and champions of institutional transformation.",
                "Third is structures, processes and policies of governance. Working closely in partnership with the HEA, the governing authority will lead in the development of the implementation plan, addressing structures, processes and policies of governance with clear action owners, timelines and independent evaluation of progress. Fourth is the prioritisation of internal control, risk management and accountability.",
                "Based on discussions with the newly reconstituted audit and risk committee, I am aware there is a need to greatly strengthen the university’s second and third lines of defence. Risk and compliance require particular attention, and although much has already been done in respect of the former, the latter needs more time and investment. We now have a strong audit and risk committee, but internal audit will need to be significantly strengthened relative to the size and budget of the university.",
                "The governing authority will drive a strong approach to accountability, both individual and collective. There will be zero tolerance for policy deviation and actions that cause the university reputational damage.",
                "This concludes my opening statement. I am happy to assist the members and to address their questions."

There has been a fundamental risk register in the university, as is required, for many years. It contained a large number of risks but, in our view, and having reflected on Rhebogue, it did not reflect the most significant and important risk to a university, which is its reputation as a credential institution. Our fundamental risk register now, therefore, looks at these matters very carefully.",
                "In the case of Rhebogue, it is all very well to have a fundamental risk register, but when somebody is progressing a transaction and taking it through, that person must have at the forefront of their mind what are the risks in relation to the transaction for the university, bearing in mind the risks on the fundamental risk register. I think people do not sometimes make the connections between the actions they are taking at a point in time and what the fundamental risks are and this was possibly a factor in the Rhebogue situation.",
                "In that situation, my recollection is that the risks were in relation to cohesion in the community where the Rhebogue development was located and how the people there would react to having students in a close-knit community. Of course, that was a risk, but there were other risks pertinent to that transaction, including, for example, risks in relation to planning. As the Deputy will know, the situation with the planning is before An Bord Pleanála. It is uncertain how that will go. It may be a case where the planning application may be approved but it may not, and that would leave the university in a difficult situation.",

A judgment call was made in relation to those risks and it was represented that, essentially, the planning was in order. There were other issues as well, as the Deputy will know, in relation to the valuation methodologies and they formed part of the risk framework in this transaction. Again, the governing authority did not have that information available to it at the point at which it made a decision."

These are around additional controls and include the two recommendations made by the Comptroller and Auditor General. A series of other recommendations are being made by Mazars in terms of culture. Additionally, what is going to be really important is that it will not be appropriate for the university to offer assurances in future. There will be a need for independent verification. This is one of the things we have been working closely with the HEA on. It is about mapping those through. This is the beginning point in terms of those recommendations being an anchor point from which we can reset the university to ensure there is a much better standard of governance and management.",
                "To reassure the Deputy as well, to some extent that process has already commenced and it has commenced through a reset of the executive. Some of the people, and the Chair and some of the other members will be aware of this point, who were raising concerns from the outset are now part of the executive team and are contributing in this context. The university itself, through the strategic governance committee, has been bringing issues to light and bringing forward its own recommendations. This includes, and this was an issue raised in this committee previously, the lack of a valuation. It was the strategic governance committee of the university that brought that in and is providing an evidence-based way in which we can go forward. We have a valuation and a whole series of recommendations from that committee too. The committee is composed of a group of colleagues, including from the professoriate in the college and people from across a variety of different units, such as quality, buildings and estates and finance, working together to try to put recommendations in place that will move us in the direction of good governance."

There would be a major level of enthusiasm surrounding any new capital project. I asked if that enthusiasm clouded the judgment of the authority. At the time I was told that was not the case. The major disappointment is that neither inner-city site ultimately became available or was progressed. There is now an unfunded proposal sitting there.

In the other two, there is an accounting issue and an information issue inside the university. The UL case has longer legs. As we are going, we are developing the protocols for doing this work. In this case, we kicked off the section 64 review in March. We went down to the university to conduct interviews right across the university. We spoke at length to staff, students, administrators, academics and the governing authority. On the basis of that, we redrafted our terms of reference to include matters like a review of the advices that were given, a deep dive into the culture of the university as part of the section 64 review, and an examination of subsidiaries. That extended beyond Rhebogue and Dunnes Stores. In parallel with that, we commissioned other reports on the protected disclosures. The barrister will report to us in the next couple of weeks on how UL handled the protected disclosures. There is also a major deep dive by Mazars into the culture of the university. The HEA tried to do this in 2016 but did not get a chance to complete it. That report will come to us as well. We are looking back over 15 years of capital expenditure. We are fully using our powers to get as big a picture as we can."

I am concerned because I am getting reports that the university has upwards of 18,000 students, and clearly many of them know who is on the public accounts committee, and the information I have is that good money is being thrown after bad. Having spent €10 million, UL may well end up having to spend €20 million or €30 million to redo the whole portal. I am asking a very straight question. Does the university know if it has had value for money and that the portal is where it wants it to be? I understand it is a very important part of the university's operational infrastructure but was it clear from the outset that it could not be fixed and it needed to be completely overhauled at the cost of €30 million? Is the university going to spend €30 million now having already spent €10 million? Professor Kilcommins should bear in mind that he will be here again at this time next year, and maybe before then."

A huge amount of back room work goes into that by the secretariat of the committee as well all the work we did not get to because we were dealing with this. Then, when we look at section 64, Dr. Wall is telling us about the considerable resource the Higher Education Authority, HEA, is putting into it. The actual amount of money the taxpayer is putting into this issue and the lack of governance at University of Limerick, UL, is astonishing. We are not going to get to the bottom of that. We will not get a full figure for that, but I want to outline that before I began the questioning.",

There was a quickness on the part of UL and other institutions to point out the legal deficits of any kind of approach the university was subject to. This has not been our experience.

I find it hard to get my head around the fact that this happened after all of the problems with curtains, sheets and crazy ideas about buying a house here in Dublin, and after we went through everything with the Dunnes Stores transaction. You would say to yourself that procedures must now be put in place and people have to get their act together.",

Of course, these reports had to be done but, as a layperson, I know that you check the stamp duty and the planning permission when buying or selling property. It is very basic. Any Joe or Mary Soap would know that, as would their solicitor. There is mention of deficient record-keeping, tax implications and the absence of a valuation. As I said the last day UL was in here, there is something I cannot get my head around as regards Rhebogue. If I was going to buy a house somewhere, I would go on Daft.ie or some other website or I would look in the windows of local auctioneers to see what houses were making in that area. We are buried in reports here. We accept that they were necessary but they work out as being expensive. These reports seek to find out why these basics were not adhered to.

I think it should consider that this is something it never intended to buy, certainly not for the money that it cost. It would be much better to off-load it to someone who can take responsibility and then lease it back - let it be Limerick City and County Council off its own bat. However, it should get rid of it because it is already doing the university huge damage, no more than with Rhebogue. If the university is not going to get planning permission, it should sell off those houses, give them to the people who require them and get into an estate where it can build student accommodation under the planning, which it should do. I hope it is looking at sites so that may be the case. Is any site proposed in case the university does not get planning for Rhebogue? Is anybody looking at that?",

It is correspondence to the committee providing a response to information we requested at the meeting on 11 July. It is proposed to note and publish that. Is that agreed? Agreed. I have flagged this, as did Deputy Murphy. I raised this issue with Mr. Sheahan, the deputy chief veterinary officer at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine at the meeting. He said, \"If you were to ask me even three weeks ago what were standards like within the slaughter plant in Straffan I would say that standards were very good within this slaughter plant\". Now the Department is saying, in point No. 1 of this correspondence, that investigations go as far back as 2021 and 2022. It repeats it on page 4. It says there was no cause for concern, even though there were ongoing investigations. A good few of us, including Deputy Murphy, raised the matter of the 20,000 horses that have gone missing with no trace. The Department says that unfortunately there is no data source against which this proposition can be checked, verified or validated. The whole thing seems to be wide open, for want of a better word. Deputy Murphy indicated that she wanted to say something on this too."

It goes on to say that the Department issued a food fraud notification on 20 June through the EU rapid alert system for food and feed, RASFF, to the French authorities to advise of its suspicion of fraud associated with the plant, which had supplied products to a location in France, to enable French authorities to assess what action might be necessary or appropriate in France.

I am surprised there were only five, because I have had people tell me that they complained on multiple occasions. When I asked the Department about it when officials were before the committee, they said there were five individual complaints. I know that one person complained multiple times. It does not seem to have been captured. The plant itself appears to have been the focus, although some of the stuff on the television programme would have given major cause for concern about the behaviour of individuals within that plant.

Tá sé ríthábhachtach freisin go bhfuil muinín ag pobal na Gaeilge sna seirbhísí poiblí a chuireann an Stát ar fáil trí Ghaeilge. Cothaítear muinín i seirbhísí poiblí nuair a fheiceann an pobal go bhfuil cothrom na Féinne a fháil aige i ndáil le seirbhísí poiblí ar ardchaighdeán a chur ar fáil ina rogha teanga gan bhac, gan stró.",

I gcaitheamh 2023, ba le gealltanais scéimeanna teanga nach raibh á gcur i bhfeidhm mar ba chóir a bhain 39% de líon iomlán na ngearáin a fuair m’oifig . Léiríonn an staid seo an géarghá atá le córas na gcaighdeán teanga a thabhairt i bhfeidhm. I measc na laigí ba shuntasaí a bhain le córas na scéimeanna teanga, bhí cúlú ar ghealltanais ó scéim go scéim, doiléireacht maidir le sonraíocht na seirbhíse a bhí le soláthar agus easpa soiléireacht maidir leis na hacmhainní foirne a bhí sé de dhualgas ar chomhlacht poiblí a chur ar fáil ina leith.

Go dtí seo in 2024 líonadh dhá phost, post nua amháin ar leibhéal ardoifigigh feidhmiúcháin agus aislíonadh poist ag leibhéal oifigigh feidhmiúcháin de thoradh ball foirne a chuaigh ar scor i mí na Samhna 2023. Tá ceithre fholúntas ag an oifig faoi láthair agus tá dúshlán áirithe ag eascairt ón achar ama a thógann sé poist áirithe a líonadh, go háirithe i bhfianaise an ualaigh oibre mhéadaithe ar fhoireann na hoifige de bharr theacht i bhfeidhm Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla (Leasú), 2021. Tá obair ollmhór á déanamh ag foireann reatha na hoifige le déileáil leis an gclár oibre trom agus dúshlánach atá ar lámh. Is státseirbhísigh ar iasacht ó Roinn na Gaeltachta iad foireann uile na hoifige, cé is moite den Choimisinéir Teanga, a cheapann Uachtarán na hÉireann, le tacaíocht Thithe an Oireachtais ar mholadh an Rialtais. Bíonn an oifig ag brath ar chomórtais phainéil a reáchtálann an Roinn i gcomhar leis an tSeirbhís um Cheapacháin Phoiblí agus d’fhéadfadh tréimhse bliana nó níos faide a bheith i gceist le poist ar leith a líonadh.",
                "Ábhar suntais go bhfuil cead earcaíochta dá gcuid féin ag oifigí Ombudsman eile in Éirinn a thugann an tsaoirse dóibh a gcuid comórtas earcaíochta féin a reáchtáil. Tá buntáistí ar leith ag baint le socruithe den tsóirt seo lena n-áirítear a bheith in ann sainchritéir a bhaineann le róil ar leith a shonrú sna fógraí d’fholúntais maidir leis na róil seo. Ba chóir breathnú ar shocrú den chineál seo sa chás go bhfuil tréimhsí fada i gceist le folúntais áirithe a líonadh san oifig ar bhonn leanúnach.",
                "Beidh plean forbartha eagraíochtúil á fhoilsiú againn don oifig an bhliain seo chugainn a chuimseoidh riachtanais fhoirne agus oibríochta meántéarmacha na hoifige don tréimhse 2025 go 2028. Tréimhse fhíorthábhachtach a bheidh sna trí bliana ó 2025 go 2028 mar go mbeidh an oifig ag tabhairt aghaidh ar an ualach oibre a eascróidh ó na forálacha reachtúla nua atá le teacht i bhfeidhm go fóill, agus ó thaobh monatóireachta a dhéanamh ar fheidhmiú na forála 20% d’earcaithe le Gaeilge, ar na caighdeáin teanga nua agus ar an bplean náisiúnta trí chéile.",
                "Is tréimhse chinniúnach a bheidh sna blianta beaga seo romhainn ar mhaithe le cearta teanga phobal na Gaeilge a threisiú ach feabhas as cuimse a theacht ar chaighdeán na seirbhísí poiblí atá ar fáil don phobal trí Ghaeilge. Mar Choimisinéir Teanga, feicim deiseanna nach bhfacthas a leithéid cheana chun sineirgíocht a chothú idir bearta suntasacha de shraith straitéisí an Stáit i dtaca leis an nGaeilge a chur chun cinn go náisiúnta. Is bearta suntasacha de shraith straitéisí an Stáit iad Acht na Gaeltachta, 2012, a chuir an próiseas pleanála teanga ar bhonn reachtúil ar mhaithe le buanú na Gaeilge mar phríomhtheanga phobail sa Ghaeltacht, agus Achtanna 2003 agus 2021, a láidríonn cearta teanga an phobail. Ní mór athshamhlú agus athchumrú a dhéanamh ar sheachadadh seirbhísí poiblí an Stáit trí Ghaeilge. Is den bhunriachtanas é go mbeadh éascaíocht agus mealltacht ag baint le rochtain ar sheirbhísí poiblí do phobal labhartha na Gaeilge. Mar aon le dlús criticiúil foirne le Gaeilge i gcomhlachtaí poiblí ionas go gcuirfidh an pobal teanga muinín i seachadadh seirbhísí poiblí, tá rochtain ar na seirbhísí chomh tábhachtach céanna.",
                "Tá deiseanna ar leith trína bhféadfadh an próiseas pleanála teanga agus an reachtaíocht teanga teacht aníos le réitigh shamhlaíocha trína mbeidh freastal i bhfad níos fearr á dhéanamh ag an Stát ar phobal na Gaeilge. Tá bonneagar náisiúnta pleanála teanga á fhorbairt trí na limistéir phleanála teanga, líonraí agus bailte seirbhíse Gaeltachta a mba chóir a úsáid le rochtain i bhfad níos fearr a éascú don phobal teanga ar sheirbhísí poiblí i nGaeilge. Má shamhlaítear moil nó campais ilfhreastail a mbeadh lonnaíocht láidir iontu ó thaobh foirne na gcomhlachtaí poiblí a bheadh ag seachadadh seirbhísí poiblí trí Ghaeilge, tógfadh a leithéid de champais ar an mbonneagar oideachais, teicneolaíochta, sealbhaithe agus buanaithe teanga atá sa nGaeltacht cheana. Chothófaí dlús sa raon seirbhísí poiblí, dlús sa bpobal foirne a bheadh ag seachadadh na seirbhísí agus dlús san éileamh ón bpobal teanga lena leithéid de shamhail seachadta seirbhísí poiblí. Luíodh an forás seo isteach go huile agus go hiomlán leis na forálacha nua atá san Acht leasaithe freisin go mbeidh an Ghaeilge ina teanga oibre in oifigí na gcomhlachtaí poiblí sa Ghaeltacht ó dháta a fhorordóidh Aire na Gaeltachta.",
                "Mar fhocal scoir, gabhaim buíochas leis an bpobal agus na comhlachtaí poiblí as a gcomhar agus a gcúirtéis sa déileáil a bhíonn agam féin agus ag foireann na hoifige leo.",

Mar atá luaite agam, tá sárú leanúnach ar na forálacha sin ag tarlú i gcásanna áirithe. Is samplaí maithe de na dúshláin atá romhainn iad an dá chás a luaigh an Seanadóir. Leag mé béim ar an tábhacht a bhaineann le tabhairt i bhfeidhm na bhforálacha uilig atá san Acht teanga nua. Tá cúpla ceist ann. Tá an-béim leagtha agam ar shícé rialachais. Chonaic muid uilig le roinnt blianta an bhéim atá á leagan ar ghéilliúlacht do chosaint sonraí, agus ar sláinte agus sábháilteachta. Tá mise go láidir den tuairim go dteastaíonn athrú meoin sa státchóras agus i gcomhlachtaí poiblí leis na cearta teanga a thabhairt isteach i lár an phróisis pleanála atá ag na comhlachtaí poiblí. Go praiticiúil, má tá scéim comharthaíochta i gceist - nó má tá pleanáil á dhéanamh foireann a earcú a bheidh i mbun cumarsáide leis an bpobal, mar a bhí sa dhá chás seo - caithfear ceist na hinniúlachta teanga a bheith i lár an phróisis pleanála sin. Is é sin an fáth a bhfuil an plean náisiúnta agus na caighdeáin teanga ann. Má bhreathnaímid ar céard atá sna caighdeáin teanga, leagtar amach go soiléir céard iad na seirbhísí, sa bhreis ar na forálacha atá san Acht, a chaitheas an comhlacht poiblí a chur ar fáil. Tá an leibhéal cumas teanga a chaitheas a bheith ag an bhfoireann leis an tseirbhís a chur ar fáil an-tábhachtach. Tá dlúthcheangal ag na riachtanais sin ó thaobh cúrsaí foirne agus cumas teanga le feidhmiú na mbunfhorálacha, mar atá luaite ag an Seanadóir, ó thaobh comharthaíocht de agus ó thaobh cumarsáid de.",
                "An ghné eile atá tábhachtach ná go bhfuil duine ainmnithe anois do bhainistíocht na gcomhlachtaí poiblí. Tá dualgas ar an gcomhlacht poiblí duine a ainmniú le maoirseacht a dhéanamh ar fheidhmiú na bhforálacha atá sa reachtaíocht teanga. Tá an ról sin criticiúil. In imeacht aimsire, ag tarraingt ar fhoráil eile, tá an coiste comhairleach in ann moladh a dhéanamh d'Aire na Gaeltachta maidir le gráid agus líon foirne ar chóir a bheith ag comhlachtaí poiblí le freagairt den chúram. I gcomhthéacs an t-athrú meoin a theastaíonn, caithfidh bainisteoirí sinsearacha a bhfuil dualgais ó thaobh pleanáil rialachais agus cúrsaí corparáideach orthu a bheith i lár na pleanála - i gcás na samplaí atá tugtha ag an Seanadóir, ó thaobh comharthaíocht de agus ó thaobh cumarsáid de. Maidir leis an bpleanáil atá ar siúl nuair a théann ardbhainistíocht na gcomhlachtaí poiblí síos agus plean eagraíochtúil an chomhlachta phoiblí á leagan amach, caithfidh cás na gcearta teanga - na riachtanais teanga - a bheith i lár an phróisis pleanála sin. Tá ról ag an oifig ann freisin dár ndóigh ó thaobh cúrsaí feasachta, ach tá 550 comhlacht poiblí forordaithe faoin Acht agus sa bplean forbartha eagraíochtúil a thagair mé dó. Beidh orainn breathnú go cúramach ar acmhainní na hoifige ar mhaithe le freastal ar an gcúram sin ionas go mbeidh an oifig in ann an fheasacht agus an tuiscint ar an reachtaíocht teanga a chothú. Láidrigh muid é sin go mór san oifig le blianta beaga le cothú post sinsearach bainistíochta, áit a bhfuil Páidí Ó Lionáird ag feidhmiú mar bhainisteoir cumarsáide. Táimid ag dul ina threo sin ach tríd an bplean forbartha eagraíochtúil don oifig féin, beidh céimeanna breise ag teastáil le freastal ar an riachtanas atá ann. Caithfidh na comhlachtaí poiblí feasacht a bheith acu ar an ndualgas, ach níos tábhachtaí fós, caithfidh na cearta teanga a bheith greanta fite fuaite sa bpleanáil eagraíochtúil atá ar siúl acu. Tá an soláthar san Acht nua criticiúil chuige sin. Caithfidh go mbeidh dóthain foirne le Gaeilge agus go mbeidh gráid na bpostanna atá ag plé leis an bpleanáil rialachais stiúrthóirí, rialachais corparáide agus mar sin de airdeallach faoi fheidhmiú na gcearta teanga ag chuile leibhéil san eagraíocht nó sa chomhlacht poiblí."

Mar a luaigh mé san aitheasc, tá dhá ghné gur crainn taca iad den phlean náisiúnta: an 20% d'earcaithe le Gaeilge agus na caighdeáin teanga. Ní féidir liom réamh-bhreithiúnas a thabhairt ar an bplean náisiúnta, ach feicimse céimeanna sonracha. Is gníomh stairiúil atá ansin go mbeidh plean náisiúnta de sheirbhísí poiblí an Stáit trí Ghaeilge don chéad uair ann agus taighde suntasach déanta air. Beidh sé le foilsiú sna seachtainí amach romhainn. Is iad na crainn taca d'fheidhmiú an phlean náisiúnta sin ná cén chaoi a mbeidh dóthain foirne sna húdaráis áitiúla, mar a luaigh an Seanadóir, agus - go háirithe ar dtús - sna comhlachtaí poiblí ós rud é go bhfuil na comhlachtaí sin ag cur ar fáil na croísheirbhísí atá an pobal ag tarraingt orthu chuile lá; agus cén chaoi a mbeidh dóthain cumas teanga - an leibhéal cuí teanga - ag an bhfoireann. Má thugann tú iad sin uilig le chéile, tá tú ag teacht ar an bhfadhb atá ann i láthair na huaire ó threonna éagsúla. Caithfidh an pacáiste comhtháite a bheith ann. Faraor, is í an taithí a bhíonn againn faoi láthair le roinnt mhaith gearán ná nuair a chuireann baill den phobal glaoch leis an tseirbhís trí Ghaeilge a fháil - seirbhísí teileafóin, mar shampla - tá an seirbhís sin thar a bheith tearc mar níl an dualgas leagtha síos in Acht 2003 a leithéid de sheirbhís a chur ar fáil. I roinnt de na scéimeanna teanga, bhí an dualgas sin sonraithe ach is mionlach a bhí sna comhlachtaí poiblí a raibh orthu seirbhís chomh bunúsach le seirbhís teileafóin trí mheán na Gaeilge a chur ar fáil. Cén chaoi gur féidir teanga a chothú mura bhfuil sí á saothrú mar theanga bheo? An dúshlán atá romhainn anois leis an bplean náisiúnta ná go n-aithneofar na croísheirbhísí mar thús, go n-aithneofar cén líon foirne a theastaíonn leis na seirbhísí sin a chur ar fáil sna comhlachtaí poiblí ar leith, go n-aithneofar cén cumas teanga a chaitheas a bheith ag an bhfoireann lena chinntiú go bhfuil cothrom na Féinne á fháil ag pobal na Gaeilge - rud a leag mé béim air i m'aitheasc - agus go mbeidh muinín ag an bpobal sin as na seirbhísí sin.",

Caithfear na bunluachanna a thabhairt isteach i lár an phlean náisiúnta agus seirbhísí nua agus feabhsaithe á bpleanáil trí mheán na Gaeilge. Tá muid ag caint ar athrú meoin atá an-tábhachtach.

Is é an dúshlán soiléir atá romhainn don chaighdeánú teanga ná an easpa leanúnachais sna scéimeanna teanga. Bhí comhlachtaí poiblí in ann cúlú ó ghealltanais a bhí acu ó scéim teanga amháin go dtí scéim teanga eile. Is é seo an córas a bheidh ag imeacht anois. Caithfidh na caighdeáin teanga dul i bhfeidhm leis an doiléireacht agus débhríocht atá ag baint leis na gealltanais. Tá mise go láidir den tuairim, agus thagraigh an Seanadóir Kyne do na húdaráis áitiúla ansin a bhfuil ceantair Ghaeltachta ina gceantair, i gcás comhlachtaí poiblí atá ag freastal ar phobal Gaeltachta agus ar líonraí teanga go náisiúnta, is féidir na róil shinsearacha atá riachtanach a aithint trí phróiseas na gcaighdeán teanga le dul i ngleic leis an mbearna mhór a bhí sna scéimeanna teanga. Is riachtanas teanga éigeantach atá i gceist anseo, is é sin, go mbeidh sé riachtanach seachas roghnach. Is é sin an t-aon bhealach ar féidir dul i ngleic leis an doiléireacht a bhaineann le córas na scéimeanna teanga. Tá sé sin le feiceáil againn i raon leathan na ngéarán a bhaineann le córas na scéimeanna teanga.",

Sa soláthar a bhí sa reachtaíocht ann go dtí seo, áfach, ach an oiread leis an gcás ar luaigh an Seanadóir Kyne ó thaobh cheapadh bhall foirne sinsearaí, ní raibh aon dualgas ann maidir le seirbhísí bunúsacha ar líne, ach amháin i gcásanna inar chuir comhlacht poiblí an dualgas sin isteach sa scéim teanga. Tá muid ag feiceáil bearnaí ollmhóra, fiú leis an ardán a luaigh mé níos luaithe, MyGovID. Cé go bhfuil mórchuspóirí ag an Stát bunsheirbhísí ar nós an ceadúnas tiomána, an pas agus an cárta seirbhíse sóisialta a chur ar fáil ar líne, is iad sin na seirbhísí a dhéanann bainistiú ar an gcaidreamh idir an saoránach agus an Stát chuile lá, mura fuil na seirbhísí sin ar fáil ar ardchaighdeán ar líne agus i gcumarsáid labhartha ar an teileafón leis an tseirbhís a bhaint amach, tá sé an-deacair a shamhlú cén chaoi a dtiocfaidh feabhas as cuimse ar sheirbhísí poiblí trí Ghaeilge, gan trácht ar na cearta teanga earnálacha ar thagraigh mé dóibh ar nós cúrsaí oideachais, cúrsaí pleanála agus cúrsaí craoltóireachta, mar shampla.",

D’fhreastail mé ar Chomhdháil Pleanála Teanga i bPáirc an Chrócaigh inné. Thuig mé ón Roinn go bhfuil sí coinsiasach d'aicme na gcomhlachtaí poiblí atá ag cur croísheirbhísí ar fáil don phobal agus go rachfar i ngleic leis na bearnaí sin sna dréachtchaighdeáin tosaigh. Ní féidir réamhbhreithiúnas a thabhairt air. Is é an ról atá an oifig s'againn ná monatóireacht a dhéanamh ar an dlí teanga nuair atá sé tugtha i bhfeidhm. Caithfidh mé a rá, ón fheasacht atá againn ar na géaráin atá ag teacht aníos go seasta, cuireann muid í sin in iúl don Roinn trí na tuarascálacha bliantúla agus trí chumarsáid a bhíonn againn faoi na dúshláin atá muid ag feiceáil amuigh ansin.",

Má tá róil shinsearacha ag freastal ar an nGaeltacht, is féidir na róil sin a aithint trí phróiseas na gcaighdeán teanga.

Táim ag tagairt don bhéim a leagtar ar chosaint sonraí, sláinte agus sábháilteacht agus a leithéid.

Rinne páirtithe leasmhara, baill an chomhchoiste san áireamh, moladh le cinntiú go raibh an soláthar sin sa reachtaíocht teanga mar, mura mbaineann an teanga leis an saol comhaimseartha, na meáin shóisialta agus mar sin de, tá sé an-deacair í a chothú mar theanga laethúil chomhaimseartha. Beidh an tuarascáil sin á foilsiú againn. Roghnaigh muid Oireachtas na Samhna mar gheall ar an tarraingt go mbeidh pobal na Gaeilge air agus gur osradharc ar na dea-scéalta a bheidh ann.",

Thagair mé ansin do na bearnaí sa soláthar maidir le hardchruinneas teanga agus mé ag caint leis an Seanadóir faoi chúrsaí comharthaíochta agus cumarsáide. Tá dúshláin roimh na comhlachtaí poiblí agus caithfear tacú leo le cinntiú go bhfuil fáil acu ar sheirbhísí comhairleoireachta teanga chomh héasca agus is féidir. Tá ceacht le foghlaim ón soláthar d'aistritheoirí agus de shaineolaithe teanga a rinne an tAontas Eorpach le deich mbliana anuas maidir leis an gcaoi inar féidir tacú leis an earnáil phoiblí na deacrachtaí seo a shárú. Táimid ag plé le míchruinneas ag teacht amach ó sheirbhísí bunúsacha. Tá earnáil na tráchtála agus na saoraistritheoirí ag déanamh obair den scoth. Tá an séala creidiúnaithe atá curtha i dtoll a chéile ag an bhforas le moladh ach teastaíonn uainn breathnú ar na cineálacha seirbhísí atá ar fáil taobh istigh d'achar ama réasúnta atá in ann dul i ngleic leis na dúshláin atá ag an 500 nó níos mó comhlacht poiblí chun nach mbeadh aon cheist ann ach go mbeadh ardchruinneas teanga i gcroílár an phróiseas pleanála nuair atá comharthaí á gcur amach, cumarsáid bhunúsach ar siúl nó fógraí á gcraoladh."

Is é sin an fáth go bhfuil mé ag leagan béime ar uillinneacha an Stáit a bheith ag oibriú go maith as lámha a chéile ó thaobh cur chun cinn na Gaeilge. Tá sampla praiticiúla curtha i láthair againn, mar shampla an mbonneagar náisiúnta pleanála teanga.

Is dóigh liom gur féidir teacht aníos le bealaí ar nós na mol champais nó na hionad ilfhreastal go bhfuil foirne ó na comhlachtaí poiblí lonnaithe iontu agus oifigigh pleanála teanga páirteach in imeachtaí ansin.",

Beidh obair ollmhór - stairiúil, déarfainn - le déanamh anseo le hoiliúint a chur ar dóthain foirne. An rud ná cén chaoi a dtabharfar faoin oiliúint sin, agus cén sórt bonneagar ollscolaíochta sa Ghaeltacht agus go náisiúnta a theastóidh chuige. Tá scéal an-dearfach á thabhairt ag an Roinn. Bhí tráchtaireacht le gairid ar shuirbhé a rinne sé gur léirigh breis agus 30,000 duine atá ag obair sa tseirbhís phoiblí cheana féin spéis cur lena gcumas Gaeilge. Tá sé sin an-dearfach. Táimid ag caint ar scála ollmhór anseo le freastal ar an 20% áfach. Beidh forbairt mhór ag teastáil sna hinstitiúidí léann tríd an bpróiseas pleanála teanga lena chinntiú go bhfuil an soláthar foirne sin ann. Beidh an tús an-tábhachtach don phlean náisiúnta. Tá na seirbhísí atáimid tar éis cur síos a dhéanamh orthu bearnach faoi láthair. Thug mé sampla praiticiúil ansin ó thaobh seirbhísí áirithe ar líne ar ardán ar nós MyGovID ach tá na seirbhísí aghaidh le haghaidh nó ar an teileafón a theastaíonn fós.

Mura bhfuil feiceálacht na seirbhíse ar fáil, tuigeann muid go mbíonn dioscúrsa ar siúl nach bhfuil an t-éileamh ann. Dár ndóigh mura bhfuil muinín agus caighdeán ag baint leis an seirbhís, céard a tharlaíonn? Tarlaíonn creimeadh ar mhuinín agus ar an éileamh ar an tseirbhís.

                "Ceapaim gur ceist lárnach í sin i gcur i bhfeidhm an phlean náisiúnta. Tá ról agamsa mar Choimisinéir Teanga tráchtaireacht a dhéanamh ar obair an choiste chomhairligh. Tá an plean náisiúnta lárnach ann. Tá ceist an tsoláthair lárnach ann. Tuigeann an Teachta é son ón obair uilig a rinne sé ar an ollscolaíocht Ghaeilge agus tuigim é ó mo ról féin san am atá imithe sular thosaigh mé ag obair le hOifig an Choimisinéara Teanga. Tá deis ag an earnáil tríú leibhéal breathnú ar scála an riachtanais de 20% agus na pleananna gnímh a chur i dtoll a chéile. Chomh maith le iachall a bheith ar ollscoileanna é a dhéanamh, nó riachtanas a bheith ann go ndéanfaidís é, tá deis ag earnáil na hollscolaíochta Gaeilge bheith réamhghníomhach. Ba cheart go mbreathnóidís ar na deiseanna atá ann cur le soláthar as cuimse agus na hacmhainní atá ar fáil do na hinstitiúidí a mhéadú mar sprioc straitéiseach náisiúnta de chuid na hinstitiúide. Táimid ag caint faoin tseirbhís poiblí anseo agus ar sholáthar trí Ghaeilge. Tá an earnáil ollmhór. Tá faoi bhun 400,000 duine ag obair inti. Tá riachtanas 20% d'earcaithe idir 2022 agus 2030 i gceist. Tá an scála dúshlánach ach ceapaim go gcaithfear dualgas a leagadh agus freisin, go dteastaíonn réamhghníomhacht agus uaillmhian le freastal ar an sprioc sin.",
                "Mar a luaigh mé ar ball, is dóigh liom go bhfuil deis stairiúil againn. Is é seo an chéad uair atá plean náisiúnta reachtúil ar leith dírithe ar sholáthar seirbhísí poiblí laistigh den earnáil seo. Tá an-bhéim leagtha agam ar chomhoibriú idir uillinneacha éagsúla an Stáit. Tá a fhios agam gur fhreastail an Teachta ar an gcomhdháil pleanála teanga a bhí i bPáirc an Chrócaigh le cúpla lá anuas. I mo phíosa cainte inné, leag mé béim ar an tábhacht a bhaineann le comhoibriú idir earnáil na pleanála teanga agus feidhmiú na cearta teanga tríd an mbonneagar náisiúnta. Tá airgead mhór infheistithe ag an Stát sa phleanáil teanga ó 2012 ar aghaidh. Feicim go bhféadfaí feabhas a chur ar go leor de na seirbhísí atá ag teastáil agus pacáistiú níos fearr a dhéanamh orthu ionas go mbeadh fáil ag an bpobal teanga orthu ar an láthair. Luaigh mé go sonrach molchampais nó champais ilfhreastail. Níl aon chúis nach mbeadh an cineál oiliúna atá ag teastáil ó oibrithe sa tseirbhís phoiblí ag tarlú sa gcomhthéacs sin ó thaobh campais ilfhreastail agus mar sin de, agus go gcothófaí pobal. Tá an ceart ag an Teachta go bhfuil na blianta tosaigh criticiúil. Tá dualgas ar na hinstitiúidí agus ar an earnáil ardoideachas. Caithfidh na hinstitiúdí a fheiceáil go bhfuil deis-----"

                "Go dtí seo, is trí scéim teanga a bheith aontaithe idir Aire na Gaeltachta agus an comhlacht poiblí go mbeadh seirbhísí líne á gcur ar fáil. Tá deireadh le teacht le córas na scéimeanna teanga mar gheall go raibh easpa leanúnachais agus soiléireachta ag baint leis an tseirbhís a bhí le cur ar fáil. Is é córas nua na gcaighdeán teanga a réiteoidh an bhearna maidir le seirbhís ar líne. Thagair mé do roinnt samplaí praiticiúla ar nós MyGovID, seirbhísí bunúsacha a riarann an caidreamh idir an Stát agus an saoránach ó lá go lá. Má scrúdaítear an soláthar atá ar fáil trí Bhéarla ansin i gcomparáid leis an soláthar trí Ghaeilge, tá sé an-deacair an cás a dhéanamh go bhfuil cothrom na Féinne á thabhairt do phobal na Gaeilge. Is í an chaoi a rachfar i ngleic leis sin ná go leagfar síos go mbeidh dualgas ar chomhlachtaí poiblí nó ar aicme de chomhlachtaí poiblí seirbhísí idirghníomhacha ar líne a chur ar fáil ar chomhchaighdeán i nGaeilge agus i mBéarla.",

Cé go bhfuil go leor seirbhísí ag bogadh ar líne, leis an tseirbhís a fháil go minic bíonn ar dhuine labhairt le fostaí sa chomhlacht poiblí. Is é an taithí atá ann i gcuid mhaith cásanna faoi láthair, faraor, ná go gcliseann an tseirbhís nuair a bhítear ag brath ar labhairt le fostaí sa chomhlacht poiblí. Arís, is é córas na gcaighdeán teanga nua a leagfaidh síos cén tseirbhís phoiblí a chaithfidh comhlacht poiblí a chur ar fáil agus cén cumas teanga a chaithfidh a bheith ag na baill foirne a bheidh á gcur sin ar fáil.",

Cheapfainn ag an bpointe seo d'fheidhmiú an reachtaíocht teanga go bhfuil díomá orainn nach bhfuil seirbhísí chomh bunúsach mar sin níos fearr. Tá dúshláin ann maidir leis na caighdeáin teanga agus táim dóchasach go rachaidh na caighdeáin teanga i bhfeidhm ar na bearnaí atá luaite ag an Teachta. Caithfear iad a chur i bhfeidhm taobh istigh d'achar gearr de bhlianta. Táimid tar éis an-bhéim a leagan sa tráchtaireacht atá á dhéanamh againn ar chothrom na Féinne agus ar mhuinín an phobail i seirbhísí Stáit. Thagraíomar go sonrach do straitéisí atá ag foilsithe ag an Stát maidir le muinín an phobail i seirbhísí poiblí go ginearálta, i mBéarla agus i nGaeilge, a chothú. Tá luachanna ansin atá luaite go sonrach ar nós iontaobhais, freagrúlachta agus oscailteachta maidir leis na seirbhísí atá le cur ar fáil. Caithfear na luachanna sin a thabhairt isteach i lár na pleanála do na seirbhísí trí mheán na Gaeilge atá le cur ar fáil agus le feabhsú. Tá sé sin dlite ag an bpobal teanga go mbeadh na bunluachanna a chinntíonn go bhfuil freastal cuí á dhéanamh ar an bpobal i mBéarla nó i nGaeilge comhionann. Tá trácht déanta agam ar an méid go minic.",

This year, the building blocks expansion scheme is funding reconfigurations of services to enable them to increase the number of places, particularly for one- to three-year-olds. I will launch the building blocks extension scheme soon, which will make €25 million available next year in large-scale capital grants for services to undertake building projects to increase their capacity. Again, this will primarily be focused on places for one- to three-year-olds. Funding will also be available to existing community services to purchase or construct new premises.",

Between year one and year two of the scheme, the number of hours of services delivered annually increased by almost 8%. Further capacity growth of approximately 6% is built into the forecasting of the scheme for year three, which began earlier this month.",

In budget 2025, I secured an additional €15 million to support employers to meet the costs of further increases to the minimum rates of pay in the sector. This translates into full-year costs of €45 million. Recruiting and retaining staff is crucially important to maintaining and growing capacity. In addition, I am increasing the availability of regulated and subsidised early learning and childcare. Following the commencement of new regulations on 30 September, parents who use childminders will soon be able to access the national childcare scheme.",

To this end, I have initiated work on a forward planning model that will identify the number of early learning and childcare places in different categories in each service, whether or not those places are occupied and how that aligns with the numbers of children in the corresponding age cohorts at local level."

However, the 33,000 children who need a childcare place today cannot wait for the capital projects and extensions, which, in many cases, I presume, will require planning permission. Some providers have the physical space needed but they have closed rooms because they cannot get the staff. They physically cannot staff those rooms. In order to build capacity, we really need, number one, to look at the wages in the sector and we also must be innovative in looking at existing buildings. As I have said previously, I can think of several community centres in my own area that are either vacant all of the time or underused during the day. We need to look at existing buildings in our communities, which could be used as shared spaces, rather than looking for capital funding and planning permission to build. The other issue is buildings that have already been built as part of housing developments but are left idle."

That will already be delivering additional places. The Deputy is absolutely right regarding existing buildings. The new capital scheme I am set to announce in the next number of weeks will allow community services, in particular, to purchase existing buildings. They might be unused ones, as she mentioned, or buildings that were provided in housing developments. The scheme was designed to be flexible to allow for that. Community services can get the full cost of the buildings for private providers. It is a 50:50 arrangement, which is an appropriate division between the State stepping up with support and private providers bringing some resources themselves.",

The Government has financed two pay increases through an ERO process. They were the first ever mandated pay increases for early learning professionals."

It could not be done around the table, with workers having to seek assistance from the Labour Court. If they wait another 14 months and get about 60 cent, we will lose the early years educators we desperately need from the sector. There are childcare places that would be available if the providers could staff the rooms, particularly baby rooms. I have seen that in my county of Roscommon, where baby rooms have been closed because the providers cannot get the staff. If we have to wait 14 months for a pay increase for early years educators, given the rise in the living wage that is coming, there will be about 15 cent in the difference between the minimum rate for those workers and the living wage. That is of huge concern if we are to build capacity within the sector.",

It was disappointing that it took 14 months last time. I was very clear in what I announced yesterday that the allocation for staff pay is dependent on the ERO. The money will only flow to the services if we have that ERO in place. People working in the services say to me when I meet them that staffing is their biggest pressure. We are stepping up with money to support staff pay but I am very clear that we need the ERO in place. We are saying this now to ensure there is plenty of time for the process to kick-start and deliver on time. I and whoever succeeds me in my role must be very clear that we want to support that. As we go forward on an annual basis, we hope to provide an additional core funding allocation just for pay, which will subsequently translate into a pay increase for our amazing childcare professionals."

I believe the two years of ECCE should be legislated for on a statutory basis, so that every child has the right to access ECCE. Second, I believe that in areas of high capacity, the State now needs to step in and look at providing services directly. A combined model of public provision, community provision and private provision can work for the delivery of childcare everywhere. Third, the issue of staff pay is absolutely fundamental. That will require continued investment. I have more than doubled investment in childcare in the past four years. That is an important step forward but there is still a long way to go to bring us in line with other European countries in terms of what we invest in early years. Much as been achieved in four years. We now have an opportunity in the general election campaign to set out a vision for early years in the next five to ten years."

I hope that will be evidence to the Deputy and to others that we are learning and always looking to design the scheme as effectively as possible.",

I will come back to the Deputy with the exact figures, if that would be useful. As she knows, there is an appeals process. Where an application for the scheme is unsuccessful, the person concerned is entitled within six months of the notice of the termination of the scheme to make an appeal. That works within statutory timelines."

One of the most tragic aspects of what happened in that particular mother and baby institution was the uncertainty regarding the burial places of the many children who were resident there and the many children who we know died there and in some linked institutions. The investigation of burial arrangements in mother and baby institutions, including in Bessborough, was an important part of the work of the commission of investigation. In Bessborough, the commission carried out cartographic and landscape assessments of possible unrecorded burial arrangements. It also carried out a site survey and followed up with responses. The commission concluded that it is likely that some of the children who died in Bessborough are buried on the grounds but it was not able to find the physical or documentary evidence. As no evidence of locations was found, the commission did not consider it feasible to excavate the full available site, which now amounts to 60 acres, or the full original site, which would have been over 200 acres. Right now, I am not aware of any detailed proposals for Government funding to undertake a further survey of the Bessborough grounds. Given the scale of the current estate and the wider estate, excavation would have a significant cost and we must recognise that.",

In September, An Bord Pleanála rejected a planning application and one of the reasons it did so was that the site concerned was the potential location of a burial site on the lands."

At least 928 babies died in Bessborough but only 64 graves have been identified. The Department of local government at the time chalked the scale of infant deaths down to \"conditions associated with the unfortunate lot of the unmarried mother\". Survivors of Bessborough have never received justice from the religious orders that abused them or the State, which facilitated it and turned a blind eye. The very least the State owes survivors is to find the bodies of their children. We need an investigation of the grounds to establish the location of the remains of the babies and to conduct a sensitive excavation and a dignified exhumation of any of the remains.

In 1960, 18-year-old Madeleine Walsh was sent to Bessborough. Her baby son, William, fell ill when he was three days old and was taken from her. He died when he was six weeks old. After years of requests for information, she was informed by nuns that he lay in an unmarked grave at Bessborough folly. She visited that spot for years to be near her son and to speak to him until 2019, when the fifth interim report revealed that the nuns had lied. William had actually been buried in an overgrown famine graveyard on Carr's Hill. There seems to be no end to the cruelty that is heaped upon these women by religious orders and the State. At every step, the Department has failed them. So many women and children who were in Bessborough have been excluded from the discriminatory redress scheme. Every woman who was forced to scrub floors, do laundry and clean nappies, day in and day out until her hands were raw, is completely excluded from the work-related payment.",

The data available shows that the level of capacity in the sector has risen substantially in recent years. However, I am aware that nationally, and in my own constituency as well, some parents are having difficulty in locating the type of affordable early learning and care provision they would like for their children. That is particularly acute for younger children.",

The extension scheme will mean €25 million of capital funding is available next year to deliver thousands of new affordable early learning and childcare places. It will offer funding for larger-scale projects to enable both existing community services and private services to build new capacity into their current premises by means of physical extension. It will also allow existing community services to apply to purchase or construct entirely new premises.",

My Department will continue to progress a range of actions, such as core funding and the recently launched initiative for childminders, to ensure the supply of early learning and childcare meets demand. Work in this area is being led by a supply management unit which I established in my Department earlier this year.",

That happens but as the childcare facility often is not delivered or is not designed appropriately, we are looking to revise those regulations and I hope that we will bring forward drafts soon."

The first step towards doing that is to provide that statutory right to ECCE as 95% of children get ECCE right now but it is not a legal right. If you enshrine it in law, it places a greater emphasis on the next Government to ensure those places are delivered as the core of early learning and care."

I fully agree we should support and encourage such values in the sector. I am well aware that many providers are motivated by a desire to educate, support and work with children rather than by profit and that they reinvest surpluses into their businesses. There are challenges with depending on the social enterprise model, particularly given that such enterprises do not have a distinct legal form. The partnership approach developed under the new funding model, however, is designed to move in this direction and has been very successful.

For €20,000, it is not a lot. I think doing that job of work of identifying spaces where childcare could be incorporated would be really worthwhile because when they are in a shared space, it keeps costs down, rent is shared and electricity is shared. It makes a difference, particularly in rural communities where it has not been viable for a private provider to step in. We could look at the social enterprise model in filling those gaps that exist. You are using buildings that are there and that are underused, bringing them back into life and then providing a service in a community where that service otherwise might not exist. Spraoi agus Spórt, Carndonagh, is a really good example of this. It is an award-winning social enterprise model.

Should we be relying on a social enterprise model, even with additional State supports, to step in, or is the best way to guarantee capacity, particularly in those areas of undersupply, for the State to step in directly? Personally, I am coming to the latter view, that we have done as much as we can with the existing model and brought a lot of improvements but it still has real challenges. That more active role for the State as the focus of the next government, whatever government it is, is probably the best way forward."

It will do the job of work of identifying those buildings where there is existing capacity and where childcare could be brought into those buildings. In some cases they are not used at all. I think that would be a worthwhile job of work and would be a way in which we could build capacity quickly within the sector. The social enterprise model has been proven to work already. For a small amount of money, I think it would be very worthwhile to do that mapping exercise as to where we could get increased capacity quickly, having a look at that and perhaps the Minister engaging with Social Enterprise Ireland himself."

Where is the Minister's thinking, based on the Taoiseach's comments, around the idea that we align early-years and preschool provision with primary and post-primary education, whereby the State intervenes to pay staff within the system; the providers remain as they are or retain their autonomy, so to speak, but the sector is funded by the State; terms and conditions of employment are robust; there is not this constant attrition of workers within the model as it stands; and the model is formalised in a way that ensures that it becomes robust and part of the education system into the future?"

The primary goal in 2025 is to ensure there is funding for more children to take up the NCS. That will grow to 214,000 children using the NCS next year. When I started, 44,000 were using the NCS, so there has been massive growth over the last four years.",

There will be an increased allocation for providers in order that we can maintain the fee freeze, have more for administration and meet the much lower costs of inflation next year. We also have a separate dedicated allocation that will be paid out on foot of a new pay agreement between providers and staff that I hope will be negotiated next year. There is €15 million allocated for 2025; it will be €45 million over the full core year. That will allow for a pay increase, but the allocation will not be paid out until that pay increase is negotiated.",

From next September, as well as getting lower staff ratios, we will be providing support for meals for those services.

I know the Minister spends much time, as I do in a neighbouring constituency, dealing with families who effectively make a second mortgage payment for their childcare needs. I commend the funding coming in to reduce that cost by over €1,000 in the calendar year, which is fantastic news, but we have to have a conversation.",

The Department is doing important work with the Department of housing to look at the regulations and, particularly, enforcement.

We are going to have to consolidate that range of accommodation where there are contractual issues but we are also going to have to consolidate it in terms of scale because we have empty beds and I do not think anybody would agree that the State should be paying for empty beds. That consolidation will require moves and some of them will be hard. This is something I will have to recognise in terms of the €2 billion put aside for refugee accommodation next year.

It is currently envisaged that the potential handover of this site will begin in mid-October and will be completed by December. Building on this work, a procurement process to form a framework for the delivery of modular prefabricated units on State land has been launched. We have also set out an expression of interest for people who want to sell the State large sites that can also be used for the accommodation of international protection applicants.",

We will also use additional capital funding my Department has received from the Department of public expenditure under the review of the NDP to purchase sites that have been offered on the private market. There are larger institutional buildings that can be refurbished and used for international protection accommodation as well."

Direct provision was the least impactful. For the Taoiseach of the country to perpetuate that narrative is unacceptable.

In year one, funding was allocated according to the number of hours and the number of children that a service had but we recognised after year one that smaller services were disadvantaged by that. In year two, we brought in two changes. We brought in a minimum floor of core funding below which no service would go, including even very small services. We also brought in a sessional-only rate for services that do ECCE only so they would get an additional payment. In year three, we significantly increased these so the floor rate is €14,000 and no service gets less than that under core funding. The minimum payment for sessional services is now €5,000. The big change in year three of the model was the application for a fee increase. Prior to that we had frozen everyone's fees at 2021 levels but recognising some services last raised their fees a number of years earlier, we wanted to make the opportunity for them to apply to raise their fees."

There have been indications from the Minister and from other senior figures within the Government that we should look towards public provision as well. That begs the next question of how we see those pieces of the jigsaw come together where we will get community childcare facilities, for-profit facilities, which will remain part of the picture, and how public provision of childcare provision begins to stitch into that. Are we moving more in that direction? What we have done under the core funding model is a significant step in terms of the State being involved seriously in the provision of childcare for the first time. Where do we go from here? What is the roadmap? Where do we see public provision fit in as part of this overall jigsaw?"

Some parents, other than the two years ECCE scheme, do not want or have any further need of early learning and care. Other parents need a lot more. How that is provided, whether it is through a fantastic private provider, a fantastic community provider or potentially a fantastic State provider, should be a choice we give to parents. What concerns me right now is that there are parts of the country where parents do not have a choice because the capacity is not there. The private and the community providers are not able to provide that and that is where the State needs to step up now in the direct delivery of childcare. It will not be replacing community or private providers; it will be alongside them, supplementing them and ensuring every child has the opportunity to enjoy high quality and affordable early learning and care."

The Government committed in the programme for Government to supporting parents, including by extending paid leave for parents to allow them to spend more time with their baby during the first year.",
                    "Under the Parent’s Leave and Benefit Act 2019, working parents are entitled to nine weeks of paid parent's leave for each relevant parent, to be taken in the first two years after the birth or adoptive placement of a child, as required by the work-life balance directive. It was two weeks per parent per child when I became Minister, and it is now nine weeks.",
                    "It is important to note that the entitlement under the 2019 Act is for each parent in his or her own right so it is not allocated per family. The Act was drafted to take account of the broad complexion of family life, including one-parent families, and allows for an entitlement for the spouse, civil partner or cohabitant of the parent. Parents do not have to cohabit to be eligible for the entitlement. However, the leave is not transferable to ensure that fathers as well as mothers are supported in their caring roles and to support women's equal labour market participation. That principle of non-transferability that was built into the work-life balance directive is required because of the importance of ensuring that the provision of family leave does not serve to disadvantage mothers participating in the workforce.",

To the extent that the matter falls within my Department, I have always committed to working with colleagues to support one-parent families through the development of enhanced, targeted supports. For example, the national childcare scheme includes an income-related subsidy, alongside the universal subsidy, which aims to make childcare more affordable for low-income families, including lone-parent families. An independent review of NCS in 2021 indicated that single parents received greatest benefit from the scheme as they received the highest subsidies."

Despite all of that, regarding the one-parent family, if a baby is born into a one-parent family and the other parent is deceased, for example, there will be nine additional weeks; but for a baby born into a two-parent family there will be 18 weeks. That is not fair and we should have equality on this. It would be for a very small number of babies but regardless of the parent-family make-up, whether one- or two-parent, the entitlement for the baby should be the same. At this point, one-parent families are losing out on nine weeks. The partner may have passed away. It is important to have the equal entitlement whether it is a one- or two-parent family.

That is important. Where the parent with custody has a new partner, that partner may also avail of this leave.

                "The parents of children with scoliosis and spina bifida who have been waiting years for operations would have been listening intently to the Taoiseach's budget yesterday. They would have been listening in the hope that he might finally hear their calls for action and deliver the investment and change that their children so desperately need so that they might get their surgeries to end the nightmare of being stuck on a waiting list or struck off one. Although the budget book has 168 pages, there is no mention of these children with scoliosis and spina bifida, nor a single line outlining a specific solution.",
                "Despite the hype around this budget, children with scoliosis will continue to wait in pain, to deteriorate and to run out of time. I am speaking about children like 13-year-old Darragh Higgins from Galway. Darragh was born with spina bifida and has been waiting for surgery for five years. He has been lost in a system that has failed him. His condition is ever-worsening. His spinal curve is now 120°. His mother Keara posted a video on social media last week telling Darragh's story. Darragh's scoliosis is now crushing his lungs, his bowels and his heart. Keara, his mother, tweeted \"My son never had heart issues until his scoliosis was left to crush his body!\" She is worried and terrified. Her big fear is that Darragh will become inoperable, just as other children have become inoperable as they waited and waited. Keara has been waiting for surgical intervention, a surgical plan and communication on her son's scoliosis treatment for far too long. He has been assessed for surgery in the United States but there is still no clarity as to if or when Darragh will have the operation and if it will go ahead. There is no clarity on travel plans, costs or length of stay. They have been given nothing in writing and are now wracked with uncertainty.",
                "There are concerns that if Darragh and other children with spinal curvatures and complex medical needs travel, they might be asked to do so in economy seats on flights. I do not know if the Taoiseach has seen Darragh's video. He has. He could not possibly expect a young lad in that situation to be crammed into an economy seat for a transatlantic flight. Some children like Darragh have to be repositioned so they do not get pressure sores that would prevent them from getting the surgery they need when they land in America. This needs to be sorted out pronto.",
                "As Members will know, last week, ahead of the budget, parents of children with scoliosis and spina bifida came to a briefing in the Oireachtas audiovisual room. A 14-year-old boy, a wonderful young man called Tommy Long, addressed the meeting. During his time on the waiting list, this child has been through it all. He said that it was extremely disappointing to have seen no improvement for him or for the hundreds of other children with scoliosis over the last ten years.",
                "Mar thoradh ar an mbuiséad seo, leanfaidh leanaí le scoliosis agus spina bifida ag fulaingt agus iad ag fanacht ar obráidí. Here is my question for the Taoiseach. He made no mention of these children in his budget. Where is the funding to finally deliver on the promise that no child would wait? That promise was made a long time ago and has been broken many times. Where is the money to make sure that Darragh gets to the United States and gets the treatment he needs? Where are the funding and resources to look after all of the other children who are currently suffering in agony?"

                "I thank the Deputy very much for raising this issue. It is very important and I am pleased that we are raising it in this House. Nobody in the House wants to see any child wait in pain. Any suggestion from the Deputy that she does not but that I am somehow or other satisfied with children being left in pain is obviously not a fair portrayal of me or of any public representative in this House. This is not an issue that divides political opinion. I assure her that, if she was in my role, she would be doing what I am doing, which is to meet the clinical lead and the head of the HSE to work through the issues with them. If she wishes, I will arrange for the Deputy to meet with the clinician in charge of this programme for scoliosis because, while I am very happy to address the issue on the floor of the House, I often find it difficult to discuss children's individual clinical care plans here. I believe the Deputy would have difficulty with me doing so because there is a role for politicians and there is a role for clinicians. That is an important thing to say.",
                "I will be really clear at the outset. Let us not be disingenuous. The Deputy has been at Leaders' Questions a hell of a lot longer than I have been and she will know that the HSE budget is detailed in a service plan. She knows that is where the line-by-line detail is found. If she wishes, she can choose to use her time to suggest that Government does not care about an issue. That is fine. Perhaps it is even her job. It is not accurate, however. The HSE will now work through the level of funding it has received from the Government with the Minister for Health and will produce the detailed HSE service plan. That is how it has worked every year the Deputy has been in this House. It is how it will work this year as well. Let me be very clear; the agreement that the Ministers, Deputies Donohoe and Donnelly, reached for health this year is very significant. It brings the total health budget to €25.6 billion. It means that health spending has doubled over the last decade and that staffing will have increased by 30%. It also means that there will be a real opportunity to make progress on all waiting lists, as we have been doing in recent years.",
                "It also means that there will be further ability to invest more in paediatric spinal waiting lists. The Minister has told families, doctors, the HSE and this House that any resources required by the dedicated spinal unit he has established will be provided, and I fully support him on that. That has been the case up to now. I have met with the Minister, the CEO of the HSE and the clinical lead of the dedicated spinal unit. This is now being led by a clinical lead, Mr. David Moore. I have also met with their teams and I know that every possible avenue and resource is being put to use.",
                "The Minister is now chairing a monthly meeting with the HSE and Children's Health Ireland on the waiting times and ensuring everything can be done. A paediatric spinal task force has been established with an independent chair, Mark Connaughton SC. We are committing significant additional investment to help to tackle waiting lists and ease the burden. This has resulted in a significant increase in the number of paediatric spinal procedures carried out in 2022 and 2023. So far this year, more than 300 spinal procedures have taken place. It is important to acknowledge that. For every child the Deputy names, and she is absolutely right to highlight them, there are children getting these operations at a scale and a pace that was not the case in years gone by. As she knows, additional funding of €1.34 million was allocated when the new clinical lead requested it, and anything the new clinical lead requests will be provided for in the HSE's budget for the time ahead.",
                "The Deputy raises a very important, specific issue and I welcome her raising it. I agree with her in relation to the difference between economy and business class and ensuring that Darragh or anybody travelling has the space to travel safely and appropriately. An arrangement with Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital in New York has been finalised. Consultants from New York have travelled to this country to see patients at a clinic in Dublin. Following a clinic held in Dublin with surgeons from Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, a group of patients has also been offered treatment abroad and this is now in progress. An arrangement is also being finalised with the Portland Hospital in the UK. I am assured families will be fully supported in accessing these pathways if it is the right option for their children. A support package will be put in place to support them in travelling, including flights, accommodation, transport and travel insurance for all those in the travelling party. Quite rightly, a subsistence rate for expenses will be provided as well. I am assured that two of the flights for any family travelling will be business class. I am meeting scoliosis advocacy groups next week and I am very happy and eager to discuss all these matters."

                "I wish to raise with the Taoiseach today the question of child protection and how his Government will stand by survivors of child abuse in Irish schools and institutions. It is an issue that has been brought into light recently. Over recent years, we have gained a new understanding of the scale of the abuse perpetrated against children, in particular, across so many religious and State-run institutions through disclosures of abuse in industrial schools, orphanages, mother and baby homes and Magdalen laundries. Most recently, thanks to the immense bravery of survivors like the Ryan brothers, we have learned of the awful abuse of students and young children in a significant number of religious-run schools. We have also heard new revelations about abuse perpetrated by Bishop Eamonn Casey, among others.",
                "Each time we hear about abuse perpetrated upon children in religious-run institutions, there are calls for religious orders to step up and pay their share of redress. When the dust settles, however, the State has never really stepped up to make sure those religious organisations do pay up. I have seen this myself. As a legal practitioner previously representing survivors of abuse, I saw how many were often retraumatised by a flawed redress process, in some cases, and by religious orders’ refusal to engage. The Government and the Taoiseach have called, as have I, on religious orders to pay their share of redress. The problem is that many are hiding behind what I have called the \"developer’s wife syndrome\" - I think we are all aware of this - where orders transfer their assets to lay-run trusts, meaning the orders may be legally liable to pay redress but no longer have the means or assets to do so. Of course, the lay-run trusts have no legal liability. What makes this troubling ethically is that the assets involved are so extensive. I have seen an investigation by Noteworthy for The Journal showing that religious orders involved in historic abuse sold over 75 properties, worth more than €90 million, between 2016 and 2022 alone.",
                "As legislators, we must go beyond condemnation of abuse and appealing to the moral duty of orders. We have to review the broader issue of why we still have the bulk of schools under religious patronage and why we do not have a true separation of church and State. On the practical issue of redress, just three weeks ago, I shared with the Taoiseach a Bill that we in the Labour Party drafted to ensure religious orders would be compelled to contribute in full to redress schemes and could not hide behind any legal mechanisms or lay-run trusts. The Taoiseach said he will work with the Opposition parties on this crucial issue. Indeed, I previously welcomed the engagement of the Minister, Deputy Foley, with Opposition parties on the scoping inquiry and the commitment to statutory redress. What the Taoiseach has not confirmed is whether he will ensure that organisations that facilitated or even covered up abuse will now be compelled to pay redress. Will the Taoiseach legislate to make the orders pay their share before a general election?"

I could not agree more with the Deputy. The issue of child protection is the most important one. Child abuse is something that sickens everybody to the very gut of their stomach. It absolutely does. I thank the Deputy for her constructive engagement and suggestions. I assure her we will work with her and all of the Opposition in relation to getting this matter right. I think the Deputy's critique of successive governments is fair. Many of us have been in them over the years. The people in good faith try to establish inquiries and get to the bottom of things, and then it seems we are always one report away. We have had so many reports into sexual abuse. Let us be really honest. It is such a stain on our country. The pain caused by the sins of the past is destroying lives today.",

Let us be honest, they have not or certainly the overwhelming majority of them have not. The short answer is \"Yes\". We will work with the Opposition and engage with the Labour Party's legislation. An interdepartmental group was set up after the scoping inquiry into sexual abuse in schools. As part of that work, the Attorney General has been asked to consider the whole issue of how to ensure that if a redress scheme is put in place - and there needs to be a redress scheme - there will be mechanisms not just to ask nicely but to make sure that if people do not do the right thing, they will need to contribute to the scheme.",
                "In the first instance, while I know Deputy Bacik would not do so, I do not want to be misrepresented as suggesting that it is just about asking nicely or appealing to people's better nature. When people issue statements, and the religious orders did issue statements of profound regret and the likes, one would hope that they would now do the right thing. I want the Government's position to be clear, and I expect it is also the position across parties in this House, that if people do not do the right thing, we need to find legislative mechanisms to ensure that the correct thing is done.",

She has handled the issue very well and sensitively. Deputy Bacik acknowledged the engagement she has had with the Opposition. She has also had great and meaningful engagement with survivors. Making sure that the structures and mechanisms we put in place produce answers, healing, justice, accountability and appropriate redress is important. We will continue to work on this. I have no doubt, and I think I can speak for the House on this, that regardless of when there is a general election, this is something to which we will all commit to getting right and working on together."

Our Bill would facilitate civil proceedings against unincorporated bodies such as, but not confined to, religious orders and would provide for the recovery of any damages awarded from associated trusts of such bodies. It is critical legislation and is needed to ensure that we do right by survivors of abuse. Again, I commend the immense bravery of those survivors who have come forward and condemn perpetrators of abuse. We are all conscious that abuse was not confined to religious-run organisations. Abuse, unfortunately, against children has happened in all sorts of settings and we must all condemn it outright wherever it occurs and do right by survivors. There are some specific actions we can adopt, like the Bill we have proposed and like, for example, honouring those survivors of abuse by Bishop Casey who have called for the removal of his remains from the crypt in Galway Cathedral. These are significant actions that can be taken to do justice by survivors and all of us, in government and opposition, should be committing to do so."

We have seen in the past when we have got mechanisms correct that we have provided people with answers and a degree of healing.

Both the President and the Prime Minister of Palestine thanked me, our Government and the people of Ireland for what we are doing in relation to Palestine. I come back here and I come into this Dáil and the Deputy's distortion of what the Government is doing is actually breathtaking, in terms of how he distorts the record of this Government. It is breathtaking. President Abbas thanks the Government and people of Ireland for our position but Deputy Boyd Barrett comes in here and constantly endeavours to misrepresent it. The Government's position is clear and the people of Ireland's position is clear in relation to the humanitarian catastrophe that is happening in Gaza. We are very clear in relation to the breaches of international law. We are very clear in relation to the ICJ ruling and in relation to the actions we took arising from that ruling in the context of defence equipment. Please do not attempt to misrepresent the Government of the people of Ireland in terms of our position in relation to this. The President of the Palestinian Authority understands it and, quite frankly, what he thinks of our record on Palestine matters to me a hell of a lot more than what Deputy Boyd Barrett thinks and how he wishes to misrepresent our record.",
                "I note that in his comments - unless I missed it - that the Deputy did not condemn Iran and did not condemn what happened last night. A civilian is a civilian. International law is international law. We cannot just pick and choose if we like this country or do not like that country. What Iran did last night should be condemned by Deputy Boyd Barrett when he rises to his feet again and should be condemned by this House because we condemn other acts of aggression on a regular basis. Presumably, we wish to apply international law regardless of the country or our political stance on an issue. What Iran did last night was a despicable act that should be condemned by all. Had the air dome failed, we would be dealing with mass civilian deaths in Tel Aviv and in Jerusalem-----"

What would he have said if those Iranian missiles had landed last night? What would he have done? Would he have engaged in a bit of whataboutery? What Iran did last night is dangerous and should be condemned. What Israel has done in relation to Lebanon should be condemned. I am clear on that.

I can assure the House, because I am sure this is to the fore of the Deputy's mind and it certainly is to mine, that the safety of those troops is the absolute paramount concern for this Government and for the people of Ireland.

This is a critical service and a matter of life and death for the 600,000 people in the south east who rely on University Hospital Waterford. We have seen the tragic consequences of this unmet need through stories like that of Tom Power and Una McDermott, and the data exposed by the \"RTÉ Investigates\" team. An entire community marched in protest. Some 22,000 people took to the streets of Waterford in 2013. The issue is not new nor is the frustration.",
                "The Taoiseach has a legacy here. As Minister for Health in 2016, he commissioned the Herity report, a document so riddled with errors that the word \"clinical\" was misspelled on the front page. It was hastily thrown together, deliberately misinformed, marred by dodgy and incorrect data and is still used to shield inaction. When the flaws of that report became apparent, as Minister for Health in 2016 he commissioned the national review of specialist cardiac care services led by Philip Nolan. For the past six years we have been told to wait for that review. The report remains buried on the desk of the Minister for Health. Promises have been made and recycled. The Taoiseach's colleague the Tánaiste, Micheál Martin, stood for a photo in Waterford in 2016 promising 24-7 cardiac care for the south east, a promise that played a role in his party's regaining a seat in the region. Standing beside him was the now Minister of State at the Department of Health, the main beneficiary of that promise. Last November on WLR's Damien Tiernan show, the Minister of State assured us that recruitment for a seven-day service would begin in January. In March, she had to return to assure us that recruitment would start in June. Again she returned and again nothing has happened. The promises are repeated but the people of Waterford wait.",

In his response, I ask the Taoiseach to limit his comments to the issue of 24-7 cardiac care. This is not about political point scoring. It is about fulfilling commitments made to a community. The Taoiseach now holds the levers of power and has the legacy on the issue. I ask him to expunge this wrong and show the people of the south east that politics can work for them."

The medium- to long-term options for recovery beds are now being discussed with the HSE, involving the relocation of the on-call residents and refurbishment of this area. The opening hours for the first cath lab were also extended in September 2022. Permission has now been granted to recruit a specific group of staff for the initial tranche for 2024. It is now an operational issue for the HSE to do so.

Many times in the House I have heard the Taoiseach mention and reference that the Government wants to leave nobody behind. We are leaving a whole region behind. We do not need a report to tell us what is needed in the south east. We have the testimony of the McDermott family and the Power family. We have many other testimonies of people who had delayed cardiac care and are suffering as a result. I ask the Taoiseach please to implement this. I remind him that the HSE recruitment embargo stopped the recruitment of the seven-day service by not bringing those people forward. They were emergency personnel. Why were they included in the embargo? I ask the Taoiseach to get the Department and the Government to stop dragging their feet and deliver this equality issue to the south east."

There are 49 more consultant doctors, 114 more NCHDs, 378 more nurses and midwives, as well as 118 more health and social care professionals. In 2019 the hospital in Waterford had a budget of €201 million. In 2024 the budget is more than €309 million. The budget has grown during the lifetime of the Government by €108 million. I accept there is work to do, I really do, but I do want people to know there has been more than €100 million of additional investment, significant extra staff increases and the expansion of our cardiac services. In light of Deputy Shanahan raising the issue today I will seek an update from HSE chief executive and come back to him directly on it."

                "I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on budget 2025. I am very proud to commend this budget to the House. As my first budget as Taoiseach, and the last budget of this Government, I believe it a fitting balance between building on progress, helping people in the here and now and pointing the way to a more secure future.",
                "This budget comes at a critical juncture. It comes at a time when people have been strained by a prolonged cost-of-living crisis and while businesses have struggled in the face of rising costs after a series of economic shocks. We have, therefore, put in place a budget that is all about solidarity and security. There is solidarity with people who are struggling with high prices and the cost of raising their family, with those who want to be able to own their homes, and with those families who are waiting for an assessment of need for their child or need help with the cost of school or college. There is more help for carers and older people and a package of measures targeted at alleviating child poverty. We are trying to give working families a break on their tax bills and help with the cost of childcare. There are additional measures to support small businesses and farmers, the job creators and food producers who are the backbone of our economy. It is a record budget for law and order to make sure anti-social behaviour and crime are tackled by increased numbers of gardaí, there are more efficient courts to deliver justice more swiftly and there are more prison places to get criminals off the streets.",
                "My vision is for the strong economic performance we have nurtured to yield benefits in the daily lives of working families, businesses and farmers the length and breadth of this great country, and to lay the foundations of a more secure future. People want to know their children will get the best start in life, that childcare will be available and affordable, that children who need additional care will get it, that they will be supported through school and college, and that when they become ready to own their own homes, they can do so. Most of all, we can no longer tolerate the reality of children living in poverty and this budget takes real and genuine important steps on the path to eliminating it. Deputy McDonald should ask the Children's Rights Alliance when she has finished shaking her head.",
                "In the clamour of budget day, it can be easy to forget that the progress which allows us to set these goals was certainly not guaranteed. It was not guaranteed we would have good choices to make and to make people's lives better. When I first became a TD for Wicklow, the IMF was in town. In my first budget as a TD, the choices facing the Government were limited to bad or worse. Our unemployment rate then was 15%. Today it is 4.3%. We have not got to the position we are in today because of a bit of luck or chance. It is because of the hard work of the Irish people, of Irish businesses and good decisions along the way by successive Governments.",
                "For the Opposition, nothing is ever enough. Every problem is just an opportunity to spread blame and not to try to work together on the solutions our country needs. In this budget, I believe we have struck the right balance. Using the record proceeds at our disposal, we are seeking to respond to the scale of the challenge people are facing with a significant cost-of-living package, an income tax reduction package and a record capital investment programme to invest in housing, healthcare, schools and so many other areas, in the long-term interests of our citizens. People want to feel secure. They want to have economic security to make a good living and pay the bills, and they want to look forward to this same security for their own children. This budget moves us in the right direction because it helps in the here and now. It invests in vital infrastructure now. It also sets aside billions of euro to ensure that future generations are never again caught up in the boom-bust cycle that has blighted this country in the past.",
                "My message to people listening at home is that we know the cost of living is still a real issue for you and your family. Many people feel their personal finances are insecure and might not withstand any further shock. We need to give you a sense of security that the Government gets this. This budget means that your bills and your taxes will go down and your family can keep more of your hard-earned money. In the budget we hare helping with the cost of raising a family by providing two double child benefit payments before Christmas. We are also providing €250 in energy credits and increasing the weekly rate for maternity, paternity, adoptive and parental benefit. We are increasing the working family payment threshold. We are extending hot school meals to all primary school children. We are increasing weekly social welfare rates. We are also increasing weekly child support payments, previously called the IQC, the largest single increase in this payment to tackle child poverty. We are reducing the cost of education through providing schoolbooks for all senior cycle students and cutting college fees by €1,000. We are increasing student grant thresholds by 15% and waiving the State exam fee for another year. We are also making public transport free for children aged eight and under.",
                "We are also ensuring that those who need help get it by increasing the weekly payments to carers and increasing the thresholds to ensure more carers will qualify. We are extending the carer's benefit to self-employed people and enabling carer's allowance to be made a qualifying payment for the fuel allowance. We are increasing the domiciliary care allowance for children with disabilities. We are increasing significantly the number of special needs assistants and special education teachers. We are increasing provision for residential services, home support packages and children's services, including crucial additional funding for assessment of needs.",
                "We are helping older people by increasing weekly pension rates, extending the fuel allowance to people over 66 years of age and providing a universal companion travel pass to all those aged over 70. We are helping students and younger people by, as I have said, reducing the student contribution fee again this year. We are also waiving the State exam fee and extending reduced costs for public transport for another 12 months. We are also increasing the rent tax credit to €1,000.",
                "We are taking further steps towards eradicating child poverty by increasing weekly rates of child support payments by €4 for children aged under 12 and by €8 for children aged over 12, bringing them to €62 per week for those aged over 12 and €50 per week for those aged under 12. This is the largest ever increase applied to this payment. We are extending hot school meals to all primary school children and providing two double child benefit payments. We are also addressing holiday hunger. If we accept a child needs a school meal when the school is open, the child still needs to be fed when the school is shut. We are providing funding for Equal Start, and I acknowledge the leadership of the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, on this, to target measures to ensure children experiencing disadvantage can access and participate fully in early learning and childcare.",
                "We are putting more money back in your pocket through reduced taxes. The average worker will benefit by more than €900 through the income tax and USC changes announced in this budget. This budget is another step towards reaching my ambition that nobody earning below €50,000 should pay the higher rate of income tax. This follows successive budgets that have substantially improved the take-home pay of an average worker and it is being done it in a fair way. A single parent on €36,000 has seen their take-home pay increase by 15%, while higher-earning couples have seen their take-home pay increase by 5%.",
                "We are cutting inheritance tax, so that someone can pass on an asset to a son or daughter tax-free up to €400,000. We are ensuring active farmers are not penalised for farming their land, with changes to the residential zoned land tax that enable us to bring in a tax on land hoarders.",
                "We are also extending mortgage interest relief, worth up to €250, by another year.",
                "We are backing business by providing a €4,000 energy subsidy scheme; increasing the VAT thresholds for small businesses and the self-employed; changing the self-employed earned income tax credit to allow them keep more of their hard-earned money; making changes to the capital gains tax retirement relief to help families transfer a business to the next generation; making it more attractive for investors to invest in innovative start-ups; enhancing the start-up relief for new small companies, making it easier for small, owner-managed start-ups to survive and grow; and putting in place a €20 million fund to help upskill staff with €8 million targeted at smaller businesses. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Burke, will also announce a review of the cost base of businesses because we have got to help our small and medium businesses with that cost base.",
                "We are backing farmers by increasing funding for tillage, beef, sheep and dairy, with provision of €11 million to beef farmers to bring total funding under the national beef welfare scheme from €50 per calf to €75 per calf. Taken with the CAP-funded suckler carbon efficiency programme, SCEP, total funding per suckler cow is now €225. There is provision of €24 million to the sheep sector, delivering a total fund of €25 per ewe, up from €20 this year; close to a doubling of funds to the dairy calf welfare scheme to provide €20 per calf to the breeder and a new €20 payment to the farmer who rears the calf; provision of funding to reopen the organic scheme in 2025; delivery of a tillage scheme to provide €100 per hectare payment on all sown ground in 2024; provision of initial funding of €5 million for a forgotten farmers’ scheme that will be established next year and further funded in 2026; support for animal health measures and the knowledge transfer programme, a commitment under the CAP; and a new accelerated capital allowance for farm safety will also be introduced to allow farmers investing in certain fixed farm safety items to secure an increased tax write off.",
                "We are backing law and order. This is a record budget for the Minister, Deputy McEntee, with significant increases in funding for the Garda and the Prison Service. We will recruit 1,000 more gardaí and 350 more prison officers as well as increasing prison places by 1,100. We will provide more public order equipment to help gardaí on the beat and keep them safe. We will make our courts work more quickly for victims. We will invest in our migration system to make it more efficient and work faster when it comes to processing times. The Minister has secured significantly increased funding to tackle domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.",
                "Housing is undoubtedly the number one priority. This will be the biggest housing budget ever in the history of the State. The housing budget will be boosted by one-off funding from the sale of AIB shares, which will go to the Land Development Agency and to upgrading water and energy infrastructure, which are vital to the housing pipeline.",
                "We are helping renters with the cost of rent by increasing the rent tax credit to €1,000. That is €2,000 for a couple or €3,000 for three people sharing a rented property. We are helping first-time buyers by extending and expanding the help-to-buy scheme, which has already helped 50,000 individuals or couples, people in every single one of our constituencies.",
                "We are ensuring first-time buyers are prioritised over institutional investors when it comes to the purchase of new homes with further changes to stamp duty on bulk purchases. We are providing €680 million to key affordable housing schemes. We are protecting people who find themselves homeless through a 25% increase in the homelessness services budget.",
                "We know we need to build more homes, and we will. To do this, we need to invest in our water, energy and housing infrastructure, and that is exactly what this budget does. Therefore, we will allocate €1 billion to improve the water system, €1.25 billion to the Land Development Agency and €750 million to Eirgrid to improve our electricity system.",
                "The income tax and USC reduction package means the average worker will be over €916 better off. We have been accused on occasion of focusing too much on income tax reductions. For years, people on the Opposition benches attacked us for giving people tax breaks they did not need. Now, it seems most of Opposition have changed position and they agree too that people need a break when it comes to income tax thresholds and USC. Income tax reductions have been substantial and furthermore, they have been fair. That will be our approach in the years to come. It seems strange to have to debate this point every year, but I believe it should be an agreed principle that income tax bands and credits should be indexed to keep pace with the cost of living. Reducing income tax and USC in this way helps with the cost of living, encourages people to take up work and keeps our tax system competitive internationally.",
                "I also welcome that change to inheritance tax. These thresholds have not been changed since budget 2020 and this is simply a fairness measure to reflect where house prices are at. Parents can now feel more secure that they can pass on a home to their child or children without leaving them with a big tax bill.",
                "To create a more secure future, we need to settle big questions that have created uncertainty for years. This Government and this budget vow to deliver for our young people and their potential and for businesses that tell us of the need for highly skilled workers to drive growth. I am particularly pleased that this budget will now deliver multi-annual certainty on the core funding of higher education by unlocking the national training fund. This is so essential in securing the success of our third-level institutions, and to our employers to ensure the pipeline of talent is kept strong.",
                "The national training fund is a €1.5 billion multi-annual commitment of this Government that will not only boost funding for higher education institutions but will also provide upskilling pathways for many thousands of workers. In providing for multi-annual funding, we also place our further and higher education sector on the secure footing it needs to plan and prosper. The people of this country need to be ready and empowered to face the challenges of the future, and we as Government are now ensuring we are building those skills of the future to respond to those challenges.",
                "I am pleased that this budget will also continue to reduce the cost of third-level education by slashing student contribution fees and increasing student maintenance grants well above the rate of inflation. I am particularly pleased that we will see an increase in the PhD stipend to €25,000 per year. Every individual, no matter who they are, where they come from or what their parents did before them, has to have the ability to reach his or her full potential through education.",
                "I want to live in and lead a country where every child can dream and feel excited about his or her future, where every child has what he or she needs to be happy and healthy and where everyone is able to support the children in their lives to feel loved, included and capable. This budget is another important step towards eliminating child poverty. The ongoing trajectory we have seen in recent years is encouraging, but we have much more to do. For budget 2025, the impact on weekly household disposable income is largest for lone parents. The support for all families in this budget and in the cost-of-living measures is clear from lump sum payments, child support payments, increases to working family payment thresholds and single person child carer tax credit. Through a mix of direct targeted expenditure on children in poverty and increased spending on universal services, we can provide opportunity, nurture potential and prevent stigmatisation. Through successive increases in the child support payment, we have protected low-income families, and this year we are providing the largest single increase in this crucial payment. Following the successful introduction of the hot school meal programme by the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, we will now target holiday hunger, ensuring children most at need have access to a full meal every day regardless of whether it is in the school year.",
                "We are increasing funding to Tusla to support our foster carers, expand our network of family resource centres and provide more residential care placements. I will continue to work closely with the child poverty and well-being programme office in my Department and with colleagues across government to break down silos and devise new ways to combat child poverty.",
                "A key element of overall expenditure in 2025 was early agreement and certainty on the level of health funding. This was an important decision we took as a Government earlier this year. It has resulted in another record year of investment for our health service. Through this agreement, an additional €1.5 billion in funding was provided for the health service this year, along with a further €1.2 billion in ELS for next year. The benefits of these successive increases in funding for health are clear - lower healthcare costs, the introduction of new services, reductions in waiting times, which we are not seeing in many other countries, but we are seeing in Ireland, and fewer patients waiting on trolleys. It has underpinned increases in capacity, with record levels of recruitment meaning thousands more nurses, midwives, health and social care professionals and doctors now working in our health service. It is providing for new hospital, community and critical care beds right across our country.",
                "We live in a country with one of the highest life expectancies in the European Union and we are seeing improving survival rates for so many common diseases. This does not happen by accident. This is as a result of sustained levels of investments in healthcare. To preserve these benefits and provide for an ageing and growing population, next year, we are once again providing record funding to the Department of Health for more than 3,300 healthcare professionals, new drugs and medicines and more training places for our nurses and doctors. We will increase capacity both in our hospitals and close to home by providing more acute and community beds, expanding emergency departments in five hospitals, funding six more injury units and extending GP hours.",
                "When I was Minister for health, I was particularly proud to establish the women’s health task force. I commend the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, for his commitment to delivering on the action plan that flowed from that. In budget 2025, he and the Government have built further on our work in this area with the provision of free HRT and the expansion of the free IVF scheme.",
                "Another area in which we must do more to break down barriers is disability. We can never have this national pass-the-parcel approach when it comes to solving intractable problems. This applies to disability, migration, child poverty and so many other areas.",
                "Regarding disability, we need everyone to pull together. Last week in the House, Deputy Fitzmaurice provided an example that outlined the challenges of the occasionally siloed approach to disability services. I am pleased to see real progress in the area of disability, with a significant increase in the budget this year of 11.6% to expand services. Over the lifetime of this Government, an additional €1.2 billion has been provided for specialist community-based disability services. I am particularly pleased that, next year, we will fund key roles and trainee placements in our children's disability network teams, continue the assessment of need waiting list initiative and support our new autism strategy. There is money to hire significantly more SNAs and special education teachers, enabling children with additional needs to reach their potential in our schools. I welcome the reform work that is happening in the Department of Education to ensure that we move beyond the annual challenge of a parent trying to find an appropriate school place for a child with a disability.",
                "Budgets are not just about today. They are, of course, about tomorrow and, indeed, about planning for our economy and society years from now. We know that, in addition to pent-up housing demand, we have major infrastructural deficits in our country, from water and energy to rail, roads, hospitals and schools. We know we cannot spend the windfall surpluses that our economy produced this year on current expenditure, as doing so would be inflationary. We also know that any windfall has to be invested in a sensible way so as to get the best value from it.",
                "The budget has outlined a series of principles that will govern the allocation of historic surpluses. They all point in the same direction, that being, a prudent approach to meeting the needs of our country. Our society’s progress demands it, and the Government will use the funds from Apple and other surpluses to supply it. From the surpluses generated, we will invest to create a new Ireland that responds to the needs of our citizens with a strategic focus on four pillars: water, electricity, transport and housing. By investing surpluses in these areas, we will future-proof our country, enable people to live the lives they wish to and, once and for all, meet our key infrastructural needs.",
                "I wish to acknowledge that, when we gather here on budget day, many of the Deputies opposite make considered contributions worthy of consideration. We should always be open to other ideas and willing to listen to alternative points of view. However, it is without doubt that there are some Deputies who view budget day merely as an opportunity to outdo one another with performative outrage. Some parties are particularly guilty of this. The reality is that this Government has produced a budget that delivers for the country. Others have produced plans that would wreck the economy with 22 separate tax cuts, an attack on our FDI sector and more taxes on working families and that never mention how they would keep the economy growing and creating jobs, just a discussion about how to spend the surpluses that would not be in place had they been in government. They would not safeguard the future by putting money away in long-term funds like the Government has done and they commit to spending everything that comes in, never saying from where the extra money will come. In contrast, the Government is matching helping people and giving working families a break with protecting our economy and making sure not to increase inflation. We are investing in two long-term funds to ensure we are saving for the future and preparing for a greener future. We are being prudent with windfall receipts, focusing on improving our public infrastructure.",
                "I do not believe that any Irish Government has ever delivered a final budget with such a large surplus and the economy in such good shape. We are using that growing economy, which has more jobs than ever before, to build a more secure future for people and our country. For this reason, I commend our budget."

                "This is a budget for a modern country determined to protect its success and use its resources to permanently tackle key issues. It is a balanced, fair and progressive budget that significantly expands vital public services and supports. It is a budget that protects and promotes the economic success that generates the resources on which these public services and supports rely. Critically, it is a budget that shows urgency and ambition in further accelerating investment in home building, critical infrastructure, environmental sustainability and regional development. This budget is based on a belief in the core strengths of our country and a clear determination to deliver further progress.",
                "Over the course of five budgets, we have implemented a consistent approach to helping families and businesses with vital supports and direct assistance through what has been by any measure a tumultuous period. I accept that we have provided more direct aid for families and expanded services more than the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council recommended. However, it is our assessment that urgent needs and our rising population require this additional funding. We do this within reasonable boundaries, especially given the overall size of the economy. We have also acted to create reserve funds that will help to maintain services during a major downturn and ensure the delivery of economically essential investment programmes.",
                "Even then, we have come nowhere near meeting the always escalating demands of Opposition parties. For them, the economic and fiscal background to the budget is irrelevant. I am satisfied that we have struck a reasonable balance between addressing urgent needs, investing in the future and protecting against a downturn. In this, we have a record of substantial achievement on which to build.",
                "We have heard an extraordinary level of nonsense so far concerning the money we are receiving as a result of the European Court of Justice’s ruling on past tax arrangements with Apple. We were entirely correct in demonstrating that we would behave in a transparent and trustworthy way in defending our tax agreements and arrangements, and because we did so, we have protected revenues that are worth many times more than relate to this one case.",
                "It has become increasingly clear that most of the Opposition has no interest in the policies that deliver jobs for workers and revenue for public services. The self-proclaimed parties of the workers are nothing of the sort. Our anti-worker, anti-climate action, anti-trade and anti-reserve fund Opposition is the least progressive to be found anywhere in Europe. When delivering lectures here demanding that windfall revenue be spent more rapidly, the Opposition should perhaps take a moment to remember that it angrily attacked every policy that generated that revenue in the first place. We have chosen a responsible and far-sighted approach to handling revenue that is either one-off or uncertain over the long term. Our overwhelming approach is to invest in our country’s future and increase the productive capacity and sustainability of our economy so that we can deliver pensions and public services well into the future. There is no doubt that a refusal to spend everything now carries with it political risks. Even with significant increases in spending, we have not pleased everyone. However, it is the right thing to do. It learns from the past experiences of Ireland and many other countries and shows our seriousness about maintaining a strong economy and high employment.",
                "One of the last things that the Opposition likes to talk about when discussing the budget is the economy, but the facts show our record in helping to steer Ireland’s success through dramatic challenges. During the past four and a half years, we helped our country through a series of economic shocks of historic proportions. We managed the aftermath of Brexit, involving the departure of our largest trading partner from the Single Market to which we belong. We managed to protect lives and livelihoods threatened by the fastest moving recession ever recorded in peacetime and the immediate closure of much of the economy as a result of the pandemic. We managed to help families and the economy as a whole through a worldwide series of simultaneous supply chain, energy price and cost-of-living disruptions of a scale not seen for eight decades as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In spite of these shocks, we have ensured that we today have record levels of employment, record levels of investment in public services, record levels of direct aid for families and investment funds that will protect this progress.",
                "On the day this Government was formed in 2020 and I was honoured to be elected as Taoiseach, we promised to restore our country, and we did. Today, there are 593,000 more people in work, there are 115,000 more homes, wages are again growing faster than prices and our financial situation is strong enough to fund dramatic investments in overcoming real problems in housing and other areas. A coalition government is, by definition, made up of parties with different priorities. We cannot and should not be expected to agree on everything. During the negotiation of the programme for Government, we stressed our belief in investment in public services and support for pensioners and our eagerness to take responsibility for some of the toughest challenges. Each party had a deep impact on the programme, and every day since my party’s members ratified the programme in the largest internal vote ever held by an Irish political party, we have worked in good faith to respect our colleagues and their distinct positions.",

None of the undeniable economic progress achieved in recent years has been acknowledged by any member of the Opposition because, fundamentally, they are incapable of acknowledging any positives in our country. They are so dedicated to a model of total opposition that they brush aside inconvenient facts. They put politics first in everything. If you cannot acknowledge what has been achieved, how can you protect it? How can you build on it? It is, unfortunately, the sad reality of so much political debate in the last few years that the Opposition has been reduced to a cynical and relentless serious of attacks-----"

                "I take the Deputy's interruptions as a compliment on the quality of my speech.",
                "In response to a balanced, ambitious and progressive budget, we have heard an incoherent barrage of attacks and no meaningful debate. The Opposition would like nothing better than to claim that they are facing some form of neo-Thatcherite Government. Of course, the reality is that we have been consistently progressive. The biggest income boost of the measures in our cost-of-living package and the more permanent budget package goes to the poorest sections of our society. Everyone benefits but the biggest benefit goes to those who need it the most. All one has to do is avail of the ESRI SWITCH model to demonstrate that. Next year, fully 24% of all income taxes will be paid by the top 1% of earners. European Union figures show that Ireland has one of the most redistributive tax and welfare systems. It also shows that inequality has fallen since 2019. The relevant coefficient is subject to minor annual fluctuations but, overall, it has fallen by nearly 4% because of this Government. In this year's budget, the increase in disposable income for the poorest families will be four times that of the highest income bracket.",
                "It also has to be said that many of the pre-budget proposals from the Opposition would be deeply regressive in their impact and would permanently narrow the tax base at a time of uncertainty. The fact that we are the only country in the world where the far left wants to abolish all property taxes shows just how cynical their approach is.",
                "Fundamentally, we have to strike a balance which is fair to all sections of society. We must help those in need but, equally, we cannot penalise the very people we need to create employment and opportunities for us all.",
                "This budget again demonstrated our commitment to helping families during a sustained cost-of-living crisis which has hit across much of the world. Energy prices remain artificially elevated due to a combination of Russia's imperialistic aggression against Ukraine and the flawed operation of elements of the international energy market. An exceptional situation requires exceptional measures. The energy credits which we are providing will help families and businesses when energy use is at its highest in the middle of winter. Increases in pensions and all social protection schemes will underpin an increased disposable income for those who are most in need of help. At the same time, every taxpayer will see important improvements in take-home pay.",
                "This budget allocates huge increases for people on social protection and in the overall social protection budget. This investment will deliver better outcomes in tackling poverty for children. It will also meet the demographic pressures, particularly in terms of the payments to dependant children, and also in terms of domiciliary care allowance with the €20 increase which is a very significant increase and a worthy one, and a well-deserved one in the face of the cost pressures that a family with children of additional needs have to face. The various once-off payments, in terms of the €2 billion that we have provided, will support households and families, in particular, to respond to the cost of living. It will help, in particular, those on lower incomes to a higher degree. That cost-of-living package, even on its own, supports the lower income deciles 1 and 2 more than the rest.",
                "At the core of this budget, however, is a sustained investment in securing our country's future. The roughly €15 billion to be spent in the public capital programme will address both the urgent needs of today and strengthen the foundations on which we can ensure prosperity well into the future. There is no argument but that we need to substantially invest in utilities and in infrastructure, in the energy grid, in road and rail and public transport infrastructure, in housing and, above all, in water infrastructure.",
                "It is absolutely right that we focus on waste when it appears, when projects cost amounts which cannot be justified by the outcome. The fact that the Comptroller and Auditor General systematically reviews public capital spending is a great strength of our system and that is why we have the Committee of Public Accounts and the Comptroller and Auditor General, but however much certain projects develop problems, the overwhelming evidence is that capital investment is delivering for the Irish people. There are many roads that have come in on time and on budget, for example, the N4 - Castlebaldwin, the N59 - Moycullen bypass and the Dunkettle interchange. I attended the opening of the Dunkettle interchange. That was a major engineering feat. It has delivered. It has been very effective in terms of that particular junction and road and it has opened up now new opportunities for housing, etc. Many schools have been built and many members of the Opposition have been at those schools. I never heard any Opposition Deputy object when a school was being opened that it somehow cost too much or was excessive. They were all there for the photographs but the more important serious point is the completion of schools, such as Scoil Mhuire gan Smál in Blarney, a new post-primary school with accommodation for 1,000 pupils including four new classrooms for special education needs students completed in three phases with a total investment of €31 million and delivered; Limerick Educate Together Secondary School, Castletroy, 1,000 pupils, post-primary, four classrooms for children with special educational needs, completed in December 2023 at €35.5 million; and St. Conleth's primary and St. Mary's infants school, Newbridge, County Kildare, 18 new classrooms, four classrooms for children with special educational needs, completed in phases between January 2023 and June 2024, an investment of €23 million.",
                "The HSE has now delivered 174 primary care centres that are currently in operation. I can recall my own health strategy putting primary care at the centre nearly 20 years ago. Those primary care facilities now are across the length and breadth of the country and the majority have been delivered on time and on budget. Examples include Ballincollig in Cork, Fermoy, Cobh, Killashandra in Cavan, Bettystown in Meath, Clondalkin in Dublin and Arklow - all high-quality projects delivered on time. Twelve hundred hospital beds have been delivered, on time and on budget, in extensions and new builds in hospitals across the country. St. Luke's in Kilkenny and the Rock Wing in the Mater are some examples.",
                "I have gone through the road budget. I say all of this to make the point that, yes, the bike shed should never have happened in my view. The Comptroller and Auditor General is correct to call out where there is excessive expenditure but we must also make the point that an extensive range of projects across a range of public services have come on stream and are delivering far better services and quality as a result of the investment. Our investments in water, in economic infrastructure, in health, in schools and in every area of capital investment show a sustained commitment to securing our country's prosperity and progress, not only today but, indeed, in the years ahead.",
                "Housing remains, and will be, for many years one of the most important challenges we face. Our rising population as well as unmet demand mean we have to continue to do everything we possibly can to increase the supply of homes for people to buy or rent. We have to build more houses as fast as we possibly can. However, there is equally no other area of public policy, which requires as sustained and diverse a programme of action as house building. More than 115,000 homes have been built so far during our mandate. We have succeeded in step changing house building from 20,000 per year to almost 40,000. We now have to push hard to build on this momentum. We need to get 60,000 homes per annum to deal with the challenge we have, but that capacity has to be built and grown. Our radical overhaul of unreasonable delays in the planning process will soon complete its passage and we can begin to enact its provisions. Hopefully we will be able to act faster in the face of the sort of systemic blocking of projects we have so often seen from Sinn Féin politicians as they work hard to try to delay urgently needed homes. We are acting to train more workers to build the homes, to free up more land to make essential utilities available and, of course, we are providing funding to help people who want to buy a home of their own. Having introduced the first ever scheme to assist people with the cost of rent, we are now building further on it. Among many absurd attacks from Sinn Féin in the past 24 hours has been the claim that we are giving up on housing. The fact shows that we are actually accelerating action on housing. It is true that Sinn Féin talks a lot about housing, but when looking more closely at the emperor's new housing policy, we find there is nothing there. It is collection of invented figures-----"

                "Of course, we do not need to look in the crystal ball when it comes to Sinn Féin's housing policy. All we have to do is look at its abject failing on housing in Northern Ireland where there is no action, no increase in home building and no expansion in social or affordable housing. Next year, we will see new records on home building in critical sectors in this country, and a further acceleration of the progress delivered by the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and this Government. There is a long way to go, but progress is clear.",
                "We believe in the importance of public services. We believe in the essential role of government in ensuring the public has access to high-quality public services, which deliver clear outcomes for them. The challenge of expanding access and quality in health remains and we are again demonstrating our commitment to a public health service that is there when people need it and that helps people to live longer, healthier lives. My party eagerly took up the challenge of leading the Department of Health when we entered government, and the facts show a deep and lasting programme of investment and development in our health services since then.",
                "It is absolutely correct that people point out where there are failings and problems in the health system. It is equally wrong to refuse to acknowledge the progress we are seeing. There has been an unprecedented expansion in the number of health professionals delivering care. Waiting lists are falling. New primary care centres are serving people throughout the country. As with all major staffing expansions in complex areas, the impact of these staff will continue to increase rapidly. With almost 1,200 extra acute hospital beds available and a rapid advance of services into new specialisms, we are seeing an historic expansion in our public health services. A revolution in specialist health services for women will be a lasting legacy of our work and I pay tribute to the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, for the significant progress he has made with regard to women's health over the past number of years. Next year we will see that again with the availability of free hormone replacement therapy, which will make this often vital treatment available to women irrespective of income. There are also the extra resources for IVF and other services. Perhaps more than anything else, led by the Minister, we have enacted a sustained series of initiatives to reduce the cost of accessing healthcare. Up to 60% of the population is now eligible for GP care. Inpatient charges have been abolished. The cost of drugs and many other charges have been reduced. This progress will continue next year. Many of the new posts and services will develop to their full potential and other new posts and services will be created. The absence of anything even close to a health policy from the Opposition is seen by the attempt to claim that a record health budget, with record numbers of health professionals and record numbers of patients being treated is something to be attacked. Our programme of investment, development and reform in health will continue.",
                "For me and my party, education has always been a passion and a priority. This has continued during this Government. Today there are more than 7,000 extra teachers in our schools than on the day Deputy Foley became Minister for Education. Some 1,300 major school building projects have been funded while 1,300 new special classes and seven new special schools have been opened. An additional 1,600 special needs assistants will be provided next year. A programme of curricular reform has been rolled out. Because we have implemented an expansion in teaching posts, there has been pressure in filling all posts. This will be overcome as extra teachers qualify. What is most important about all of this is that it is having a direct and meaningful impact in improving educational outcomes for Irish pupils. Early school leaving is at its lowest ever level and among the best in Europe. Scores in reading, maths and science are now well above international averages. As the European Commission has pointed out, the gap in attainment between socioeconomic groups is closing. This progress did not happen by chance. It happened because of important choices we have made to invest in and reform education. Next year will be no different. Funding for all schools will increase. A further significant expansion in support for children with special needs will be implemented. Free school text books will be provided for all classes. We will also implement our plans to make schools safer spaces, focused on learning and development, with funding to pay for measures to ban access to smartphones during school time. Throughout my public life, expanding access and quality in higher education has been a deep commitment. The fact that investments we made in research two decades ago today underpin industries employing thousands show that this commitment could make a difference. This Government has continued to expand higher education and we are conscious that funding cannot just go to new initiatives. It is paramount that the core funding of higher education is increased. This is happening in this budget with €150 million, which we have agreed on an annual basis through the National Training Fund surplus. That is a major step forward and a significant investment in the future of this country, despite what has been said.",
                "Ensuring that Ireland has a strong and effective voice in European and international affairs is a core value for my party and for all members of this coalition Government. It is a foundation for our shared programme for Government. We stand with the values of democracy, human rights and co-operation. It is a great pity that many in the Opposition refuse to acknowledge how Ireland has promoted both its interests and values through its foreign policy. In this budget, we are providing for a further expansion of our diplomatic network and the promotion of our priorities. Next year will see the highest ever level of overseas development aid, focused as always in helping some of the poorest communities in the world. We will also expand funding for climate finance initiatives, helping to reinforce our international standing as a leader in this field. One of the first major initiatives I launched when this Government began was the first ever major programme of funding for North-South initiatives. The shared island initiative has been a resounding success. It is funding research essential to building understanding and reconciliation, detailing the economic, social, environmental and health realities in both jurisdictions.",
                "It is funding major infrastructure, piloting new services and, most of all, delivering the sustained and deepening dialogue which was missing for so long. The shared island initiative will be funded to push forward its work in the year ahead, delivering action where for so long all we had was speeches.",
                "The men and women who serve our country as members of Óglaigh na hÉireann deserve our thanks and respect, particularly at times like this when they are representing our country and the United Nations with such distinction and bravery and in exceptionally difficult circumstances in south Lebanon. They defended our democracy in the face of an illegitimate campaign of violence and we must never lose sight of the vital role they play in protecting us and our values. In the nearly two years since I took responsibility for the Department of Defence, I have worked to begin a new era of investment and support for Óglaigh na hÉireann. The historical deficit in many areas has been undeniable and we needed to chart a new way forward. We still have much to do, but in a short period a wide range of issues have been tackled. The budget for next year reflects this, with a 9% increase supporting a wide range of improvements for individual members of the Defence Forces and investments in capabilities. It will amount to one quarter more than the allocation in 2022. Next year we will complete the purchase of a long-needed air transport capability and we will move forward in addressing obvious weaknesses through progressing both radar and subsea systems. Vitally, the budget provides fully for major improvements aimed at increasing recruitment and retention. We are only at the start of a programme of investment, reform and development in our Defence Forces and next year marks an important step forward.",
                "A core objective of this Government, led on this matter with great determination and grit by the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has been to leave a lasting legacy in tackling urgent environmental and climate challenges. Recent news that Ireland's carbon emissions have begun to fall shows progress is possible. This has involved actions across government requiring sustained action by all Ministers. Our approach has fundamentally been to seek to assist people in reducing emissions and protecting biodiversity. When new funding has been raised, we have directed the revenue towards helping communities and industries to transition while protecting employment. It is a terrible indictment of Sinn Féin's absolute disinterest in the environment that it wants to roll back initiatives which are finally delivering progress.",
                "I profoundly reject the idea, which we too often hear in this House, that there is, or should be, a conflict between meeting essential environmental and climate objectives and having a strong farming and agrifood industry. Farmers and the agrifood industry represent our most important indigenous industry. They are world leaders in many areas and provide a social, economic and cultural foundation for rural Ireland. We can protect and grow their work while meeting environmental objectives and, what is more, we are seeing this become a reality because of work we have been progressing. The Minister, Deputy McConalogue, has worked tirelessly on behalf of farmers and the agrifood industry. This can be seen again in the budget allocation for next year, which improves direct supports while also introducing and expanding a wide range of schemes that will help the sector to innovate and to prosper.",
                "The budget proposed by the Government is fair. It is ambitious, protects our economy and provides for our future. It is balanced and progressive. It will help families under pressure, expand essential public services and deliver the largest investment programme in our history. I commend it to the House."

                "I begin by recognising the huge work done by the Ministers, Deputies Donohoe and Chambers, and their teams over the last months in delivering budget 2025, the fifth and final budget of this Government. The delivery of this final budget gives us a moment to reflect. When the Green Party contested the election in 2020, we did so proposing a manifesto entitled Towards 2030: A decade of change. We went to the electorate with a commitment to act because of an unavoidable truth, namely, that we had just a decade to make the necessary changes to halt the warming of our planet and save our natural world. That manifesto sought to implement radical changes to restore the natural world and, at the same time, improve our daily quality of life. Through implementing the programme for Government over the past four years, many of those commitments are now a reality.",
                "When we entered Government in 2020, we did so determined to get to work on those necessary changes. We are changing our economy, moving away from imported fossil fuels and embracing the use of new home-grown affordable wind and solar power. We are changing how we move around, investing in major public transport upgrades, making public transport more affordable and more available and putting buses and bikes on our city streets and public transport on our rural roads. We are changing our built environment, delivering huge investments in the retrofit of private homes and our public buildings. These changes are working. In July this year, the Environmental Protection Agency confirmed a reduction of 6.8% in our carbon emissions in 2023. Ireland has proved that we can break the link between economic growth and ever-rising emissions. This is a huge change, one that many said could not be achieved.",
                "It is not just about making the necessary big changes, however. As I said, the Green Party has sought to do this in a way that is fair and improves everybody's quality of life. This twin delivery has been our guiding mission in government, in driving down the cost of childcare for the first time; increasing paid parents leave; passing the work-life balance Act; introducing a basic income for artists; delivering energy credits; cutting transport fares; giving people more options to cycle to work, college or school; delivering two new national parks; and making sure that every single budget we have passed in the lifetime of this Government has been progressive and each one has included targeted measures for the most vulnerable. I am pleased to say that budget 2025 continues this record of delivery by the Green Party in government. This is a budget that will make a real difference for families, children and the world around them. It will allow us to support parents with everyday costs in the here and now, while also building a better life for their children as they grow up. First and foremost, we are delivering for families through increased payments to parents, cheaper public transport and investment in childcare. We have record investment across Departments held by Green Party Ministers, in energy, climate, organics and the arts. This will allow us to keep delivering practical supports when it comes to energy bills, better public transport, more childcare and a thriving arts sector. We have ensured this is a fair and progressive budget. We will invest in community services that support vulnerable and marginalised communities.",
                "The impact of this budget starts from the very moment a child is born. The Green Party is proud to have secured a special baby boost, comprising a child benefit payment of €420, which is three times the normal rate. When combined with other new budget measures such as increased maternity and paternity benefit, parents will be up to €800 better off in the first six months of their baby's life. Additionally, we have prioritised targeted increases to tackle child poverty. From 1 January 2025, the increase for a qualified child weekly rate will go up by €4 for children under 12 years of age and by €8 for children over 12 years of age. We want government to support parents and children every step of the way. That is why we are investing record amounts in childcare, we have introduced free public travel for children aged under nine, extended hot school meals to all primary schools and rolled out free books up to leaving certificate level.",
                "I know parents want their children to have every possibility and every opportunity in life. They want to know that home ownership will not be out of reach for their children. Equally, the public should know the Government is doing absolutely everything possible to boost the amount of housing that is available. That is why the Green Party pushed hard to make sure the land hoarding tax was introduced as planned. This tax ensures that speculators do not get to sit on land banks watching the value of their sites grow and instead forces them to start building houses for our young people to live in. It is the right thing to do, which is why it was a key Green Party objective and why I am pleased this budget makes it clear it will go ahead from next year.",
                "We have also agreed a big expansion of the retrofitting programme so that those in existing homes can refurbish them and enjoy warmer homes and lower fuel bills. We are also increasing the amount of money available for free retrofits for low income families. Again, these are targeted measures. We want to create the kind of thriving communities and spaces for children and families to enjoy and in which creativity can flourish. This is a budget that I am proud to say delivers on Green Party promises, supporting children and families from day one, caring for our natural environment and looking after the most vulnerable.",
                "My predecessor as leader of the Green Party has been the central driver of the changes I have spoken about. This is a record of delivery I am pleased to say is continued in budget 2025.",
                "In the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, has delivered a record €1.37 billion in investment to support families and communities and continue the push for a net-zero future. That funding will ensure that people can save money while saving the planet. The Minister secured €250 in energy credits to help keep people warmer this winter. There will be a record €469 million for retrofitting and solar PV, a significant €89 million increase on last year. The warmer homes scheme has increased to €240 million to provide totally free energy upgrades for households at risk of energy poverty. This sum represents a tenfold increase in the spend on that scheme in the first year of this Government.",
                "In transport, the Minister secured a €3.9 billion budget, which is a €480 million increase in the allocation over 2024 and a €1 billion increase over the Department’s spend in the first year of this Government. More significantly, budget 2025 will see the introduction of free transport for all children under nine years on public transport, an increase from the previous age limit of five years. This means that some 180,000 additional children will travel for free this year, which was a key priority for the Green Party in this budget and something we are pleased to have delivered. Despite the progress made, we recognise that we need to continue to improve our public transport network in every part of this country. That is why €1.6 billion will be invested in public transport services and infrastructure, in new BusConnects programmes in urban areas, in new Connecting Ireland rural buses, in new local links and in new town bus services. Through this investment, we can continue to develop high-quality, accessible public transport infrastructure that everybody can avail of.",
                "We know that in delivering for children and families, we have to deliver for all parts of the country and ensure a cleaner natural environment for the next generation. Two thirds of the land mass of Ireland is agricultural land so the measures we take on farms to improve water quality, biodiversity and soil health will all have a massive impact on the wider environment. Since the Green Party came into government in 2020, we have made huge progress in the area of organic farming. We have trebled the number of organic farmers to over 5,000 and this number will continue to grow thanks to the €67 million in funding for organic farming secured by the Minister of State, Senator Pippa Hackett, in budget 2025. We have grown from 1.6% of agricultural land being farmed organically in 2020 to 5% today, and we are on track to meet our target of 10% by 2030. The Minister of State has secured an additional €10 million for 2025 to allow us to continue that positive trajectory. For the fifth year in a row, the Green Party in government is putting funding in place to pay farmers to take measures to improve our environment and secure the long-term future of their family businesses.",
                "In budget 2025, we are also seeing the impact of the Green Party in government when it comes to protecting nature. Over the past five budgets, we have brought National Parks and Wildlife Service funding from €28 million in 2020 to €78 million today. The Minister of State, Deputy Malcolm Noonan, has transformed the National Parks and Wildlife Service with a root and branch renewal, including additional staff and the setting up of a new biodiversity officers programme. There is a lot more to do but with that significant core investment, with the €3.15 billion climate and nature fund opening soon and with the nature restoration law now firmly in place, Ireland has never been in a better position to take real action for nature.",
                "As the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, I am delighted that I am in a position to continue to deliver for children and families, in particular some of the most vulnerable people in the State. Over the last four years, I have overseen a radical reform of early learning and childcare in this country, a reform that has been backed by unprecedented levels of investment. When I became Minister, funding for early years was €638 million whereas in 2025, it will be €1.37 billion, which is more than a doubling of investment in that four-year period. This funding has helped to deliver significant reductions in childcare costs for parents. It will support increases in hours and places available in childcare, increased pay for early years professionals, who do such incredible work in services all over the country, and an increase in funding for early learning and childcare services.",
                "Core funding, which is the funding paid directly to services, will be €390 million next year, which represents an 80% increase in funding since it was first introduced in 2022. We are increasing support for Equal Start, the DEIS model for early years that I introduced last year, to ensure that high-quality early learning and care is accessible for every child, regardless of their background. Next year, as part of that programme, we will roll out hot meals for vulnerable children.",
                "Throughout my Department, we are increasing support for the most vulnerable. Budget 2025 sees an increase of almost 40% for Tusla - the Child and Family Agency, with €1.2 billion being provided in current and capital funding. We know it is vital that foster carers are supported and valued in order to keep carers in the system and maintain the high rates of foster care, relative care and other care options that we see in this country. Last year, I supported a significant increase in the foster carer’s allowance and the second allocation of that will be paid from 1 November. This year, we have introduced additional supports. First, we know that in transitioning into foster care settings, there are inevitable once-off costs that foster carers experience. In budget 2025, I have secured an allocation to provide an additional double payment of the foster carer’s allowance at the start of each placement. We have also secured over €300,000 to contribute towards the mileage costs incurred by foster carers as they bring the children they are caring for to various appointments.",
                "Also in the area of Tusla, I have always seen the importance of family resource centres and the support they provide to communities around the country. Earlier this year, I was able to provide increased funding for 53 of the network of 121 family resource centres. Given the budget announced yesterday, we will be able to grow the network of family resource centres by an additional five services next year, meaning that many new communities will be able to benefit from the range of services that family resource centres provide, from childcare all the way up to services for our elderly.",
                "For youth services, €84.9 million has been allocated for next year, which represents a €9 million increase. That additional funding will support the sustainability of youth organisations. It will also help the expanding youth work services capacity, particularly through the funding of ten new UBU targeted youth services throughout the country. Crucially, following work undertaken by the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, I am delighted to announce funding for a pilot programme aimed at tackling holiday hunger, to be delivered through youth services. This will ensure that the benefits of hot school meals do not end during the summer break for the families who rely on them.",
                "There are 650,000 people with a disability in this country. This year, we are allocating the largest sum of any budget over the last five years for disability services, some €3.2 billion, which is an increase of over €1 billion on the figure allocated since 2020. This funding will help to support people with disabilities to participate equally in society. The money will go towards improving and expanding services, increasing pay and assisting people living independently in their own homes. I believe this significant allocation reflects the priority given to disability since its transfer to my Department and it reflects the good work undertaken by the Minister of State, Deputy Anne Rabbitte, over the last four years. In 2025, we will see further expansion, including in regard to children’s services, day services, residential services and significant additional personal assistant hours, thereby supporting the independence of people with a disability.",
                "The Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, has worked tirelessly to secure record funding for sectors and communities under her Department's remit. She introduced the pioneering basic income for artists scheme and the €325 weekly payment for thousands of artists and workers in the arts is now funded beyond its three-year end date next year. Funding for arts and culture under the Minister has almost doubled since she became Minister. Next year, the Arts Council will receive €140 million in funding, Culture Ireland €8 million and Screen Ireland €40 million.",
                "In supporting the tourism sector, the Minister, Deputy Martin, has secured €126 million in funding. Following the inspiring success of our athletes over the summer, funding for sport will increase to €230 million for the next year.",
                "Funds to support specific broadcasting schemes have increased by €6 million, with the inclusion of a new scheme for news and current affairs for independent radio and television. TG4 will get €60 million in record funding and after unprecedented funding for the Gaeltacht in recent years, €6 million in additional moneys will be provided to support language schemes and Údarás na Gaeltachta.",
                "Throughout the last four years, the Minister, Deputy Martin, has ensured that the arts, sports and tourism were supported through the pandemic and the cost-of-living crisis. The funding secured in budget 2025 will sustain those key communities and industries into future years.",
                "As Green Party leader, I am proud that this budget continues the tasks we set ourselves in government of embedding the huge generational changes in our economy in how we live, investing more in helping families in their everyday lives and targeting measures at the most vulnerable. All of these steps have one thing in common. They are about taking the right action now to ensure that we all have a better tomorrow, that we drive forward with the crucial measures to protect our planet and the nature around us and, in particular, that things are better for our children when they grow up and start their own families. These have always been the Green Party's priorities and this is the work that we will continue to do."

Perhaps, after all the bragging and hot air, the Taoiseach cannot present himself to stand by and stand over his budget. I am curious to know why he is not here.",
                "This could and should have been a budget to turn the page on the persisting and ever-worsening crises in housing, health and on what is an overwhelming cost-of-living crisis for so many households; to address the biggest barriers for ordinary people fulfilling their dreams and ambitions; to make Ireland a better place to build a good future; to finally give a generation of young people the hope and the real opportunity to build a secure and prosperous life here at home; to change direction and invest with ambition in a new future where people can put an affordable roof over their heads, whether they wish to buy a home of their own, rent a home or acquire a council home that provides security; to make sure people get healthcare and treatment when they need it, see a GP when they are sick and be confident that an ambulance will arrive on time and that they will have the dignity and will not be left on a trolley in a corridor or on a waiting list for years on end; to provide childcare that does not break the bank and begin the work of building a modern, public childcare system; and to deliver real help with the cost of living to make a long-term difference when it comes to meeting the barrage of bills that land week in and week out. This is the budget Sinn Féin would have introduced yesterday.",
                "When the dust clears, the fanfare fades and the spin dies down, it is clear that the Government's budget has no horizon beyond an election campaign. It is big on short-term, once-off measures but with no answers to the big questions and big pressures in people’s lives. There is no plan, no direction ahead, even with unprecedented resources. Even in a time when money really is not an issue, the Government cannot rise to solve the obvious hardships and crises that give rise to so much pressure and despondency in our society.",
                "As the saying goes, \"You can fool some of the people some of the time but you can’t fool all the people all of the time\". The Government's budget is a three-card trick. It asks people to look over there at the big numbers, the big money, to distract them from the young couple who will continue to save and save but cannot buy a house, from the daughter who will still live in the box room of her parents’ house with her kids, from the child with scoliosis and spina bifida who will continue to wait in agony and from the low-paid worker who will still have to choose between heating or eating.",
                "The Government is spending billions. It has billions more to invest and yet it cannot name one major challenge that it is resolving. It cannot point to one big crisis it is fixing. It cannot tell us one single way it will make people’s lives better for the long term beyond the election campaign. It is all frantic energy but no substance, no new ideas and, most importantly, no results. The Government is hoping that the big numbers will hide all of that. When we cut through all of the spin, in the long run it is just more of the same. It is actually another version of the Government's budget from last year. Its public relations and soundbite machine wants people to believe that this is somehow a shiny new Government. The Government has done the taoisigh hokey cokey. We have had three different taoisigh since 2020 but this coalition has been in office for more than four years. This is its fifth budget and failure is written across each of them.",
                "Yesterday, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, described this budget as a budget of hope. Hope for whom? Is it hope for the vulture funds, big landlords or the banks? When Fine Gael talks of hope it is simply code for telling working people and ordinary communities to wait for improvements that it has no intention of ever delivering. We know this because it has shown us again and again. Fine Gael has been in government for nearly 14 years and has been joined at the hip with its friends in Fianna Fáil for the last eight of them. It has had over a decade to do things differently and finally deliver for workers and families but no. It is incapable of changing direction; it is not in its DNA. That is why budgets will come and go but nothing really changes for those who need change the most.",
                "This budget is directionless, lazy, copy-and-paste politics from the Government's tired old playbook. It is the recycling of the same failed policies and broken perspective. The money and resources are there and the excuses are gone but the political will from the Government to deal with the big challenges of the day is absent. Let us just call it like it is. Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil are the problem. There was a housing crisis before this budget and there will be a crisis after it. Our hospitals were overcrowded before this budget and they will be overcrowded after it. Parents needing affordable childcare before this budget will still need affordable childcare after it. By the way, a Thánaiste, and to the Taoiseach in absentia, there was a cost-of-living crisis before this budget and when all the one-off money has been spent, there will be a cost-of-living crisis after it. Sinn Féin proposed a cost-of-living package to bring the very necessary and immediate relief that people need in the here and now and beyond the vista of an election. The Government failed to grasp this. Its energy credit will be cancelled out by extra charges. The benefit of its rent credit will be erased by further rent hikes that it has refused to stop.",
                "In his speech to the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis in April, the Taoiseach said “We have to fix housing once and for all.” He plucked a figure out of thin air just to grab headlines. Another soundbite that followed was Micheál Martin’s claim that the Government would fix housing. This followed Leo Varadkar’s promise to make housing his main priority. That was three taoisigh, with three empty promises and promises broken.",
                "I wonder if the Taoiseach noticed the housing crisis before coming to office. Did the Government not notice it while sitting at the Cabinet table for eight years? It is clearly banking on those in housing need who need a home of their own - the ripped-off renters, the generation left behind - having some form of amnesia and on their memories being faulty.",
                "This budget is no different from what has gone before. The Government has ignored the call of its own Housing Commission for a radical reset in housing. Let us break down the Government's offering. There is no additional funding beyond what it has already committed, no increase in its inadequate targets and not one extra social or affordable home. It beggars belief. The Government has no intention of cracking housing affordability for working people.",
                "Instead the Government has chosen to double down on policies and turbocharge schemes that hang a price tag of €500,000 on its so-called affordable homes. What planet is the Government living on?",
                "What of renters who have been hammered by rent hike after rent hike? On the Government's watch people are paying on average more than €6,000 extra a year in rent. The Government offers a renters' credit but again, it refuses to stop rent increases. For this measure to have an impact one must do both things but the Government is not prepared to do that. What does this mean? It means that in reality, this is a €1,000 bonus for landlords, for greedy vulture funds, and for wealthy property funds, not for hard-pressed renters looking for relief. Some have described this as a giveaway budget but this is the budget in which the Government officially gives up on housing and has thrown in the towel. The budget is a recipe to ensure that house prices will continue to go up beyond the reach of working people. Extortionate rent will continue to go up and the number of people, including children, cast into the nightmare of homelessness will go up. There will be more children growing up in bed and breakfast accommodation and hotels and more children robbed of the childhood they deserve. The consequences of the housing crisis belong to Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael and they need to own that fact. It is a crisis that has sent young nurses, teachers and gardaí to Perth, Toronto and Boston in search of the opportunities denied to them at home by the Government's bad decisions. This is a defining disgrace of the Government. Our young people are denied the opportunity to build futures at home, or to return home to their country to live and contribute here. It is a shameful state of affairs in a time of plenty. It is utterly unacceptable to us.",
                "Sinn Féin has the plan to bring the housing crisis to an end. We will make housing affordable, bring homeownership back into reach for working people, and build 300,000 homes in five years, a figure arrived at by listening to the experts, including the Government's own Housing Commission. The Government should try that some time. In our budget, we set out how we could deliver 21,000 social and affordable homes next year, put a month's rent back into people's pockets, and stop rent increases for three years. There are no half measures here gentlemen but real solutions. The Sinn Féin plan, A Home of Your Own, will transform housing in Ireland and will give back the hope of a generation that has been stolen by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. We will be ready to start delivering it from day one. That is real energy because it is backed up with a real plan and real action.",
                "The Taoiseach has said that he remembers the names and faces of children with scoliosis and spina bifida who were left for years waiting in agony for life-changing surgery. I wonder whether the Taoiseach and his colleagues remembered their names and faces when they sat down to write this budget. It compounds the damage that has been caused by making and breaking a promise to these children when Simon Harris was Minister for Health back in 2017. Seven years on and that promise still has not been kept. This budget ensures that these children will continue to wait in pain and continue to deteriorate and some of them will run out of time. That is the heartbreaking fact.",
                "As their parents listened on to the budget, they also must listen to all Government Members deny, distance, and evade responsibility for the national children's hospital debacle. The Taoiseach was the Minister for Health who greenlit this project and the contract with the developer. He promised back in 2019 that the hospital would be finished. A former Taoiseach also went so far as to say it would happen unless a meteorite struck, but I put it to an Cathaoirleach Gníomhach that there was no meteorite and there is no hospital. Here we are now in 2024 and nobody in government can tell us when the hospital will open much less what the final costs will be. That reality and that truth does not fit neatly into a soundbite or the narrative of spin that now surrounds this Government.",
                "Last year this Government left a €3 billion hole in the health budget with disastrous consequences. The recruitment embargo has to top that list. This was an incredibly reckless Government decision when our health system is crying out for staff needed to deliver the care people need. Again this time around there is no clarity or transparency on the funding of the health service. The Government talks of hope but there is very little in this budget to give people hope when it comes to healthcare. There is very little to expand capacity in our hospitals and increase the number of beds to the levels required in community or in mental health. We have heard story after story of older people in particular and the very ill left on hospital trolleys. They will find it very hard to find any hope in this budget. The Government has provided only €120 million for new current expenditure. This is paltry when we consider the scale of the challenge.",
                "The Government has given enough just for things to stand still and it tries to present catch-up money as new investment. It is not. People will see through this because people will be hit hardest with the consequences of this decision. Where is the vision and where are the measures to tackle crisis waiting lists, to reduce the costs of healthcare and medicines in a meaningful way, and to invest in community and local services? It is not in the Government's budget but the Tánaiste will find that vision in Sinn Féin's budget proposal for 2025 where we propose an ambitious additional investment of €672 million for current expenditure and €312 million for capital expenditure. That is €860 million more than the Government offers, and every bit of it is needed. Our proposal would provide 150,000 extra medical cards for working families, reduce the cost of medicines for all families, bring in a price reduction for the drug payment scheme to have it kick in at €50 rather than €80, and we would phase out prescription charges over three years. Our proposals would allow us to begin the work of delivering 5,000 hospital beds and 2,000 community beds by 2031. These are the plans that set the bedrock of the road to universal healthcare that is free at the point of care in the next decade. To address the scandalous waiting list and to repair our mental health services that are on their knees this is what is needed but the Government does not get it and never will.",
                "Parents and families cry out for affordable childcare. Many spend the equivalent of a second mortgage on fees. The Taoiseach raised expectations that the Government would do something impactful in the budget to bring down those high costs but this budget dashes those expectations. Again, clearly the Taoiseach was more interested in grabbing headlines than in actually doing the work to deliver the change, improvements and relief that parents badly need. There is nothing new to make childcare affordable. There is nothing to build capacity and to deliver the increase in childcare spaces so badly needed. Critically, there is no clear commitment to increase the pay of early years educators and childcare professionals to a fairer level. This is a real betrayal of the parents of Ireland."

Our plan would deliver the change they need, not just soundbites. It is a plan to make childcare affordable at €10 a day per child by next September, a plan to deliver early years educators and childcare professionals the pay increase for which they have been campaigning for years, a plan to build capacity, increase childcare spaces across the country, and extend leave to 52 weeks for parents to care for their babies in the first year. These are important steps on the road to public provision.",

                "Two weeks ago, the Taoiseach hit out at a Sinn Féin plan to invest €1 billion of the Apple tax money into working-class communities, those who really took the pain when Fianna Fáil destroyed the economy and bore the brunt of Fine Gael's cruel austerity measures. He said that we should not be dividing Ireland. It says everything about his mentality that levelling the playing field for those communities left behind is somehow divisive. Tellingly, he displays no such concern when it comes to tax changes, dividing Ireland into winners and losers, skewed to benefit those at the top the most. Take the income tax package, for example. This will mean that somebody on €150,000 will get €959 of a break, but a worker on €40,000 will only get €369. I want to know where the fairness is in that. \"More for those who have more\" is a real Fine Gael mantra. There was a better and fairer way to give people a break on their take-home pay. USC was brought in by Fianna Fáil following its disastrous crash. It was supposed to be a temporary, emergency measure but the last decade has been spent hardwiring it into the tax system. Our proposal is to abolish the USC for the first €45,000 of income for every worker. This would mean that average workers would not pay any USC at all. It would put €604 back into the pockets of those earning €40,000. That would have been fair. That is the approach that should have been taken.",
                "Another year, another budget, and this lot just could not resist giving a tax break to landlords again, with €800 this time. This is more than is being given to most workers. Contrast this with the Government's failure to deliver a decent increase to the minimum wage. We would have delivered an increase of €1.10 per hour. Low-paid workers have been thrown under the bus once again.",
                "What of the banks that have made a massive profit on the backs of mortgage holders paying big hikes in interest rates? The Government did not lay a glove on them. There was no increase in the banking levy, not one red cent extra. Sinn Féin would have increased it by €400 million, to ensure the banks pay their fair share. The Government has made it very clear, if anybody needed reminding, whose side Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil are on, and it is certainly not the side of workers and families. The parties never have been and they never will. Some 230,000 children in this State are living with deprivation, up again on the watch of this Government. Despite all the blather, this budget will not change that reality. So much for the Government's aim of making Ireland the best country in Europe to be a child. People now look at these soundbites, and in the wake of this budget wonder where is the follow-through and the seriousness in any of this.",
                "Why do carers have to wait until next July to get the benefit of the means' test threshold increase? It is not right that carers are again pushed to the back of the queue. Sinn Féin would have increased the income thresholds to €730 for a single person and €1,460 for a couple, in contrast to the Government proposal, which falls very short of that. Our measure would have seen almost 4,000 additional carers becoming eligible for carers' allowance. It would also have meant that 6,590 people currently on a reduced payment due to means testing would have become eligible for the full payment. In government, Sinn Féin would abolish the means test for carers' allowance. Our budget would also have introduced a pay related carers' benefit for those who have to give up work to care for someone. This would ensure that a carer would not see his or her income fall off a cliff edge and would see his or her income protected. People with disabilities have the right to live their lives as equal citizens, with access to work, education, services, and independent living. We know that people with disabilities are at a much higher risk of poverty, yet one would not guess that from the budget We proposed a €20 weekly increase in disability payments instead of the €12 decided on by Government. This difference would have been very significant. People with disabilities deserve far more from this Government. I want to use this opportunity to again call on the Government to ratify the UN optional protocol on the rights of people with disabilities.",
                "The Government's failure to address these big issues and more, begs the question - who on Earth would trust this Government of serial wasters with the billions in the public purse? The Government is great at spending and wasting other people’s money. The waste exposed on its watch has been breathtaking. Examples include: the most expensive hospital in the world that is €1.5 billion over budget; the most expensive bike shed in the world at €336,000 and the most expensive security hut in the world at €1.4 million. The Government used €10 million of the public’s money to stop us from receiving €14 billion in Apple tax and of course modular housing costing more than €400,000, that is, more than homes built of bricks. The Government's incompetence is off the wall and its members are incapable of taking responsibility.",
                "Maybe the reason Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil will not tackle housing, health and childcare is not only because they have the wrong policies. Maybe it is also because they simply cannot and are just not able. The Government has the financial firepower and the resources now. That will not always be the case, so we need a Government that will use money and resources wisely, plan and invest in the future with real purpose. This has to mean an end to waste and delay, the culture of mañana, the go-slow, the never-never. People regularly ask themselves why do basic things not work here? How is it that services, infrastructure and efficiencies taken for granted in other countries always seem to be an ask too far here? Things like affordable housing, affordable rent and childcare, healthcare when you need it, public transport and properly funded classrooms, that is, the staples of a decent standard of living and society, always seem too far away in Ireland. It is too much, too far for Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, in government after government.",
                "The Government is responsible not only for the housing crisis, for eye-watering rents and childcare costs, but also for the system and culture that has enabled these crises. There is an inertia that sees members of Government sit back as commentators and spinners, as these crises have damaged and hurt people. The anaemic, half-baked provisions of the budget reflect once again that they simply should not be in government. There is no way that €25 billion of the people’s money should be put into the Government's hands. It has shown again and again that it cannot be trusted to make the right choices and competent decisions.",

A general election is coming and the sooner, the better.",

It is clear that Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil now believe they are cruising back into the doors of Government Buildings and waltzing back to power hand in hand. They believe they will have it all their own way again because, in the end, they truly believe that government belongs to them and that they have some special right to power. The ordinary people of Ireland might have something to say about that. The Government wants to believe that those of us who believe in real change are on the back foot and that those of us who are determined to make Ireland a better, fairer and united country are on the ropes. It can believe that if it wants. If we enter this election as the underdogs, so be it. We have no fear of that because there is now clear blue water and a clear choice. Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have the backs of vulture funds, rack-renting corporate landlords, financial speculators and all of those at the top. We have the backs of ordinary workers, families and communities, those who have waited too long for a government that is on their side. People now have a decision to make. Workers and families cannot afford another five years of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael running the show. It is time for a new government with the right priorities and the determination to roll up its sleeves, get the work done, make improvements, invest in the future and make a lasting difference to people's lives. Sinn Féin will deliver a government for working people. I call on the Taoiseach to call the election and let the people have their say."

They are at the sharp edge of our housing disaster. It is not just that we do not have enough homes. We have overwhelmed health services, a lack of childcare places, creaking public transport infrastructure and stalled capital investment, along with rising household bills.",
                "All of this results from a Government that is content to rely on laissez-faire policies and to hope for the best. That is why budget 2025 is so disappointing. This was a budget where the Government had the capacity to be transformational, to quote the Minister, Deputy Chambers's speech yesterday. It should have been a budget that delivered real sustainable change. It should have been a budget that stepped up with the necessary public investment to address the challenges this country faces. Instead, we saw what might be described as a glitter ball budget, a budget that was all glitter and full of shiny gimmicks, once-off payments, many of which will coincidentally fall to be paid in October and November. There was no goal, however. There is no real substance there that will make a difference for people in the longer term. That is not just an Opposition party speaking. I am looking at the headlines and commentary on the budget, which describes it as short-sighted, gimmicky and a pre-election giveaway and as lacking in vision. It is full of shiny tokens. My colleague, Deputy Nash, described it yesterday as a gravy plate budget, that is, all sauce and no substance, and I believe he is right. The Taoiseach has said that he makes no apologies for this budget but I really think he ought to because it represents a squandered chance and a wasted opportunity. That is the real tragedy. The Government has contrived to waste a boom.",
                "This budget should have been the chance to focus on eradicating child poverty, giving all families and children hope for a better future, rewarding work and changing the dial on housing. That could have been done. We could have seen the serious investment necessary to get us to a point where the State is delivering social and affordable homes. We should have seen delivery of the significant investment the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, in particular wanted to see in the just transition necessary to tackle climate change. This would have involved investing in renewables, cutting emissions and keeping homes warm. The budget could have delivered on the social contract and provided a social wage that would ensure that costs were cut for families and people who need healthcare, childcare and so much more. This budget could have been, as Deputy Duncan Smith said, a genuine workforce budget that enabled the building of capacity and increased staffing levels across our healthcare, childcare and eldercare systems. It could have increased capacity in the construction industry, allowing us to build the homes we need.",
                "Instead of the sort of sustainable investment necessary to make that transformational change, we have seen a series of once-off measures. At a time of record surpluses and yet record homelessness, that is not good enough. It is not good enough for those without a home. I refer to those facing evictions, the families I talk with every day in my own constituency. They are facing the prospect of an eviction and have no support in this budget. It is not enough for families who are struggling every month to pay household bills. It is not enough for women - it is mostly women - who cannot go back to work because they cannot find a crèche place for their newborn baby. The Minister has claimed the newborn baby boost but it has been pointed out to us by many that the double payment of child benefit will not be of much help to those who need a crèche place. It has also been pointed out that there is an anomaly affecting babies born in December, leaving them excluded from both the double child benefit payments and the newborn baby boost. Babies born in October and November will get a payment but those born in December will be excluded as a result of a strange anomaly. I hope that is reviewed and reconsidered and that the grant will be backdated. In any case, these once-off measures are not enough to deal with the absence and lack of childcare places, the lack of classrooms for children with special needs and the fact that children are still waiting for assessments or therapies. It is not enough for people waiting on buses that do not arrive or hospital appointments that keep getting postponed or cancelled.",
                "This Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil-dominated Government has squandered the opportunity to invest the money that is undoubtedly there in delivering real change. Instead, it has narrowed the tax base. It has increased one-off unsustainable spending. It has no ambition and no vision to deliver change. That is a real shame. Unlike other Opposition parties, we believe in the positive power of the State to make change. We believe that the capacity to make that transformation is and can be there. We have made great progress in this country over many years but we can and must do much better. We can and must invest public money to leverage the power of the State to build better together. That does not mean a few shiny gimmicks here and there or bribing people with their own money. It means using our resources sustainably to end marginalisation and investing in public services that we can all rely on. I refer to homes for all, reliable public transport, cleaner affordable energy and decent healthcare, childcare and eldercare.",

We put forward proposals to deliver and develop a publicly provided childcare system, to ensure the building of more social and affordable homes at the scale needed, to tackle the cost of living, to address, tackle and end child poverty, to provide new climate measures like street-by-street retrofitting and to address the recruitment crisis in public services, lifting the recruitment embargo that apparently is not a recruitment embargo for some reason. We had proposals to deliver free GP care for all children. Instead, as Deputy Duncan Smith has pointed out, we will see children ageing out of free GP care this year and next. That initiative was originally brought in by Labour. We are now going to see parents forced to spend €60 or €70 per visit to the GP for children who have had the benefit of that scheme all the way up until now. It should have been expanded. We proposed a new autism and special needs guarantee to address the chronic deficit in provision for children with such needs.",

I refer to our homeless families Bill and our renters' rights Bill. If the Government wishes to help those who are facing housing insecurity, it could pass those Bills. It is not cost that has prevented the passage of these Bills. It is ideology. It is not cost that has prevented the real and substantial addressing of homelessness. It is ideology, a lack of focus and a lack of ambition to end homelessness. That is incredible when more than 14,400 people are now in homelessness. This figure includes a devastating 4,419 children. That is a new and shameful record. Each figure represents a child forced to do homework on the floor of a hotel bedroom. The Government is continuing to miss social and affordable housing targets, which are themselves set too low.",

A recurring feature has been Fine Gael's notable absence from these panels. It appears the party has thrown in the towel on housing. Undoubtedly, there is some new money in the budget for planning and other measures, but it is not enough and it again lacks ambition or vision. We are still only funding the social and affordable housing targets set out in 2021. There has simply not been enough of an increase in the funding for the retrofitting programme we so badly need.",
                "What would we in Labour do? Our proposals focus on increasing the supply of homes, ensuring protections for renters and tackling vacancy and dereliction. This is because we know that on the spending side, increasing the supply of homes is the best way to help those victimised by our housing disaster. We have called for significant and serious investment to ensure the transformation of the Land Development Agency into a State construction company to enable the delivery of homes at scale. We have called for protections for renters, a doubling of the rent tax credit, the introduction of a rents register and deposit protection scheme, ensuring the building of 22,000 social and affordable homes annually and the establishment of a new national retrofitting fund using some of the Apple money, which would create a real retrofitting revolution.",
                "On childcare, we have put forward a radical programme for equal early years, setting out steps towards having a publicly-provided universal childcare system. Others speak about public funding, but that will not deliver the radical and sustainable change needed. For all the self-congratulation that Ministers have engaged in about childcare, only a €10 million increase has been provided to overall capital expenditure for childcare, with no reference to building or buying childcare facilities. The question about the delivery of and change in childcare is not about whether to spend money but how it is to be spent. We know the State is investing in childcare and subsidising it, but it is propping up a piecemeal system that is overly reliant on small private providers that themselves are struggling and, in some cases, are closing, with a consequent knock-on effect for families and children. These are children who deserve an equal start. We are seeing staff leaving the sector because of poor pay and conditions.",
                "What do we propose? We propose the rolling out of 6,000 additional public childcare places each year to build out to 30,000 places over five years. We have also proposed the rolling out of a new childcare in situ scheme, which is genuinely innovative, to allow for the underwriting of existing private services, where feasible and where the private provider wishes to withdraw its service. This would increase access to places without removing parental choice. We have also proposed a cap on costs for parents at €200 per child per month, as, indeed, we have proposed in our previous two alternative budgets. We also wish to tackle the pay of early years educators under the existing JLC format until we can see agreed public pay scales put in place. The Minister will be more aware than anyone that public funding for childcare in Ireland remains a fraction of what other European countries invest, but we need to move towards having a new vision for childcare based on a universal, publicly-provided model.",
                "On education, we have also set out a vision for change because we all know the importance of education. Currently, far too many children are hindered by poverty in the school system. To address child poverty, Labour would introduce a new DEIS plus model. The original DEIS model, developed by the late Niamh Bhreathnach, is a proud Labour achievement, but many principals are calling for a second, focused stream of investment to break the cycle of intergenerational poverty. We have provided for initial funding of €3 million for the creation of a DEIS plus scheme. No Minister mentioned this at all, yet it is a key structural change that could address child poverty. Indeed, it is a scandal that today in Ireland hundreds of children had no special needs facility available to them at the start of the school year or had to travel long distances to access appropriate settings. This is why we have proposed an autism guarantee, a guarantee that the State will invest in planning to ensure suitable places and supports will be available every school year for every child and not the sort of scramble we see every single year for parents.",
                "On disability supports, we proposed significant investment and it was disappointing to see only €10 million in the Government's budget for the children's disability network teams at a time when the responsible Minister predicts the waiting list will reach more than 20,000 children by the end of the year. The reality is that tens of thousands of children remain failed by this Government's policies and by this budget. Nearly 90,000 children in Ireland live in consistent poverty. This budget contains no vision on the eradication of child poverty. We have proposed constructive measures that would address and tackle child poverty and end child homelessness, thereby lifting society as a whole. We do not believe in trickle-down economics, but boost-up economics work. Our Labour budget contains practical, realistic and costed plans to address the real economic insecurity impacting people's lives and impacting far too many children. It would end the Hibernian Paradox of Ireland being a cash-rich country with poor infrastructure and services, a country, which, as Deputy Nash said, is rich but feels poor for far too many people.",
                "We know the Taoiseach is likely to call an election very soon. He should name the date now and enable real debate on the choices facing voters. This is about choices and in this budget the Government made the choice not to make the transformational change that could have been carried out. The Government made the choice not to harness the power of the State to address the structural problems of inequality and poverty that bedevil this country. We in Labour have a conviction in the capacity of the State to make transformational change. As a party of the centre left, we believe there could have been a genuinely progressive budget. The Tánaiste used the word \"progressive\". I disagree with him. This was not a progressive budget, but it could have been. Unlike some of those who describe themselves as left wing, we recognise the need to tax wealth and not work. We endorse solidarity with those in the international protection system and in Ukraine. We welcome measures in the Government's budget that do provide that solidarity, but the Government's budget lacked a coherent vision and a sustainable plan to tackle structural disadvantage and structural inequality. Our fully costed plan to provide sustainable solutions for struggling households and communities around the country is what we need now. Our plan has a vision to build better housing together, to build better healthcare together and to build a better future for our children together because in Labour we believe we can build better together and that is what this Government should have done but, shamefully, has failed to do in budget 2025."

                "Since Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael went into government with each other, it has not been clear which party's ethos has been more influential. One thing was very clear yesterday, though. We saw the return of Bertienomics. Fianna Fáil's infamous economic policy approach is once again leading the way. What could go wrong? Bertie once famously said that the boom was getting boomier and that is very much the theme of this budget. It is a giveaway on steroids, with a multitude of one-off payments timed to hit people's pockets around the time we expect voters to go to the polls. It is not very subtle, but I guess that is kind of the point. After all, what is the point in trying to buy an election if nobody notices?",
                "It is not like this has not been done before. Vote for us because we are giving you back a few euro of your own money is a tried and tested formula in this country. The major problem, not just for the coalition but for the country, is that it is a formula that has been proven to fail. We all know where eroding the tax base and relying on windfall taxes got us previously - bankrupt and with the IMF running the country. This is where the Bertie approach landed us. Seeing the standing ovation yesterday from the Government benches, it is clear the parties in government have forgotten that entirely. They are speeding ahead at full throttle to the destination of a general election and spraying cash around indiscriminately on route with a dizzying array of one-off payments. All these payments will certainly be very welcome, particularly in the run-up to Christmas, but one-off payments evaporate fast. What happens then? When prices continue to rise, when disabled people will still not be able to access essential services and owning a home will still be out of reach, what supports will be available to people? Very few because the coffers will have been drained in a matter of weeks in an attempt to buy an election. This approach to the allocation of State resources is reckless and a missed opportunity.",
                "The Social Democrats would have used resources to invest in our public services that have been starved of resources for more than a decade. We would have invested in affordable housing, universal health care, free education, quality disability services and a public model of childcare.",
                "This would reduce the cost of living and build a strong social safety net, a floor beneath which people cannot fall. Instead, two statistics tell the story of where the priorities of this Government lie. Last year, the number of children experiencing deprivation went up by 30,000 or 15%. That means the parents of 30,000 more children could not heat their home or buy them a warm coat. Shamefully, despite all of the money sloshing around this Government, one in five children in the country is now in that position. Meanwhile, the total amount of State resources allocated to energy credits for holiday homes is now approaching €100 million. Why are we giving nearly €100 million to the owners of holiday homes rather than children living in poverty? Can anyone on the Government benches answer that question? This Government talks a good game when it comes to tackling child poverty. The former Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, even set up a child poverty unit in his Department, vowing to eradicate it but as so often happens with this Government, the rhetoric did not match the reality and that commitment now lies in tatters.",
                "When looking at this budget and examines the detail a common thread quickly emerges: the more you have, the more you get. That is clear from the tax package that disproportionately favours higher income earners and from the failure to target supports at those who are really struggling. Another example that, year after year, I just cannot get my head around is the €19.8 million to prop up the greyhound racing industry. Let us compare that with the €7.9 million for domestic violence initiatives. Let us consider that sum in the context of the shortage of refuge spaces in the country. Zero tolerance, is it?",
                "If the Government really wanted to use its resources to help the most vulnerable, two things are necessary, namely targeting supports where they are needed and tackling low pay. The Government has increased core weekly social welfare rates by €12. That figure appears to have been plucked out of the sky because it sounds a bit better than a tenner but what is the rationale for the increase? What index is it benchmarked against? The Social Democrats believe that welfare rates should be linked to the minimum essential standard of living and not be at the whim of the Minister of the day. To help get there, we would increase rates by €25 per week this year. This would target critical support to pensioners, disabled people, lone parents and jobseekers, the people in our society who are most at risk of poverty. We would also have increased core supports in other ways, including an additional €30 weekly cost-of-disability payment, a nearly 30% increase in financial supports to the most vulnerable children, an increase in the fuel allowance from €33 to €40 per week, an extension of the fuel allowance to those in receipt of the working family payment and an €8 increase in the living alone allowance. All of these measures could, and would, make a difference. We would also have committed to introducing a living wage in 2026 and increased the minimum wage by €1.30 to €14 per hour this year to get there. This Government has not mentioned the living wage in a while. Maybe the Minister of State can clarify if this is another commitment that now lies in tatters.",
                "I encourage everyone in this House and everyone watching to read a column by Ciara Reilly in the Irish Examiner. It is the best budget analysis they will read today. Ciara's daughter Doireann is autistic and has a significant intellectual disability. Despite this, she says her family has \"zero expectation of receiving any therapeutic help from the public system, now or in the future. Budget 2025 did nothing to change that stark reality.\". Instead, they will have to use whatever meagre financial support they get and put it towards the €5,000 annual cost of private occupational therapy for Doireann. Her family must also find money for speech and language therapy, dietician care and other therapies. Ciara describes this as \"privatisation by stealth\" and she is right. The Government has essentially waved a white flag and given up on providing these essential, critical services. There is virtually no help from the State when it comes to their provision and without them, Doireann would suffer and would not be able to reach her full potential. Can the Government see how this indiscriminate, giveaway budget is a slap in the face to these families? Let us think about the families who cannot afford to pay privately for these essential therapies. Their children go on lengthy waiting lists for an assessment of need. When they receive a diagnosis, they are finally told what supports their children need but none of them are available. The only thing they are guaranteed is a waiting list.",
                "Disability services are supposed to be another priority area for this Government but where is the evidence of that? Appointing a Cabinet subcommittee to discuss the issue is easy but where are the new measures and the additional services? When will disabled people in this country have the services that they not only need but are entitled to as a right? The Taoiseach has said that special needs services are the biggest example of where siloed politics and siloed delivery of services have let children down. Well done to him for narrating the problem but I remind him that he has been sitting at the Cabinet table for nearly a decade. He also spent four years as Minister for Health when disability services were in that portfolio. Can he tell us what, if anything, he is doing about that silo that developed on his watch? Yesterday the Minister for public expenditure, Deputy Donohoe, stood in this Chamber and spoke about the country having full employment with no acknowledgement of the fact that we have the highest rate of unemployment among disabled people in Europe. Nothing in this budget will change that. Back in April the Taoiseach promised that the Government would ratify the optional protocol of the UN Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities this year. The Government is running out of time. Will that be another broken promise or is it actually going to happen?",
                "The housing measures announced in this budget are best described as too little, too late. For years the Social Democrats have been saying that the 10% stamp duty on the bulk purchase of homes by vulture funds is too low but the Minister for housing refused to listen. Throughout all of its term, the Government remained firmly on the side of vultures. Yesterday, weeks out from an election, the Minister tried to pretend that the Government's allegiances had shifted. An increase in the stamp duty rate of 5% to 15% was announced, which is pathetic. I do not know why he even bothered. First-time buyers cannot and should not have to compete with billion dollar funds. That is why my colleague, Deputy Cian O'Callaghan, has been calling for years for a 100% tax, an effective ban, on vulture funds bulk-buying homes. If the Government had wanted to ban it, it would have done so. These half measures will not work. In fact, they are designed to fail. That was not the only disappointment. When I listened to the Minister yesterday referring to an increase in the vacancy tax, I thought that maybe finally it would act and would do something, but no. Incredibly, the Government has increased the vacancy tax from 0.5% to 0.7% of the value of a home. In all fairness, house price inflation is at nearly 10%. On what planet is a vacant homes tax of 0.7% a disincentive to sitting on an empty property or house, when prices are skyrocketing by 10%? Why even bother? It is a blatant attempt to pretend to take action on vacancy while protecting the status quo. All the while, approximately 100,000 homes are lying empty around the country and there are nearly 4,500 children living in homelessness. The vacant homes tax should be linked to house price inflation and be set at a minimum of 10%. The Government is clearly not serious about bringing vacant homes back into use.",
                "Perhaps the biggest failure in the housing budget is the continued lack of ambition. The old targets that everyone knows are far too low remain in situ. The Government is ignoring the expert reports that demand increased supply. There are some who have criticised this budget for the absence of a big idea or any vision.",
                "I am not sure I agree. I think there is one big idea, one vision, which runs through it and that is buying an election. With one-off payments galore between now and likely polling day, was there ever such a blatant and transparent attempt to try to buy votes? Where is the imagination? Where is the ambition? Where is the political courage to invest to improve this country for the better in the medium to long term? These record budget surpluses represented a unique opportunity to invest in public services to transform people's lives and the Government chose not to.",
                "Having failed to make the structural reforms that are necessary to seriously improve people's lives in the long term, having failed to target resources to lift the most vulnerable out of poverty, having failed to reach any of its social or affordable housing targets any year it was in office, having failed to improve access to critical services for children with disabilities, having failed to transform our health service and fully implement Sláintecare, having failed to reach our climate targets and having failed to improve our critical infrastructure like energy and water, the Government is now resorting to splashing the cash around indiscriminately all in an effort to distract from the fact that all the crises we face in health, housing, disability and climate will remain once these one-off payments evaporate.",
                "It goes to show that the Taoiseach can have all of the new energy in the world but without any new ideas we are simply going around in circles, repeating the mistakes that have been made in the past. All I can say is I hope people see through it."

Yesterday the Government announced an additional €3 billion for the health service, implying that this will help improve the quality of the health service. The lie involved in that was exposed this morning by health worker representatives from the INMO and SIPTU. This is something I have tried to highlight for some weeks since I got wind of it as a result of being contacted by health workers in the local St. Michael's Hospital. I initially thought it was something specific and local, but having spoken to the unions and hearing from elsewhere, I have now discovered it is a much more general deception the Government is engaged in to hide what it is doing in the health service, which gives the lie to any notion that anything in the budget represents a serious attempt to address the crisis in the health service, namely the pay and numbers strategy.",
                "During the summer the Government announced it was lifting the recruitment embargo, a recruitment embargo that it never admitted existed, but at exactly the same time it imposed that embargo by another name, the pay and numbers strategy. What that means, as explained in great detail by representatives of the nurses and midwives organisation and SIPTU this morning is that rather than the Government complying with its own commitments under the framework for nursing and midwifery and for safe staffing in our hospitals, it has set a staff ceiling on posts in our hospitals and in the health services. This, which was set in the summer, was benchmarked against whatever posts happened to be filled in September 2023 and consequently posts that were not filled in that period were suppressed; they literally disappeared. Even though the INMO cannot get accurate figures from the HSE because the HSE does not want to admit the truth about this, it estimates that about 2,000 nursing and midwifery posts have simply disappeared. They have been suppressed because those posts were filled back in 2023 and now they have disappeared.",
                "Rather than the funding allocations of the Government being based on what represents safe staffing levels in our hospitals in all areas, not just for nurses and midwives, but for doctors, caterers, porters, support staff, radiographers, physiotherapists and I could go through the list, the numbers are being based on budgetary limits and staff quotas being set on an arbitrary basis by the Department of public expenditure, leaving our hospitals chronically understaffed and critically failing to meet the requirements for patient safety, for safe staffing levels.",
                "We will have a public meeting in Dún Laoghaire tonight which I was asked to hold by staff in the local hospital. They are telling me horror stories about the unsafe staffing levels. The public health nurse whom I met at the INMO briefing last week said that 11 public health nurse posts in our area were suppressed because they were not filled as of December last year.",
                "The INMO and SIPTU both believe that this is actually linked to a deliberate agenda for privatisation. The posts are not filled or are suppressed. If that work needs to be done it is outsourced to private companies. As Phil Ní Sheaghdha from the INMO pointed out this morning, while the Government says the problem is we cannot recruit people, is it not interesting that the private agencies can recruit health staff, nurses and so on who are on inferior pay and conditions, but the HSE cannot? It is not that it cannot but that the Government will not fund the posts, is suppressing the posts and does not want to recruit the necessary staff and meet the commitments under the framework for safe staffing. They also cited the Government's failure to progress the patient safety licensing Bill which would also legally enshrine the requirement for safe staffing levels in the health service.",
                "In simple terms all that means is the crisis with scoliosis waiting lists, nearly 1 million people waiting for surgeries and 600 people on trolleys today, will continue because we simply do not have the safe levels of staffing, ratios that are necessary between nurses, midwives and other healthcare professionals and the number of patients that are being dealt with in the health service. The misery and the lack of safety for patients will continue in our health service.",
                "It is interesting that having actually done something about it and having exposed it, today, on the day we are having the public meeting because outrage is being expressed locally, I get a letter from Ireland East Hospital Group saying it is now planning to fill 21 new posts in St. Michael's Hospital which have been left unfilled, leading to chaos and demoralisation in the hospital. That shows that when workers and the community begin to get up and do something, it can force a bit of change.",
                "This is why I will be fully supporting the protests of Fórsa, the INMO and SIPTU at a number of hospitals tomorrow. I hope they continue to escalate the protests to force the Government to staff our hospitals and fund our health services properly.",
                "In the brief time available to me I will mention the housing situation. I went through this yesterday. It is absolutely shocking that with regard to the 33,000 houses a year the Government is planning to deliver year on year in Housing For All, the Housing Commission can tell us what we all knew anyway, and what the Government did not want to admit, namely, that this is less than half of what we actually need. We actually need 60,000 and more likely 70,000 houses a year and, in line with this, we need to double the amount of social and affordable housing we will deliver. Incredibly, with €13 billion from Apple, a total budget surplus of €23.7 billion and a projected surplus of €6 billion next year, the Government has not changed the planned output of social and affordable housing for next year. It is exactly the same as it was for this year, a woefully inadequate figure guaranteeing that the housing misery of those on social housing waiting lists and those looking for affordable housing will continue.",
                "When we look at the affordable housing being delivered in Shanganagh, the lowest price is €330,000 and prices range up to €390,000. We still do not know the cost of the cost rental units but a figure of €1,300 is flying around. A single income family will have no chance of securing affordable or cost rental housing. They simply could not afford it. Interestingly, the number of HAP tenancies the Government is supporting has dropped by 10,000 this year. The Government says it will expand it by another 10,000. Why did the number decrease by 10,000 last year? By and large, it is because of evictions and people being evicted into homelessness. The budget really is a sham with regard to addressing the two biggest crises facing this country, in housing and health."

These jobs are to be lost across the Pfizer sites at Ringaskiddy in County Cork, Grange Castle in west Dublin and Newbridge in County Kildare. In a statement the company said the job losses were being implemented as a last resort. I do not believe for one moment this is the case. Pfizer is a company that made profits greater than the GDP of many countries during the Covid crisis. Profits dropped somewhat after the pandemic - all things are relative - but they are now on an upward curve again. If Pfizer really wanted to avoid axing the jobs of workers who helped to make it those super profits, it could quite easily do so, but it is a ruthless capitalist moneymaking machine that will put profit before workers' interests every time. That is why, for example, Pfizer retirees have not received one single increase since 2007, with the company repeatedly refusing requests to meet with no reasons given. All I will say in conclusion on this subject is that if jobs start to be lost in significant numbers in the pharmaceutical industry, the State will have to prioritise sourcing or providing investment for new and quality employment.",
                "I had wanted to make some comments yesterday about the environment but the clock was against me so I will make them now. Transport accounts for 21.4% of Ireland's carbon emissions and emissions in the sector are rising. More than three times as many primary and secondary students travel to school by car as travel by bus. This is an area where State intervention could achieve rapid results. The investment of a mere €70 million would provide the buses to bring 50,000 extra children to school by bus. An extra €26 million would allow the service to be delivered for free. Meanwhile, €665 million would be needed to introduce free public transport. A further €337 million would provide 500 new electric buses to cater for increased demand. A significant further expenditure would be needed to hire new drivers and improve the pay and conditions of all drivers. This is the key to sorting out the recruitment and retention crisis which is manifesting in a real crisis in the Cork city bus services. Given the State surplus, the Apple tax money and the wealth being hoarded by the rich in this country, which needs to be gone after, these are expenditures that are not beyond a Government prepared to put people first over profit.",

In my city of Cork some of these problems are representing almost in miniature the problems being faced in the whole of society. Special schools are without therapists for autistic children. Water supply is often discoloured. The bus service is in a state of semi-collapse. Throughout the country, there is a massive gap between the rich and the rest. Yesterday's budget put a sticking plaster on those wounds, no more and no less than that. It fell way short of the transformational budget the people of this country need and deserve. That could and should have happened but it did not because we have a Government that is so in thrall to the rich and protecting the wealth they are hoarding and so in thrall to the capitalist market, that it will never deliver it. That is why we need a general election. It is why we need a social movement for change and a genuine left government in this country."

                "Yesterday, the Minister for Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform said education was one component in ensuring a thriving population, as is feeling supported in times of ill-health. As many Members know, I have been consistently raising questions about the planned relocation of the children's hospital in Crumlin to the national children's hospital site, bizarrely without the transfer of the genomics lab. The genomics service is vital for children with rare diseases, 30% of whom will never celebrate their fifth birthday. A diagnosis is vital for them if they are to source a treatment to prolong their far too short lives. Sadly, most of the genetic test samples taken here leave the country and go to the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Germany and Finland for genomic testing.",
                "I have raised in the House a specific concern about how the genetic information gleaned from these samples is being handled and managed. We send the genetic sample away through Crumlin hospital or St. James's Hospital. Usually we get the results back and the genetic data remains in those jurisdictions, which are outside GDPR and the proposed European health data space. We have no idea how this data is being used for secondary purposes. The only way to overcome this is to establish a centralised laboratory for genetic testing in Ireland. There is private capacity available here to ensure the tests are at least carried out here. We have an opportunity to bring all of the samples back onto the island of Ireland and control the management of those samples.",
                "On a couple of occasions when I highlighted this issue, I asked whether we had learned nothing from the cervical screening scandal. Unfortunately, I will now draw the attention of the House to one such example. Genetic tests are complex. They require specialised staff to determine the appropriate test selection, depending on the particular circumstances. In the Republic of Ireland there are numerous individual dispatch laboratories.",
                "Right across the country, different laboratories in different hospitals send their tests abroad to commercially accredited laboratories in different parts of the world without any appropriate genetic training as to determine the specialised location or what specific tests should be carried out. The dispatch from these multiple laboratories creates an increased clinical risk. A risk assessment was submitted to the HSE in 2010 identifying risks, but no action has been taken. Specialised services are centralised in the north of Ireland with appropriate controls to optimise patient safety but, sadly, that does not happen here.",
                "What is the impact of this? I will give the Minister of State the case of a family who suffered numerous antenatal losses. Their second pregnancy, a boy, died in 2020. He had a 22q11 genetic deletion identified after his passing by a particular laboratory. The parents' samples were sent to a different laboratory and the tests showed normal parental results, and the family were reassured that this was not a hereditary condition – it was just one of those things that had happened. The couple had a recurrence in 2023 in their ninth pregnancy and subsequent testing revealed that the same genetic deletion was in one of the parents, which had been missed in the first set of tests, and the young man who was born at the time was confirmed as having the 22q11 deletion syndrome. One of the parent parents told me:",
                "On a personal level, our family has experienced profound loss – nine pregnancies with only one surviving child. We know a central lab would have made a difference in our situation. Our son Oisín, born in June 2023, had medical complexities similar to those of our son Ross Junior, who ... [was born with] 22q [deletion] and passed away due to complications secondary to ... [that deletion]. Despite reassurances from medical professions throughout the pregnancy, our fear of planning another funeral was very real.",
                "[...]",
                "So many avoidable losses [in this family] stemmed from that misdiagnosis. Work missed, relationships breaking down, physical decline, weakening mental health, emotional turmoil, social isolation and spiritual disconnect.",
                "These are the consequences of not having the support of a central genomics laboratory in this country like they have north of the Border. It is impossible to summarise the devastation suffered by this family. This has consequences for the relatives who now have to go and have an analysis carried out. How can they trust the results they are going to get back when those samples are sent all over the world from different hospitals without any policy control standards whatsoever? Errors in genetic testing can take years to be recognised, as is the case in this situation, and require specialist knowledge due to the significant number of different stakeholders that are involved, leading to mistakes. The current system within the HSE poses a significant clinical risk as diagnostic stewardship is lacking centrally. Multiple hospitals are dispatching samples to multiple different foreign laboratories, some without the standards we should and would have here in Ireland. The audit trail is poor and familial sample tracing is limited. We do not even send the samples from the child along with the samples from the parents to the same laboratories. They can be on different continents where they are being tested at the moment and sadly, in this case, with a tragic and unfortunate outcome for this family, but also many more families around the country. We need a centralised genetic testing laboratory. That is urgently required in Ireland to deal with discrepancies and anomalies like the one I just outlined. It is not good enough that families are seeing their children's samples and their samples sent to different continents and laboratories, and that every laboratory in this country is sending them out of this jurisdiction without any standard protocol whatsoever when we could actually have them all processed in a single laboratory in Ireland, hopefully under the control of the State in the medium term. In the short term, however, there is a private laboratory that could carry that out. I urge the Government to deal with this as an issue of the utmost priority.",
                "We all know that yesterday was \"The Late Late Show\" budget with something for everyone in the audience and everyone in the country. The big regret I have regarding what was announced yesterday was that there was no big vision. We have a huge opportunity in terms of unlocking the potential, which is the Ardnacrusha of the sea. When this State was founded, our forefathers took a big gamble at the time and established the power station at Ardnacrusha. They did not even know what they were going to do with all the electricity at the time. In fact, the criticism in this House at the time was that all this electricity would go to waste. We have the very same opportunity today with 220 million acres of maritime resource off our coast, particularly the west coast, with 70,000 MW of offshore renewable electricity to be tapped into. However, that requires a commitment and investment from the Government. Doing that in a strategic manner can deliver a constant, cheap, clean electricity supply to every single family in this country. It can provide reliable zero-carbon electricity at a fixed price to every single business and industry in this country. We could develop data centres that can secure not only the existing investment in this country but exploit the potential of both quantum computing and artificial intelligence.",
                "I was at the United Nations at last week and at the science summit that runs alongside it. We had a presentation regarding the potential of artificial intelligence. We were told that the single biggest limiting factor and ceiling that would be created in the utilisation of artificial intelligence is the lack of basic infrastructure in terms of electricity and connectivity. Having the connectivity and electricity are vital to exploit the full potential of artificial intelligence and the emerging technology of quantum computing. We have the connectivity in this country within the island and off the island, both to North America and into continental Europe. Our big restricting factor at the moment is the issue of electricity and yet we have enough electricity off our coast not only to meet the existing needs of every single person and every single industry on this island, but to meet the needs of France and Austria as well. That is the scale of the capacity we have off our island.",
                "On top of that, we have the opportunity to create a sovereign wealth fund based on royalties that can be equivalent to those of Norway, providing certainty for our pensions into the 2200s. There is huge opportunity, but it does require significant investment and upgrading of our infrastructure, including our ports. The announcement yesterday with regard to Port of Cork is very welcome with funding coming from the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, but this funding should be coming from the investment we are setting aside to invest in technology in other countries in the world instead of investing it in our offshore renewable potential here. I proposed previously that we should establish a renewable energy development authority similar to the Industrial Development Authority, IDA, which would unlock the full potential of the opportunity off our coasts and have responsibilities ranging from research and development right through to supply chain and commercial deployment of renewable energy, ensuring that Ireland becomes the global leader in clean energy and has the ability to export that.",
                "To do that, we need to see investment in ports like Foynes on the Shannon Estuary and others elsewhere. We need to see our offshore areas, particularly off the west coast, fully mapped. A decision has been taken by the Minister, Deputy Ryan, to long-finger that mapping and instead prioritise the mapping of the south-east coast, which is to the detriment of the west coast. Significantly less mapping is required off the west coast because we are talking about floating turbines that are not fixed to the bottom. The analysis could be carried out in tandem if the Government were committed to doing so.",
                "We need to see significant grid investment. We have an indigenous company, called SuperNode, that is willing to exploit the technology it is developing to not only bring renewable electricity from the west coast onshore, but also to export it directly into the European market.",
                "To do all of this, we need to establish an offshore tsar, someone who is directly responsible to An Taoiseach and works full-time in Government Buildings to make it a reality. We only got the Maritime Area Planning Act over the line because I put pressure on at Cabinet to ensure that it fell under the direct responsibility of the Taoiseach rather than the five Departments that were dealing with it at the time. We now need to take the example of the highly successful broadband and mobile phone task force and appoint an offshore tsar who would lead all of the Government agencies and Departments and set them a clear direction and agenda. The difficulty is that there are too many Departments in charge, the result of which is that no one is in charge. We are not making this opportunity a priority. It is an opportunity that can lead to clean and cheap electricity for every home in the country and guaranteed electricity for every industry on this island."

                "The budget, despite its promises of tax cuts, increased welfare payments and infrastructural projects, continues the trend of wasteful spending. The Government has been criticised for the runaway cost of projects like the new children’s hospital, which is old at this stage, the hut outside Government Buildings, which cost €1.4 million, and a bike stand that cost €336,000. Now, €9 million has been allocated for mobile phone pouches for schoolchildren, a decision that has raised eyebrows as another example of the reckless nature of this Government’s spending. It is outrageous. For a nation that struggled to balance the books after the Celtic tiger’s collapse, this fiscal largesse feels surreal and reckless.",
                "The current budget, reminiscent of the boom-and-bust spending of the Celtic tiger era, is seen as a squandered opportunity. The Government’s failure to support the 305,000 small and medium-sized businesses, particularly in the struggling tourism and hospitality sectors, is glaring. These sectors continue to bear the burden of the highest VAT rate in Europe, leading to business closures. We have been told as much. The sectors lobbied the Government and believed it would listen, but it is not listening to anyone. It is in a bubble and does not care what it does with people’s money. These sectors also have the highest energy costs in Europe. How is that the case? They also have to deal with the minimum wage increase and the so-called auto-enrolment pension scheme, representing more expenses for people already trying to do so much paperwork.",
                "The Minister for Finance, Deputy Jack Chambers, has touted the budget’s €10.5 billion in tax and spending measures as a saviour for households and businesses. In reality, actual new spending and tax measures across 2024 and 2025 will amount to €18 billion, with multi-year commitments inflating the total to €33 billion. Imagine the trick-of-the-loop job he is doing. This spending spree is unprecedented and underpinned by volatile corporation tax receipts, creating a mirage of a surplus. Without these windfalls, Ireland’s surplus of €23.7 billion would evaporate into €6.3 billion. This could happen any day, particularly with such volatile times in the Middle East and elsewhere. We have to be very careful, yet this budget’s recklessness is unbelievable. The fiscal house of cards is vulnerable to the next global economic downturn.",
                "The budget includes some positive measures, for example, a reduction in the USC. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael promised in their manifestos at the previous two elections to abolish it, but they have not taken a euro off it. Had they abolished it, they might have put some money back into the pockets of hard-pressed low-income earners and ordinary workers, but they do not care about them. They just care about the fat cats, big business and the conglomerates.",
                "The overall approach is seen as fiscally irresponsible. The Government’s reckless spending and lack of strategic planning threaten to repeat the mistakes of the past, leaving Ireland teetering on the edge of another economic crisis. The Government has even breached its own spending limit of 5%, bringing it to 6.9%. It is reckless in the extreme to do this just to buy votes at an election, but the electorate are clever and astute. Catch me once and it is your fault, but catch me twice and it is my fault. The electorate will be waiting in the long grass for the Government because they have something to tell it.",
                "Deputy Naughten discussed the reckless energy policy. He mentioned the likes of T. K. Whitaker and other visionaries in the early decades of the State. Now, we are just wasting resources. There has been the stark revelation that €1.8 billion worth of excess wind energy has been wasted over the past seven years. This alarming figure, presented to the Department of Finance by EnergyCloud, a not-for-profit energy waste company that is not an NGO, underscores the Government’s significant strategic failure. Despite being awash with cash, the Government has failed to invest, plan and manage the national energy grid, effectively leading to colossal waste. The lights could go out at any time and the diesel generators the Government bought will not be able to keep them on. The inability of Ireland’s electricity system to accommodate surplus wind energy has resulted in electricity potentially worth hundreds of millions of euro being wasted annually. The Green Party talks about cutting our cloth and saving energy. This is shocking, especially for the Green Party. The Acting Chair is a Green, as is the Minister of State. What are they doing in government? The tail wags the dog in many respects, but the Greens do not even seem to be rubbing the dog in this case. It is abject and shocking waste. The energy paid for through capacity contracts with the State represents a missed opportunity for sustainable energy utilisation. The volume of wasted energy has surged from 276 GWh in 2017, valued at €92 million, to 1.124 TWh in 2023, worth €375 million. In the name of God and his blessed mother, what is going on? The lunatics are definitely running the asylum. No one is in charge. It is all about the Government spending and trying to buy its way out of this disaster. In the first half of 2023 alone, 506 GWh of wind energy, valued at €168 million, was dispatched due to the grid’s limitation. Since 2017, a staggering 6.261 TWh of wind energy, with a retail value of €1.84 billion, has been wasted. Mr. John Mullins, chair of EnergyCloud, emphasised in a pre-budget submission the Government’s lack of strategic planning. This not only represents a failure of energy policy, but also contributes to higher energy costs for ordinary households that are struggling. I appeal to the Minister of State. His party was meant to enact change in government and encourage everyone to go green. The Acting Chair told me that he had got rid of his cargo bike – he probably upgraded it – that he was going to give me a ride on up Monamraher on the bog.",
                "Regarding scoliosis, the Taoiseach said today that the Government was doing its best, but it is not, as the minions in government are not carrying out the work and the special money the Government gave for scoliosis went missing. Mental health services are an abysmal failure. Money is thrown at the problem but there is a lack of joined-up thinking and spaces. Look at what is going on in UHL.",
                "Then there are agencies like Tusla. On 19 September, the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, told the public accounts committee that non-compliance by Tusla in the procurement of goods and services amounted to €4.8 million, but the Government has given Tusla a healthy increase in funding in the budget despite the fact it does not run women’s refuges anymore. This NGO is totally out of control and devastating families and seems to be immune to prosecution. That is €4.8 million-----"

They have many good projects and many good staff, but there are the cases I cited there - the bike shed and the hut, and God knows how many more that we do not know about. I remember one time the former Taoiseach, Brian Cowen, being in my company and that of Dr. Martin Mansergh, then Minister of State, having a bowl of soup and a sandwich in Clonmel when the Minister of State told both of us that they were going to put an apiary in the chimney of Government Buildings - onto the helipad. The poor former Taoiseach, Mr. Cowen, nearly choked on his soup and sandwich. It did not happen, thank God, because we found out about it before it happened. God knows what it would have cost.

I was told at that meeting they would cost €200,000 to €220,000. Now I find it is a staggering €420,000, for God's sake, for cabins that could be made, I would say, for €80,000. They are not houses. One would buy a house anyway for that kind of money. The waste goes on and the OPW is in charge here. Of course, one of the biggest construction companies in the world, certainly, in Ireland, got the contract for all these ten sites all over the country. I do not know whether it was even put out to tender. I will not name the company but everyone knows who they are. It starts with an S and finishes with a K.

The VAT rate, at 13.5%, was one of the biggest mistakes the Government could ever make and it turned its back completely on small businesses. On roads funding, I would like to know where will the money go to. Where has the money gone down through the years? There is a massive lack of funds getting to the local authorities and they are begging for extra funding. In my constituency, on the N71, 37 mph is as much as I can go on most of the R586. Imagine a main road into west Cork from Bandon and Clonakilty to Skibbereen. It was 37 mph for eight or nine minutes the other day. In the name of God, lads, would you cop on? It has not worked. Passing bays is all we want, not millions of euro. It needs a common-sense spend so that people who are trying to do business can do business. If a farmer in his tractor is cutting his silage or there is a lorry or whatever, he is entitled to do his business on the slow lane. However, it is not happening. It is the same story with Ballineen to Bantry, at 25 mph to 35 mph, pulling our hair out of our heads and causing accidents. As for bypasses in south and north Bandon, will they be included in the programme this year or will they be left out again? Is it the same for the bypass in Bantry?",

There is €9 million to lock away the phones but little or nothing for these schools that are going to the local parish priest or whoever to try to get a few bob to pay the bills. It is outrageous to have €9 million for lockable phones and no money for a bus to take over 25 students from Bantry to Schull. There is no funding for a bus service in Laragh in Bandon, and no funding for life-saving improvements for Laragh school after recent roadworks where the Minister for Education says it is not her issue even though it is outside the gate of the school and the local authority says it not its issue, and children could end up being killed.",

It is outrageous. It is continuous waste. Even with dental services, we cannot even get dental services in my constituency."

The headline measures have been exposed as having little to no long-term benefit. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul's assessment is that while some of the measures are welcome, the budget lacks focus and was untargeted to those who needed it the most. Where is the action dealing with the hardships being created for disabled drivers and passengers when trying to access a primary medical certificate? Approximately 1,000 appeals were lodged in respect of this very issue. Those 1,000 appeals surely could have been upheld and that money could have been given to something like this which is so urgent and so pressing. A constituent brought it to my attention yesterday. Yet another issue has arisen that needs to be resolved, namely, that while the Government has made much of the proposals to pay two double child-benefit payments this winter and to introduce a newborn baby grant for children born after 1 January 2025, any baby born this December will be excluded as child benefit is not paid in the month that a child is born. I submitted parliamentary questions to the Minister on this first thing this morning on behalf of my constituent and I hope that the matter will be resolved. Currently, this problem means that parents will miss out on two double payments and will not be eligible for the newborn baby grant. We need it resolved, as I say.",

There were some blips. Social Justice Ireland reminds us that yet again, workers earning between €15 and €20 per hour gained least from this budget.

The effective tax rate of the highest, which is an income earner on €175,000, has decreased by approximately 0.6%. It is mostly progressive, but not entirely, and not progressive enough.",
                "I come back to the Parliamentary Budget Office review of the budget. They have done an analysis on selected social welfare rates, minimum wage and average weekly earnings for the past five years, 2021 to 2025. The minimum wage has increased by 13.3% and that is good. Most of the others have decreased. I will come back to that. What I find interesting is that it is not the State that pays the minimum wage. It is employers. Of course I support a headline increase of 13.3% in five years. We need more, but it is not the State that is paying it. It is small and medium size businesses paying, and many of those businesses are reviewing their viability because of all the extra costs of doing business. This budget has increased the cost of doing business. A lot of people think business is big business, but most of the business in this country is small business. They are in our local towns and villages, and we will see the fallout from the impact of this budget in the coming 12 months. I return again to the Parliamentary Budget Office review of the real change in average earnings and social welfare taking inflation into account. Average weekly earnings fell by 1.2% over the past five years. The review took five social welfare payments. The contributory State pension fell by 2.6% over the past five years. Non-contributory State pension fell by 1.8%. Widow's pension increased by 0.6%. Working age supports increased by 1.1%, but carer's allowance fell by 0.4% over the past five years. Those are the real figures. Despite what we hear from Ministers about the impact of this budget that is the reality of it.",
                "I also want to look at the commentary from Social Justice Ireland, which clearly states that the €12 core social welfare rate increase is totally inadequate and €25 is needed so the Government could benchmark social welfare rates to 27.5% of average weekly earnings because that was the target set by Government in 2007. We are not getting closer. It also states there has been no attempt to reduce poverty in line with the Government's own targets in the roadmap for social inclusion. Perhaps the most damning response refers to the one-off measures and double payments, which the Taoiseach said he would not apologise for and, as I said, nobody would. However, one offs are no solution to the challenge of poverty and income adequacy. Indeed, when you strip them out as they will be in the next budget or the budget after, households on fixed incomes will have been left watching in dismay as all other groups stretch their lead over the poorest and income gaps will widen further. Social Justice Ireland says a €25 increase in core social welfare rates would enable households to buy essentials routinely and not just as treats. I have asked for this at several budgets. Will the Government please look at making tax credits refundable? It makes such a difference to low-paid workers. Yesterday, I got the chance to say I was disappointed that there was no cost of disability payment. While a €400 one-off payment is welcome, the cost of disability is ongoing and cannot be tackled with a one-off payment.",
                "Finally, I searched for funding for roads infrastructure that we so badly need in the northern and western region to try to close the ever widening economic gap. The upgrading of the N17, Knock to Collooney, has to be an absolute priority. Despite my reading and rereading of the section titled road networks and road safety, there was no mention of the N17. I recognise it is just one piece in the jigsaw puzzle that will deliver balanced regional development, which only got two mentions in the entire budget - regional airports and urban regeneration. That will not cut the mustard."

                "I welcome a second opportunity to make a contribution on the budget. I also refer to the fact that we have had a chance to reflect on it. With the size of the budget and the money involved we will need a lot more time. Again, to quote Social Justice Ireland, this budget will leave a \"regressive legacy\". It welcomes the good things, as do I, but overall it points out that a couple with only one earner on €100,000 is better off by €73.35. That includes TDs like myself in the Dáil. We are all better off as a result of the budget. However, a couple with one earner on €30,000 is only better off by €3.34. Social Justice Ireland goes on to show that despite the vast resources the Government's five budgets have been cumulatively regressive. I could spend a few minutes welcoming the good things, so let me place that on the record. What is difficult for me, and I am here since 2016, which I think is eight or nine budgets, is that now more than ever we have no choice but to bring in a different type of budget framed within transformative action. I spoke about that yesterday. We are in a republic 75 years and we are not a bit embarrassed. Not alone are we not embarrassed but we believe that if we do not talk about something, it is not happening. In the two beautiful speeches of many pages yesterday, homelessness was not mentioned - 14,486 people were not mentioned in either of the speeches. That tells us a lot. To understand this budget, we need to understand what is happening on the ground. How could two senior Ministers give two speeches and not mention homelessness of the extent that it is? Again, Social Justice Ireland points out how it has increased and increased. The number of homeless people accessing emergency accommodation in August this year reached a record of 14,486. I do not think I could say that number often enough because that does not even capture hidden homelessness. Social Justice Ireland points out it sets a new high for each passing month:",
                "This marks a staggering 71 per cent increase since the introduction of Housing for All [which is really housing for some] and a 122 per cent increase since the previous strategy, Rebuilding Ireland. The Government is presiding over the worst homelessness crisis on record. The current strategy is not working.",
                "I have said on record that I appreciate the work Social Justice Ireland does. I do not agree with everything it says, but I thank it for its analysis and preparatory work before the budget. I also thank the Parliamentary Budget Office.",
                "Why am I standing here, when so many good things are in the budget? We have raised the minimum wage. We have given money to parents. We have given once-off measures to help with the cost-of-living crisis. These are all welcome. We have put money into the social sector. I know the PPNs are close to the Minister of State's heart. However, we have done that within a context that is not even outlined. Most of our energy still comes from non-renewable sources, despite efforts for onshore and offshore wind energy. There is no hope in Galway city with regard to housing. There is very little hope regarding the number of people on trolleys. I quoted the figures of 52 for yesterday - 1,000 on trolleys in one month. Surely, within a budget we would begin to look at that and analyse why that is happening. It is happening because of underinvestment for years, but also promotion of private health and private medicine, which is benefitting and making profits.",
                "Indeed, the Doughiska clinic and the one in Dublin were able to announce huge expansion plans lately. My belief, and I could be wrong, is it is because they know they can rely on public money with public patients going in there as part of our system.",

Níl an t-údarás in ann é sin a dhéanamh. Níl i gceist ach méadú beag. Ní bheidh sé in ann tithíocht a chur ar fáil nó cuí a chur ar na foirgnimh atá aige atá folamh. Ní bheidh sé in acmhainn é sin a dhéanamh agus tá gá le tuilleadh maoiniú dó.",
                "I will finish on two things that capture for me the complete lack of vision and disrespect for people. First, is the help-to-buy scheme, which has now been renewed until 2029. Every single review has said not to do this, that it is costing too much and keeping the prices too high. The last thing I will say is that I welcome the increases in children's allowance although I would have much preferred a children's allowance increase on an ongoing basis. There are three. A double payment and a payment for newborns. I find it extremely cynical that this Government would value newborns while pushing through a mother and baby redress scheme that gives no value whatsoever to children under six months who spent time in mother and baby homes. I will finish on that but I find it ironic and unacceptable. It really captures the absence of solidarity with ordinary people on the ground."

When you go to the supermarket, you might have the same groceries in your basket, but the bill is a lot higher at the checkout. This budget is about giving people a bit of extra help and putting money back in their pockets. It is the largest social protection budget package in the history of the State, with over €2.6 billion worth of measures. It focuses on supporting pensioners, carers, disabled people and working families.",
                "Older people have worked hard all their lives and they have helped to build up this country. I want to make sure they are looked after in their retirement. This budget will see double pension payments in October and December, a €200 living alone lump sum for widows and older people, a €300 lump sum on fuel allowance and, from January, a couple over 66 will be able to earn €1,048 per week and still qualify for the fuel allowance, ensuring thousands more pensioners will qualify for a payment. There will be a universal companion pass for all over-70s so they can bring their son or daughter or a friend on the bus or train with them. With my rural hat on, I know that country people do not like driving in Dublin, so I think this is going to be a very popular measure. The State pension will be increased to €289 per week from January, representing a €41 increase in weekly pensions over the lifetime of this Government.",

They are working hard, paying their mortgages and paying childcare, and I want to help them. This budget will see a double child benefit payment in November and a second double child benefit payment in December in the run-up to Christmas. I am also increasing maternity, paternity, adoptive and parent’s benefit to €289 per week, meaning these payments are now on a par with the State pension as the highest in the social protection system.",

I have been contacted in the last 24 hours, as I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has been, by many women whose babies are due to arrive in December. They are worried that their babies will arrive too late for the double child benefit payment at the start of December but too early for the newborn grant in January. As a mother, I do not want to see any woman or baby miss out. I am pleased to inform the House that babies born in December will be eligible to receive the newborn grant when their mother receives the first child benefit payment in January. Do not worry - the Christmas babies will be looked after. I thank my colleagues, in particular Deputy Alan Farrell, who raised this matter with me.",
                "The good news is that when those babies get a little bigger, they can look forward to receiving a hot dinner when they start primary school. It is one of my proudest achievements in politics to have grown the hot school meals programme from a small pilot project to universal provision in 2025, which will see every primary school child in the country receive a hot dinner in the middle of the day. The hot dinners are a great leveller. All the children sit down and eat together. There is no stigma attached to it. All the children are treated equally. Not having to think about what goes in the lunchbox every day is one less thing for busy parents to worry about when they are heading out to work in the morning. I will also be working with the Department of the Taoiseach and other stakeholders to deliver a pilot project to tackle holiday hunger over the holiday periods.",

The child support payment will replace the old IQC payment and is targeted at low-income families. I am increasing the rates to €50 per week for under-12s and €62 per week for over-12s. Annually, these payments are worth €2,600 for each child under 12 and €3,224 for each child over 12. These are targeted payments to tackle child poverty. In addition, I am increasing the income limits in order that more families can qualify for the working family payment and there will also be a €400 working family payment in November.",

Last year, I passed the legislation to ensure that long-term carers will have access to the State pension. This year's budget will see double carer's payments in October and December, a €400 carer's lump sum in November and carer's benefit will be extended to the self-employed. The carer's support grant will be increased to €2,000, its highest ever level and carer's allowance will be made a qualifying payment for fuel allowance. There had been no changes to the carer's allowance means test for over 13 years before I was appointed Minister for Social Protection. Since coming into the Department I have doubled the means test income limits from €332 for a single person and €665 for a couple in 2021 to €625 for a single person and €1,250 for a couple in 2025. This means that in 2025, a couple will be able to earn €1,250 per week and have €50,000 in savings and still qualify for the full carer's allowance payment. I know that more needs to be done on the means test and more will be done in future years if we are given the chance. When one looks at the pitiful supports provided to family carers in Northern Ireland, carers know exactly who they can trust.",
                "There is also a major package of supports for people with disabilities as part of this budget. This includes a €400 cost-of-disability grant in November, two double payments in October and December, and a €20 increase in the domiciliary care allowance to €360. There is a €12 increase in weekly disability payments. Disabled people will also benefit from other targeted supports such as the €300 fuel lump sum and the €200 living alone lump sum.",
                "Next year, 2025, will see the introduction of two generational reforms of the Irish social welfare system. The new pay-related benefits scheme will commence on 31 March 2025 and the first enrolments under the new auto-enrolment pension scheme will commence on 30 September 2025. As Minister, I have driven these two major reforms. I designed them and passed the legislation and I am delighted to announce the start dates as part of budget 2025.",
                "This week, I will sign the commencement orders to ensure that there can be no going back and this will become a reality in 2025. This is my fifth budget as Minister for Social Protection. I have learned at this stage that no matter what we do, it will not please everybody and there will always be calls to do more. We cannot do everything but we can and we should give a helping hand to those who need it most. When one looks at this budget in its totality, the lump sum payments, the weekly increases and the targeted measures, I believe this is a package that delivers for our older people, carers, people with disabilities and working families.",

It has been my mission, not just to strengthen and grow SICAP, but to grow awareness and appreciation of the programme at the highest levels in government and in Departments. I have grown the budget for SICAP by 36% over my time in office and yesterday I was happy to announce a further increase for the programme for 2025.",
                "I want to mention our volunteer centres. During my time in Government I have launched our first national volunteering policy and I have heavily invested in our volunteering infrastructure to ensure that we have a volunteer centre in every county in Ireland. Including yesterday's budget increase, I have grown the overall volunteer centre budget allocation by 44%.",
                "Our investment in volunteer centres is some of the best value for money we can get. Volunteer centres encourage and support volunteering locally by supporting and guiding individuals who wish to give their time freely but they also engage hugely with local groups and match up available skills with need.",
                "Speaking of volunteers, I want to acknowledge our public participation networks, PPNs. This is an extraordinary network of over 17,000 groups nationally. Every local authority area has its own independent PPN funded by my Department and the local PPN is absolutely key in local policy formulation and in facilitating participation and representation of communities at a local level.",
                "The PPNs are a relatively new structure and I am glad to say that during my time as Minister of State I have conducted a review of the PPNs and, in collaboration with the network, we have recently completed an implementation plan coming out of that review. The national network of PPNs is growing. We have a new path forward so I was especially glad to announce a significant increase of 15% yesterday on last year's budget allocation, leading to an increase of 36% since budget 2020.",
                "I have also had the opportunity to develop new community-based programmes. I have introduced a new community development programme that goes back to the core principles of bottom-up community-led development and I saw the amazing and impactful outcomes of that programme at an event in Athlone only last week.",
                "Earlier this year, I established a new community connection project. This project will fund 30 new community workers across the country who will have a particular role in addressing community division and misinformation on people seeking protection. It will run in parallel with a research project that will gather localised best practice in preventing and addressing division and tackling misinformation. It will work in collaboration with the community engagement team I have established in the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth.",
                "Before I finish I want to mention what I think will be an increasingly important programme going forward, beyond this Government. In 2022 I launched the empowering communities programme. Based on the Pobal HP Deprivation Index, I selected 14 of the most disadvantaged communities in the country and put community workers on the ground in these areas. The geographical areas selected are relatively small with a view to facilitating intensive community work in those areas that need it most. Since then, I have been able to expand the programme to three other locations and yesterday I was delighted to announce a €1 million expansion of the programme. I place particular emphasis on this programme because despite progress in many areas in Ireland, there are still areas around the country in towns and cities and rural areas which continue to be left behind. I believe the empowering communities programme will be central going forward to significantly increase social inclusion and social cohesion nationally."

              "paragraphs": [
                "This is a good budget for every household in the country and for every individual. As a Minister of State in the Department of Finance, it gives me great pleasure to rise to commend this budget to the House but also to speak to the conditions that have allowed us to deliver a good budget.",
                "The conditions of our economy do not happen by accident. They are not some fluke, as some people would imply. This is the product of over a decade of prudent, sensible, financial management in the face of serious issues. This was the coming out from a financial crash that devastated our economy and led to nearly 16% unemployment; the travails of Brexit; a Covid-19 pandemic the likes of which we have not seen in a century; a war in Europe the likes of which we have not seen since the Second World War; and a cost-of-living crisis that has impacted every household of every size and every business. Yet, we stand here to deliver a budget on the back of an economy that is still growing. Inflation rates are some of the lowest in the European Union and we have more people in work in the country at the moment, 2.7 million people, than the 1950 census shows we had living in the State.",
                "The earning power of Irish people at the moment is the highest it has ever been in history. It gives us an opportunity to have a record tax take, not just corporation tax but also income tax and VAT. This allows the Government to recognise some things. I hope we all agree that Members all enter this House with the same ambition. I acknowledge that we all want to do it in different ways, which is good and proper, but we all want to make people's lives that little bit easier. We want to help people. That is the core of why we sought office, I hope, and I would like to say that of all colleagues. In this budget will see a cost-of-living package to be delivered this side of Christmas that will go directly to the people who need it the most. It will also ensure that all those people in the State who pay their tax, who work hard and play by the rules get a little bit of their own money back.",
                "Equally, within the Department of Finance we are able to introduce an ambitious taxation package that recognises the fact that Ireland has the lowest rate across the European Union where someone goes into the highest tax bracket. It is right that we have increased that threshold by €2,000 to make sure that some day, we hope, we get to a threshold of €50,000 before someone pays the upper rate of income tax. We have seen a cut to USC on earnings up to €70,000. That is right. This is not introducing 22 new taxes that will stymie an economy and punish people for working hard or for trying their best in society.",
                "Beyond that we also see taxation measures being used best in the way we want to deliver housing. No one can deny that this budget is ambitious in building housing with 10,000 social homes to be built. We will see renewed figures in what we seek to deliver. Last year, we delivered more than 33,000 homes and this year it will be 40,000. In this budget there are measures on the one hand that will work to make sure individuals can build the homes and also deter such scenarios whereby 200 homes were bought by institutional buyers last year. This increase of stamp duty will equally see that the people who worked hard all their life, who bought their own family home and paid tax on it once, if not twice, can leave it to the next generation. Of course, taxation will, and should, be paid but the threshold at which taxation is paid is increased in the recognition of rising property prices and of rising contributions.",
                "There are two other points that are crucially important. I read some of the comments today from the armchair economists who said this will fuel inflation. Irish inflation has come down drastically after the really high inflation rates of the previous two years. The flash inflation rate for September has Ireland at the lowest in the European Union at 0.2%. This budget provides for the infrastructure development of the State. The sale of shares in AIB will allow us ply huge money not just into housing, but also into energy and water provision, and to make sure that our country continues to be attractive to foreign investment and continues to be able to support indigenous economic growth. This is why those infrastructure projects that are so desperately needed will get the real support and funding from this budget, never mind any discussion about any other windfall measures that will need to be spent and discussed in the first quarter of next year.",
                "Crucially, this budget responds to the need of the population and of our businesses to make sure we can continue to grow our economy. Without a growing economy any promise made in this Chamber or any commitment to impact the societal and community needs of our country is just hot air. We must have a growing economy and an ability to plan for the future. Once upon a time we had a rainy day fund and it was lambasted by many Members in this House but when it rained we needed that fund desperately, such as at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic."

Tá sé gan tuairim nua mhór agus gan phlean mór agus nach mbeidh aon rian de nó tionchar aige go fadtéarmach. Budget 2025 has shown us that this Government is out of time and out of ideas to fix the problems in our society. I have heard the Government try to take the narrative or the rhetoric of the future in terms of the budget, but the truth is that the legacy of this project will disappear like snow on a ditch. The fact is that this budget is about today and not tomorrow. When comparing the Sinn Féin budget we would have brought forward against the Government's budget, the difference is on a massive scale. The Sinn Féin budget would deliver much greater capital spending not only in housing and in health, but also, crucially, on the energy sector and on climate change on multiple scales to that proposed by the Government.",
                "There is no disputing one fact. For all the spiky responses from the Government benches, I have not heard a single contribution from the Opposition that has disputed the fact that the Government has spent a lot of money. When we have the good fortune to spend a lot of money what vision do we have, what legacy do we leave, and what are the choices we make? Those are the questions. The Government has made the choice to focus its tax cuts so that somebody on €150,000 will earn three times the kind of tax cut that somebody on €40,000 makes. The Government has made the choice to give a tax cut to landlords. As far as we can see, this cut is one that everyone in the Department of Finance has rubbished and raised concerns about. Former ESRI experts have outlined this cut as one of the stupidest tax reliefs they have ever heard of. That is said with the bar set quite high. The Government has decided to continue very favourable tax regimes for the banks and for other categories of people, and it has failed to make the necessary investments. I do not dispute that a lot of money has been spent but the Government could have properly tackled housing at long last. I agree with Deputy Eoin Ó Broin that the Government has raised the white flag. I know the Government tried to dispute this but it keeps backing policies that are not working, are making the situation worse and will not deliver the scale of social and affordable housing that is necessary.",

In the context of my own portfolio, the Government could have begun the process of, or committed to, abolishing the means test for carers' allowance. What it has done is where other people would feel the benefit of the budget, but those who do not currently qualify for carers' allowance will not see the benefit of an increase in threshold until June. Will the Minister of State, Deputy Emer Higgins, bring that forward to January?",
                "People with disabilities deserve a great deal more. We have spent a year talking about the additional costs of disability with a Green Paper and so on. To her credit, the Minister for Social Protection has withdrawn her flawed proposals but she has done nothing in this budget to recognise the additional cost of disability. The increase in the payment for people on disability should have been €20 at the very least, rather than allowing them at the base rate. Clearly there needed to be a recognition of the increased cost of disability.",
                "Sinn Féin would have increased the income threshold for carers to €730 for a single person and €1,460 for a couple, much beyond what the Government is doing and a substantial step towards abolishing the means test. We would have also introduced a pay-related carers' benefit, which the Minister should consider. She spent some time saying that people are giving out about the child benefit payment, but it is certainly not us. We had advocated a double payment. What is more, child benefit is still below where it was at in 2008 when it was cut by Fianna Fáil on the back of austerity and paying off the banks. It has not returned to that level and there has not been an increase in four or five years. We would have increased that by €10.",

It appears that the Minister for enterprise massively overestimated his capacity to influence his Cabinet colleagues because he was all over the media publicising his own down-to-the-wire negotiations pleading for the VAT reduction sought by some in the hospitality sector, but he failed to convince anyone. It looks like a back-of-an-envelope scheme, although I hesitate to even call it that, that was cobbled together at the last minute. It is another one-off payment for struggling businesses when what they need is a real and meaningful contribution that recognises that the cost of doing business for SMEs is putting them under severe pressure.",
                "The Minister's latest attempt at providing supports fell far short of what was required. While SMEs were calling for help, the Government was putting one convoluted scheme after another in place, with ever more complex ways to access funds. Massive amounts were returned to the Exchequer, not because they were not needed - they were desperately needed - but because the Government could not design a scheme that was fit for purpose. As with those schemes announced in the previous budget, we will have to wait for the detail on this one. This latest scheme of the Government will be judged on whether it is accessible for SMEs. Many will be excluded because they do not have a rateable premises or because their rates are too high. This is the case for many businesses in the Dublin area and the Government will know this because it left them out of previous schemes.",
                "What did the Government do for enterprise? It decided to pit business against workers by telling workers on the minimum wage that they will only get an increase of 80 cent per hour. In what way does this recognise that there is a cost-of-living crisis? In what way does this help the lowest earners to keep up with their bills? This is the biggest signal yet that workers will have to wait for a different government if they are ever to get the living wage. Working adults aged 20 and under are still on sub-minimum rates of pay, where they will stay until there is a new government. Instead of helping SMEs to pay their workers a living wage and ensure they have access to appropriate levels of paid sick leave, the Government tells workers that they will have to wait. It does not need to be either-or.",
                "On the other hand, Sinn Féin would have supported businesses to be able to keep up with rising costs while ensuring that workers can get the pay increases and the sick pay they need and deserve. That is why we proposed a €250 million PRSI rebate package for businesses employing workers on low incomes. We value labour and workers. This is why we proposed a decent raise in the minimum wage of €1.10 per hour, as the next step in the plan to move to the living wage. That is why we have also tabled legislation that would change the Low Pay Commission to the living wage commission. We are serious about delivering for workers, because we understand that people on low incomes need a hand up but the Government is more interested in giving its old pals, the vulture funds and the corporate landlords, another dig-out. Workers know who is on their side and so do our SMEs. We have listened and we do not buy the Government line that there has to be a choice between supporting workers or supporting business. A Government that is serious about action over spin can do both but that is not this Government.",
                "We believe in growth that supports working people but the Government is hoping that workers will be dazzled by the spin and the big numbers. I welcome the decision to release some of the money in the National Training Fund. Sinn Féin tabled legislation to enable this fund to be accessed some time ago. It is really good to see that the Government is finally catching up with us.",
                "This budget fails utterly to recognise the housing crisis or its impact on businesses. The lack of affordable accommodation for workers and families is shameful and is also a serious impediment to growth. In my constituency, the Fingal Chamber of Commerce tells us that the slow delivery of infrastructure, and specifically housing, presents a threat to Ireland's competitiveness and reputation, resulting in a direct impact on recruiting and retaining workers and worryingly, the ability to attract additional FDI. Almost 43% of businesses in Fingal said that the availability of housing rental accommodation is a serious issue. Chambers Ireland has said that the greatest challenge facing SMEs is the lack of available talent, which is driven by affordable and appropriate housing being unavailable across most of the country.",

This comes nowhere near what is required to properly support our communities in the challenges they face on a daily basis. We met PPN representatives recently in Leinster House. They outlined how seriously underfunded they are, given that they started with 5,000 groups and now have more than 22,000 groups affiliated. Their ask for all of this work on behalf of our communities was an increase in staff and core funding of €1.5 million. I do not know how the maths work out; I am sure we will see the detail as we go along. What allocation was there in the €1.6 million? Only €1 million in extra funding was allocated to the community centre investment fund. This is despite the fund being massively oversubscribed during the application process over the last couple of year. It is clear there is huge demand for the upgrading and refurbishment of existing community centres and the provision of new ones in our growing towns and villages. Sinn Féin would allocate €1 billion of the Apple tax to community, youth and sports facilities. This is the type of big investment needed in our communities across the State. Communities are facing significant challenges coming out of the savage cuts of the austerity years and a catch-up on a massive scale is required. That is what we are proposing.",
                "For example, in my constituency, we have a huge and growing population, yet we do not have one single purpose-built youth facility. Many operate from rooms in the community centres. Some rooms have to be cleared and given back to the community centre for other groups the following day, causing huge disruption. In many of our sports clubs, members are changing in containers, with no toilets or shower facilities. Clubs such as Tyrrelstown recently got a new container and lovely dressing rooms. This is brilliant news but there needs to be a medium-term plan to build a proper, purpose-built sports and youth facility for the massive, growing community in Tyrrelstown. Corduff FC will soon be celebrating 50 years in existence. Its clubhouse is a container. Let us imagine what the club could achieve with a proper, purpose-built facility. Hartstown Huntstown FC also uses containers. Plunketts GAA Club is going to spend thousands of euro renting all-weather pitches for the winter. St. Mochtas, Erin Go Bragh and Clonee are other clubs in the same situation. The list is endless and that is just west Dublin. I guarantee that every TD in the State could mention dozens of their youth and sports organisations that are without proper facilities.",
                "This will be seen as a one-off budget that seeks to buy votes but does not fundamentally challenge poverty and disadvantage. Community is at the core of tackling poverty and disadvantage. The people in those communities are doing more than their bit. All they ask is that the Government backs them with proper facilities and supports. I do not believe that this budget does that. It is a lost opportunity and I know that if I am ever honoured enough to be on the other side of the Chamber, I will do my bit and Sinn Féin will not let the people down."

                "It is the most that any Government has ever invested in housing. It is made up of more than €3.1 billion in Exchequer funding, an additional €1.25 billion to the Land Development Agency, which the party of the Members opposite would abolish, and €1.65 billion in Housing Finance Agency funding. On top of that, we have an additional €1 billion for Uisce Éireann, bringing its overall funding to €2.7 billion. As we all know, Uisce Éireann is pivotal for the future delivery of housing.",
                "In every single budget, we have built on the previous year. This is clear to see in the number of homes we are delivering. This has increased from 20,000 homes in 2020 to what we estimate to be close to 40,000 in 2024. By any fair assessment, that is serious progress although challenges undoubtedly remain. We have managed to do this despite a global pandemic and the brutal war in Ukraine and the associated challenges. Our construction sector is growing and is expected to keep growing while those in the rest of Europe are declining. More people are buying their own homes than we have seen since the mid-2000s. Some 500 first-time buyers are buying homes every single week. This upward momentum will continue and grow as a result of this Government's budget.",
                "We are investing more than €2.3 billion in affordability. A combination of Exchequer and other funding will support the initiatives we have put in place, such as the affordable housing fund, which allows our local authorities to build affordable homes for our people; the secure tenancy affordable rental scheme; the help-to-buy initiative, which puts €30,000 of the tax people paid back into their pocket to help with a deposit and which Sinn Féin would also abolish; and the first home scheme. We have seen more than 12,000 people register for the first home scheme and there have been 5,500 approvals to date. The help-to-buy scheme has been extended to the end of the decade, providing certainty and stability to home purchasers and home builders alike. Those who are saving right now should know that this Government has their back.",
                "We have allocated €2 billion for the delivery of more social homes through our local authorities and approved housing body partners, which are crucial to delivery. This is the most we have ever invested in social housing and will mean more homes for those who are the most vulnerable, that is, our elderly, those with disabilities and those without a home to call their own.",
                "We have allocated €303 million for the delivery of homeless services with a particular emphasis on ensuring that households at risk of homelessness are prevented from entering emergency accommodation and that those in emergency accommodation are supported to exit into secure tenancies as quickly as possible. This level of funding will be kept under review throughout 2025.",
                "An increased renter's tax credit for both this year and next has been announced. This is €1,000 per renter to help defray the cost of rent, which we know is too high for many. While the renter's tax credit will assist in the immediate term, our delivery of cost-rental homes through a further €390 million under the cost-rental equity loan and secure tenancy affordable rent scheme with additional funding via the LDA will ensure a continued strong pipeline of affordable rental homes, over 4,000 of which have already been approved.",
                "In just over four years since this Government came into being, we have introduced many different schemes and initiatives focused solely on delivering more social and affordable homes. Each of these schemes is delivering for our people and significantly so. One consequence of their success has been the reaction of the Members opposite. They get particularly exercised by our schemes, which they know are working. So exercised is Sinn Féin that it has gone as far as to propose scrapping, abolishing, ending and restricting most of our initiatives to take the legs out from under home buyers. Through its alternative housing plan, which I will call \"A Home You Will Never Own\", it has put on record its absolute hostility to home ownership. I am not deterred and nor is this Government. As we see real progress being made under the schemes, my focus has been on ensuring that we have the necessary funding to deliver and accelerate them, which we do. I am confident that, under budget 2025, these schemes will continue to deliver for people right across this country.",
                "I have heard a lot of faux outrage from the Members opposite about new housing targets not being revealed in the budget. I have always said that the revised targets would be published in October and we will do that. Our revised housing targets will not be plucked from the sky but will be based on evidence and on the good work carried out by the Housing Commission, the ESRI and others. We have never been found wanting as regards financial provision in our housing budget. This remains the case today."

He appeared not only deflated but at some points even defeated. He was almost like a man who did not want to be there, which was not unlike his very brief presence today in the Chamber. When we look at what happened yesterday, it is hardly surprising that the Minister was so uncomfortable. Billions of euro in additional expenditure were announced by almost all the other Ministers in their press conferences but in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage virtually nothing extra has been allocated for the delivery of social or affordable homes. The Minister can come in here and talk about €6 billion having been allocated for next year but that figure is a fiction. It is just like when the Government said that €5 billion would be spent this year. That has proved to be a fiction, and the €4 billion announced the year before that was also a fiction.",
                "Probably the best way to explain this is the fanfare about the allegedly increased funding for the Land Development Agency. In his budget press conference a year ago, the Minister said he was going to allocate an additional €6 billion of capitalisation to the Land Development Agency. He had not even discussed it, let alone agreed it, with his other Ministers. Days, weeks and then months passed by. Only at the end of December was there a Cabinet agreement that, in fact, instead of €6 billion, it would only be €1.25 billion sanctioned at the end of last year, with a further €1.25 billion to be provided this year but without any clarity on the source of funding. Yesterday's announcement of €1.25 billion in funding for the Land Development Agency is the third time this funding has been announced. It was announced last October, last December and now. It is not additional funding. It is funding for the LDA to deliver on the existing targets within the existing Government plan but with nothing additional. In fact, there is still a €3 billion black hole in the LDA's finances, creating uncertainty as to whether it will deliver on its programme out to 2028.",
                "When we look at what was announced yesterday the total extra capital spend for housing was a paltry €330 million. That is the sum total of what the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, secured in his budget negotiations. This is why there is no increase in the delivery of social and affordable homes next year in existing targets. The Minister is right in that he always said he would revise those targets at the end of October, but that is too late for 2025. This means we will not get any increase in much-needed social and affordable homes next year on existing targets. That means that house prices and rents will continue to rise and so too will homelessness. One of the few areas where there was a significant increase in funding was in homeless emergency accommodation, where an extra €61 million was announced. This was an admission by the Government that homelessness next year is going to continue to rise. I am not surprised by that.",
                "Interestingly, the €100 million extra the Government and the Minister greatly celebrated for the inflationary and controversial first homes scheme did not come to pass. It has only been increased by an extra €30 million and the targets remain as they were originally at 2,000 purchases for next year. The Minister talked about the renter's tax credit. An extra €250 will be of no use if the money goes in one pocket and out the other in the form of a rent hike by landlords. It is essentially a payment to landlords and not to tenants. Sinn Féin has always argued that unless rents are capped at the same time as increasing the tax credit, the credit will be of no real benefit to renters.",
                "On the adaptation grants, the Minister of State, Deputy Dillon, said there is an extra €25 million for them. Unfortunately, he has now left the Chamber, but that is not what the budget book says. It states there is €25 million for disability grants and €75 million for adaptation grants. That is a total of €100 million, and that is what was in the budget for this year and it is what the budget book says will be there for next year. There is no increase in the funding for the retrofitting of social homes, despite the fact that many of the people living in those homes do so in serious fuel poverty. Again, we have been given two different figures on defects. The budget book says the funding is €70 million, the same as this year, while a sum of €100 million was mentioned at the press conference yesterday. Either way, this goes nowhere close to tackling the scale of Celtic tiger-era defects and defective blocks or other materials. Looking at the budget as a whole, when it comes to housing it is a wasted opportunity. It is more of the same and means that nothing will change next year.",
                "We have set out a very clear alternative. It would have seen an extra €2.4 billion of direct capital investment in social and affordable homes next year to double output. We have also published a detailed and fully costed alternative housing plan to show how we can deliver real affordability, end long-term homelessness and increase the supply of private homes at more moderated prices for first-time buyers. What the Minister made clear yesterday and in his very brief appearance here today is that next year things will continue in the same way if this Government is in power. House prices will rise, rents will rise, homelessness will rise and people will continue to be unable to get secure and adequate affordable accommodation. That is why what we really need is a general election, a change of Government and a change of plan to start tackling this housing crisis."

What we saw yesterday was a Government in election mode. It was not a Government in an investment-in-the-future mode.

There was a missed opportunity here to do something really positive that would leave a legacy. It is a huge amount of money just to fritter away and not leave a legacy behind. While people will welcome and appreciate the few hundred euro extra in their pockets because many of them are struggling, what they got yesterday will not make a blind bit of difference to them in the long run.",
                "I will give a few examples.",
                "I am going to talk about the baby boost. It is absolutely incredible how the Government is able to spin the figures. Everywhere in the media and in every forum where a Government representative is talking we hear about a €420 baby boost. The reality is that parents were entitled to €140 so the increase is actually €280 and only approximately 60,000 parents will be able to avail of that in any given year so it is actually quite a small amount of money. The reality is that the money, while it will be welcome because the birth of a baby is a very expensive time in any family's life, will be gone in the blink of an eye and those families will then have to worry about childcare. How they are going to pay for childcare? Are they going to be able to get childcare, even if they can afford it? Are they going to be able to get flexible and age-appropriate childcare for their children? That is really where this Government has missed an opportunity. It would have been so much better, and the Social Democrats would have been absolutely delighted, had the Government announced that it was going to invest heavily in a public childcare system, something that will be strong and be there for years, a new model of childcare based on what we have in education. It would be something that parents could rely on rather than the current approach which is just to give bits and subsidies to the private sector. It is really unfortunate that the Government has not done that. The Green Party wants to see a public childcare system and apparently Fine Gael wants to see it as well. I am not sure what Fianna Fáil's position is on it, although I did hear that the Tánaiste said it was a hare-brained idea. However, at least two thirds of the coalition want to see public childcare so why did they not put it in the budget? Why did the Government not invest in it? It is something that would make a huge difference to parents. It would be transformative. The Government has a huge amount of money available to it. It should make transformative changes rather than frittering it away with payments of a few hundred euro here and there that nobody will notice or remember in six months or a year.",
                "Finally I will refer to the other aspect of my spokesperson role which is climate and the environment. The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, was talking earlier about the 6.8% reduction in emissions that we saw last year. I am going to welcome any reduction in emissions but I want to bring a dose of reality here. First, a 6.8% reduction is not sufficient and second, the reduction that we saw last year was not primarily from any Government policy. That reduction was there because we had a twelvefold increase in the electricity that we were taking from England and those emissions were not counted in our accounting system. The other primary driver was the fact that fertiliser use fell, which was welcome, but that was driven by high fertiliser prices. We need to see a much greater focus on climate but we also need to get rid of the spin. The last thing we need is the public thinking that this Government is making progress on the climate crisis. We are certainly not making the kind of progress that we need to see and it is not just me saying that, but the EPA and the Climate Change Advisory Council. It will be clear to anybody who can read any of their reports that the Government is not doing enough when it comes to climate, nature, biodiversity and our environment."

                "I am going to talk about the health budget obviously. This year's health budget is about more services and faster access for patients, more capacity and urgent reform. The total health budget for next year is a record €25.8 billion, representing an increase of nearly €3 billion on 2024. In addition to this extra €3 billion, over €900 million of one-off funding from previous years has now been agreed as recurrent funding. New measures in this budget total €335 million.",
                "This funding is very welcome and much needed to provide care to a growing and aging population, roll out new and improved services, reduce costs for patients, increase the speed of access for patients and reform and modernise our health service. We have funding to hire more than 3,500 more healthcare workers. Given that there are currently around 3,000 vacant funded posts in the HSE, this means that between now and the end of next year the HSE is now funded to hire an additional 6,500 healthcare workers. We have funding to open another 335 hospital beds and 615 community beds and to expand services for patients in many different and important areas. This includes cancer care, women’s healthcare, trauma services, dementia services, maternity care, palliative care, rare diseases, cardiovascular health, stroke services, neurology, organ donation, genetics and more.",
                "In budget 2025 one big area we are focusing on is cancer care. I have allocated an additional €33 million to cancer care which will have a full-year allocation of around €46 million. This includes €10 million for cancer medications, €2 million for post-mastectomy products, nearly €2 million for bowel screening and around €16 million for the national cancer strategy, with a full-year allocation of over €22 million. Critically, as part of that, there is a full €5.5 million in recurrent funding for all of the amazing cancer support groups we have in all of our constituencies. They have really welcomed that funding.",
                "This will be the fifth health budget in a row where we have prioritised women’s healthcare. We are investing an additional €35 million in women’s health. HRT medication will be provided free of charge from January 2025. Eligibility for free IVF will be extended to include donor-assisted IVF as well as for couples who already have one child.",
                "I am investing €30 million in new medicines coming from targeted savings within the medicines budget. Waiting times, as we know, remain too long but important progress is being made. The average outpatient waiting time has fallen from over 13 months to just over seven months in the past three years. That is nearly a 50% reduction in average waiting times and I really want to commend our healthcare workers all over Ireland. It is an extraordinary achievement. It has taken huge effort, blood, sweat and tears, long days and weekends but to have halved the waiting time in this country in just three years is remarkable and I salute them for having done it.",
                "We are investing €420 million in waiting lists next year, an increase on last year. This includes €230 million in funding to the NTPF and €190 million for the HSE to continue the work it is doing on reducing waiting times for patients. Critically, we are moving this funding from being one-off to recurrent. It was always very valuable and well used by our healthcare workers but it was uncertain. It is now recurrent so not only can they drive on, they can plan for years into the future which is very welcome. We are also opening six new surgical hubs which is going to make a difference.",
                "This is the second year in a row that the number of people on trolleys is going to fall but we know that we still have a long way to go. In this budget we are staffing six new injury units around the country and funding expansions for five emergency departments. We have been working hard to increase the services pharmacies can provide. We passed new legislation and the expert group has reported on things like prescription extensions, common conditions and so on. It is going to bring in a new era of community pharmacy in our country. To that end, I am allocating €25 million for next year, with a full-year allocation of €50 million to facilitate an agreement between my Department and the Irish Pharmacy Union. Preliminary talks have been going on for some time but we are putting €50 million on the table so that my officials and the Irish Pharmacy Union can get into formal talks now about delivering what is needed in communities.",
                "There is no doubt that we have a lot more to do to improve productivity. While we have invested and continue to invest significantly in our workforce, bed capacity and in other infrastructure, we must, as a matter of urgency, modernise how care is delivered. A lot of progress has been made over the last few years but more is required. We must have a highly productive health service. It means the maximum amount of care for patients and the best value for taxpayers.",
                "I am allocating dedicated funding to develop advanced practice for health and social care professionals. I am progressing the role of physician assistant and funding training courses for operating theatre assistants. These are two new roles that we are bringing in. Critically, I am allocating €23 million in recurrent funding for our new e-health strategy. We are going to have the patient app at the end of this year, shared care records at the end of next year and we are now building up a big team, several hundred strong, to deliver our e-health ambitions over the coming years.",
                "Waiting times, trolley numbers and costs for patients are falling but we have more to do. We are about half way through our journey to deliver the healthcare service our country deserves. This budget is another important step on that journey."

The money will enhance access to services for high-risk drug users for the prevention of drug and alcohol use among children and young people and for minimising the harms of drug use. The measures in this funding include community-based drug services to be expanded by €2 million, with three WTEs to meet increased treatment demand. In addition €1 million will provide for 24 WTEs in order that integrated community alcohol treatment services can be rolled out on a national basis. New services will be established in HSE Dublin and midlands and HSE in Dublin and south east. Existing services will be expanded to ensure full geographic coverage across all health regions. The plan is for €1.8 million to be provided for the service in 2026.

I was joined in this by the head of the HSE but, as the Minister might recall, there was serious pushback from the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for public expenditure and reform who said that we were alarmist, that we were wrong and that the health service would not need that level of additional funding, only for in the summer economic statement the Government having to come in to bail out the health service with €1.5 billion to make up for what we had warned the Minister about in recent years.",

We are playing catch-up for years of not funding existing levels of service, ELS. None of this, or very little of it, will go towards new measures. In fact, the Minister only secured €120 million in additional current expenditure beyond what was already committed for new measures. I know the Minister says he is repurposing money elsewhere from ELS and from money that goes from non-core to core and so on to allow for new measures but in reality, the current additional allocation according to the Government's own expenditure booklet is €120 million. That is a fact. That is what is in the Government's booklet, as presented on budget day.",

However, last year the Minister was not in a position to do that because he was left naked without any additional funding at all and there was very little scope for any new measures. That is the reality of how the Government chaotically funded the health service last year. It has been stop-start funding for all of these national strategies. It was the same with new money for new drugs and the Minister had to go and scramble to find money from savings elsewhere to save face.",

They are hidden waiting lists and we have to drag that information out of the Government almost on a quarterly basis because the figures are not published. Many children with disabilities cannot get access to services.

The level of surplus in the financial coffers of the State is probably unprecedented. It got even better for the Government when €13.8 billion landed on its table, even though the Government spent €10 million trying not to get it. It is a very good day for the Government.",
                "Particularly in the past three or four years, the cost of living and inflation have eroded a lot of workers' income and their standard of living. This has had a significant effect on how workers see themselves in relative terms. There are grave inequalities in terms of housing, health and income and they are systemic in society. We need political will to really challenge these systemic forces in society. We only have to look at housing, which is a key issue. It was the key issue in the previous election and it will be the key issue in this coming election, when we have 15,000 people in emergency accommodation. We have tens of thousands of people waiting on the public housing list. These are situations which I, and many people in the Opposition, do not feel the present Administration can address. It comes back to will and the political choices that people have.",
                "Tax is a reality. We all pay tax and in most cases taxes are progressive. There is one tax that many people feel very aggrieved about and this is the universal social charge. It was a temporary measure during the crisis to pay off the bad debts and the bad policies of Fianna Fáil. Why are people still paying the universal social charge? Many people find this tax odious in terms of why they continue to have to pay it.",
                "I want to speak about health inequalities. I acknowledge the statement from the Minister for Health on progress in the health service. Sometimes we have to put party politics aside when we see progress in health and that is good. There are also health inequalities that still exist to this day. A total of 50% of the population still relies on private health insurance. Why is this the case? There should be just one health service rather than a two-tier health service, which is based on income. If people have enough money in their pockets they can get the treatment they want but if you are working class on a low income you have to wait, and sometimes you have to wait for years. This is a grave inequality that has to be addressed.",
                "With regard to what Deputy Ward said about the overall budget for mental health, we still have not reached the level of having 10% of the overall budget, which the Mental Health Reform coalition states we need to reach. At present it is still 6%. It is well below where it should be. Again, this is a faultline in our health service that has to be addressed.",
                "Will we ever see this level of surplus again? Who knows. We saw large surpluses 15 or 16 years ago and then it all went south after that. This is an historic opportunity to address the grave inequalities in housing, health and incomes. Can they be addressed? Many in the Opposition do not think so. As long as Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil are in power, we will always have these systemic inequalities in our society. It comes down to choice and the forces the Government looks at. Does it look at the forces of the free market and capitalism or the forces of putting people before profit? This is why this opportunity has failed."

There is an increase of €712 million in core current funding and an increase of more than €360 million in core capital funding compared with the original national development plan allocation for 2024.

One parent recently told me they felt like they were on a hamster wheel and I really do get that. In budget 2025 I am announcing that the free book scheme will cover all students, from primary school right through to the completion of the leaving certificate examinations. This will alleviate the financial pressure on parents of 940,000 students. It is important to acknowledge and thank our school leaders and school staff for their work and commitment in implementing the free schoolbooks scheme this year and for all they do in so many ways for the young people in their care in the world of education. With regard to the schoolbooks scheme, the Department of Education will allocate an administration support grant to primary, special and post-primary schools in the 2025-26 school year, based on the size of the school, to assist with the additional work required.",
                "I know that finding special education school places can be an enormous stress for parents also. In the budget we will hire another 1,600 special needs assistants and 768 additional special educational needs teachers. This will open up 2,700 school places next year for children with additional educational needs. I acknowledge there have been delays in finding places for some children with additional educational needs this year. I welcome the fact the National Council for Special Education has confirmed to me it has 24 places available for the 16 children still in need of them and that the issues regarding the need for school places will be resolved in the coming days.",
                "Since becoming the Minister for Education more than four and a half years ago I have prioritised the summer provision programme and I am pleased to confirm the budget provides more than €65 million in permanent funding for the summer programme for children with special educational needs and students at risk of educational disadvantage. I am also pleased to confirm we have had a 20% increase in the number of schools offering the summer programme this year. This permanent funding will allow us to continue to cater for the continued growth of the summer programme.",
                "I know that mobile phones in schools are an issue of enormous concern to parents and I will provide funding to secondary schools to procure mobile phone pouches or other storage solutions in order that students get a mental break from their phones during the school day. I have heard some Deputies criticise the €9 million allocation for this scheme as a waste of money but I have made this decision based on international research, which has highlighted the negatives of having mobile phones available in the classroom and in school grounds.",
                "Last year a report by UNESCO, the UN's education agency, recommended that smartphones be banned from schools to improve learning and to tackle classroom disruption and cyberbullying. UNESCO cites evidence that removing smartphones from schools in Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom improved learning outcomes. It noted that having a mobile phone nearby with notifications coming through is enough to result in students losing their attention from the task at hand. One study found that once distracted, it takes students up to 20 minutes to refocus on what they were learning. I believe this new scheme will support positive well-being among all our pupils. It will help them to learn in their classrooms, make friends and engage with one another without the distractions that can arise from mobile phones.",

                "That is why I am increasing the State funding for primary and secondary schools, known as capitation grants, by 12%. That is in addition to the 9% increase in capitation last year. This will improve the funding that schools have available to them to cover their costs. We are also going to provide €45 million for schools from the cost-of-living package to help with their day-to-day running costs, such as heating, insurance and electricity. We are also going to ensure that our schools continue to have a supply of excellent teachers, with budget initiatives such as the new bursary for science, technology engineering and mathematics, STEM, teachers. This will provide student teachers in third or fourth year of STEM undergraduate initial training education qualifications with a €2,000 payment each year for the final two years of their programme. There is a clawback provision: any student teacher getting the payment will be required to undertake in writing to refund the payment in the event of their not completing a minimum of two years consecutive service in schools. Up to 800 student teachers are expected to be eligible for the bursary from the 2025 to 2026 academic year.",
                "I also know the importance of providing career progression for our existing teachers. That is why I am announcing that there will be 1,000 additional school posts of responsibility. We will also have free upskilling courses for staff, and funding for the new primary curriculum and senior cycle reform. We have a significant package in the budget to tackle educational disadvantage, with more education supports available for children who are at risk of leaving school early. We will also commence the roll-out of the Traveller and Roma education strategy, which I was pleased to launch recently.",
                "I am including two other significant measures in the budget to help parents with the cost of living. I am going to continue to exempt junior cycle and leaving certificate students from the usual examination fees, and I am going to keep reduced school transport scheme fees in place for families, which will remain at €50 for a primary school student, €75 for a post-primary student and €125 for a family ticket. I am also keen to progress the recommendations in the latest review of the school transport scheme, and provision has been made for that.",
                "Finally, I will draw Members' attention to the capital budget for school buildings, which is increasing by more than €360 million to €1.3 billion next year. This will allow us to progress more than 350 school building projects, which are already under way, and bring another 200 school building projects to construction. Overall, the education budget is worth almost €12 billion, which is the single highest amount ever. It will help reduce costs for parents and families as well as continue to improve our vital education system."

As Deputies are aware, ensuring that children with additional needs receive an appropriate education with the supports they require is a priority for this Government.",
                "Since being appointed to this role last April, I have visited almost 30 schools in nine counties, met with 35 different organisations representing children with additional needs and attended 14 sessions with groups representing children, their parents, teachers, special needs assistants, SNAs, school leaders and special interest groups. All these engagements have provided me with valuable insights and perspectives on the day-to-day challenges and issues within special education and the measures needed to help children reach their full potential and prosper in school.",
                "It is these insights that have framed the special education budget for 2025. The funding package I have secured totals €2.9 billion. This represents a 6% increase for 2025, or €159 million. By way of context, some 250,000 children with a special educational need are accommodated in mainstream schools with supports. Approximately 28,000 children are either in a special class or a special school.",
                "Central to providing an appropriate school place for children with special educational needs is provision of special education teachers and special needs assistants. This budget will result in an additional 768 special education teachers and 1,600 extra SNAs being employed to support children in school. This is the highest ever number of SNAs allocated. In 2025, therefore, we will have more than 23,000 in our education system. We will also have some 21,000 special education teachers employed.",
                "These additional teachers and SNAs will allow us to open another 400 special classes in both primary and post-primary for 2025, bringing the total number of special classes to over 3,700. It will also allow us to create an additional 300 places in special schools. Some 2,700 children will benefit through provision of more special classes and special school places.",
                "A number of measures are also under way to ensure that children with special educational needs receive early confirmation of a school place. I have established a task force for Dublin 15, which is an area under particular pressure. This task force will be independently chaired and will include parents, schools, my Department, the National Council For Special Education, NCSE, and other stakeholders. It has been instructed to establish demand for special classes and special school places as early as possible, using data on waiting lists and known demand. The task force, in conjunction with my Department and the NCSE, is also working to develop a common application system for primary special class places, which will avoid the need for parents to apply to a number of schools. The NCSE, which has additional resources allowing it to increase the number of special educational needs officers, SENOs, from 65 to 120, will also visit 800 schools in September and October this year to begin forward planning.",
                "I have also secured additional capital funding of €80 million, which will allow my Department to order modular accommodation and get building works under way so that classes are ready for September 2025. This Government recognises the practical challenges for schools and parents in meeting the needs of children with additional needs. To help with this, budget 2025 will see targeted investment in a number of other areas including €62 million for the summer programme, which is enormously important for the most vulnerable children in our society; the creation of a special education innovation fund to develop and pilot some of the interesting ideas that special interest groups have raised with me directly; and supports for training, increased capitation and transport grants.",
                "On my many school visits, transition from primary to post-primary school has been a key issue that is brought to my attention. Having to go from a familiar one-class setting in a primary school to multiple classes in secondary school and be part of a much larger school population, and the logistical challenge of navigating it, is far more complex. All these issues have been raised with me. To help with this, budget 2025 will see targeted investment for the first time in assisting primary schools to help manage the effective transition of children with the highest level of need into post-primary education. I am also pleased that additional supports will be provided to post-primary schools to co-ordinate provision of special education supports. I will continue to work hard to support children with additional needs and work with all stakeholders to ensure an appropriate education is provided for them."

While schools struggle to keep the lights on and pay their monthly bills, this Government chose to allocate €9 million to smartphone pouches when its own document clearly states an additional €10 million in capitation. Tell me without telling me where your priorities lie. Clearly, they are not in ensuring that schools are properly funded or no longer reliant on the voluntary contributions of hard-pressed parents. When that decision to allocate €9 million for mobile phone pouches was made, the Government chose not to fund 8,881 places on a school bus for mainstream children, 779 places on transport for children with special educational needs, 220 SNAs or 120 special education teachers.",

There is now an allocation of taxpayers' money to this scheme with no clear plan as to how it will operate aside from it being centrally controlled. Are we to expect teachers and secretaries to swipe these pouches across checkout-style mechanisms to open them while queues of students form around the corner? To say it is tone deaf is to barely scratch the surface. The Government’s budget allocation for education this year pales into insignificance compared with what the measures outlined in Sinn Féin’s budget could achieve: a 20% increase in capitation for primary and post-primary schools; more than 1,500 SETs; more than 1,850 SNAs; and something that is not even mentioned in the Government’s budget or speeches, namely, significantly increased funding for Irish-medium education."

Will it address staff shortages in physiotherapy in Kerry? There are no community physiotherapists in Kenmare and the waiting list in Killarney has increased to two years. It will not include a plan for wastewater infrastructure in places like Castlegregory, Ballyduff and Abbeydorney. Core funding for the family resource centres, which do great work around the county, has not been increased. They are devastated by this news.

There will be €150 million for Garda overtime in 2025, representing a boost of 13%. This will provide resources for high-visibility policing efforts and serious crime investigation.",
                "A priority for me is to look beyond the measures that have been taken, which is why a group that I established this year will report to me soon. It has been looking outside the box to determine what more we can do to support Templemore with new recruits.",
                "Another priority for me is to support the individual members of the Garda Síochána who serve and protect our communities with dedication and skill in what are often very difficult circumstances. There is an additional budget provision of €1.5 million for training, employee well-being, medical services and equipment to support a modern police service. A further €5 million is being allocated for public order equipment, including specialist personal public order equipment, crowd barrier controls, an expansion of the dog unit, water cannons and thousands of units of body armour.",
                "I can confirm that €9 million in additional funding is being provided for enhanced road safety measures, in particular the deployment of additional speed cameras, which will provide for improved enforcement of traffic laws, reduce speeding and, ultimately, save lives on our roads.",
                "The gross allocation for our Justice Vote is €661 million, an increase of €63 million on last year. This significant increase is to support victims and vulnerable people and to provide vital services to those who need them. Tackling domestic, sexual and gender-based violence is a priority for me as Minister for Justice in terms of providing victim-centred supports and services while ensuring that perpetrators are punished. Budget 2025 provides €70 million for this, a trebling of funding since I took office in 2020. I have increased funding specifically for Cuan, our new domestic violence agency, to €67 million, including additional resources to support the implementation of our zero-tolerance strategy. There will be funding for 80 additional refuge spaces with a view to doubling their number so that every person, family or child who needs a space can access one. The domestic violence services will also benefit from the additional funding being provided for victims of crime.",
                "My Department has continued to improve the processing of international protection applicants. On top of €50 million, €25 million will go towards end-to-end investment across our system. This will provide for a reduction in application processing times by significantly increasing staff numbers and through the greater use of technology. In 2025 alone, we will hire a further 400 staff to be deployed at every stage of the process. This builds on my work of recent years in more than doubling the number of staff, with a corresponding tripling of decisions. The quicker people get a “Yes”, the quicker they can move on with their lives. If it is a “No”, the quicker they can be removed.",
                "I will shortly announce another set of successful applicants to the community safety fund. This is funding that has been taken directly from criminals by CAB and reinvested in our communities. I am pleased that the fund will reach €4 million this year and €9.5 million next year. This funding will provide for 36 community safety partnerships nationwide and see the establishment of a national office for community safety to ensure that all of the partnerships are supported in their plans at national level.",
                "I acknowledge the work of the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, in the areas of youth justice and tackling gambling as a public health problem. Regarding the latter, he is taking a Bill in the Seanad at the moment. He has delivered a more than 160% increase in youth diversion scheme funding since we started working together. The youth justice funding of €33 million will have a significant impact on individual young people, their families and wider communities. We have also secured additional funding for the gambling regulator, with funding to more than double next year to €9 million.",
                "Regarding family justice, which is another area that has needed a lot of focus over the years, ensuring that the voices of children continue to be heard in family law proceedings is an important aspect of my family justice reforms. Some €3 million has been allocated through this budget to enable the piloting of a scheme to fund voice of child reports in family law proceedings. It will also allow for the development, implementation and evaluation of a pilot project to establish a children’s court advocate. The role of the advocate will be to support children in their journey through private family law proceedings, to ensure that their voices are heard and, above all, to ensure oversight of reports provided by any person to the court.",
                "The budget for criminal legal aid will be increased by €9 million and include an 8% increase in fees from 1 January, building on the 10% increase I secured last year. There is a commitment to ensure that we can close the gap and find an additional 8% in the year ahead.",
                "The gross allocation to the prisons Vote is €525 million. Additional funding and capacity are crucial if we are to ensure that the prison system is safe and humane and has sufficient spaces to house the most serious offenders while also focusing on rehabilitation. Funding this year will support the recruitment of up to 350 new prison officers, allowing for another 130,000 extra staff hours and the building of 155 new prison spaces by the end of this year. It will also allow us to roll out the total allocation of 1,100 spaces that I have planned for by the end of the decade.",
                "Beyond that, a separate group that I established is bringing recommendations to me this week to look at what further resources are required in the prison population. It is absolutely essential that we increase overall capacity within the Irish Prison Service to continue to boost the number of staff. The allocation of €53 million will help us to deliver just this - the 1,100 new prison spaces that I have mentioned.",
                "Finally, on the Courts Vote, the gross allocation of €195.6 million is increasing by €11 million from last year. This will allow for 50 additional staff to support the work of the expanding Judiciary. I have appointed 30 additional judges in the past two years. This supporting staff will assist them in their work while laying the ground for 20 additional judges that will be allocated across the district, circuit and high courts.",
                "The courts will also receive €2 million more to provide for the progression of the courts modernisation programme. This includes the outsourcing of jury-minders to free up tens of thousands, to be exact, 24,000, garda hours for important front-line policing work. I will continue to see what areas in which we can free up gardaí to do front-line duties.",
                "Finally, I thank again my colleagues, the Ministers, Deputies Chambers and Donohoe, for supporting these proposals and, indeed, for prioritising our overall objective, that is, to have stronger safer communities."

The first thing about this budget that people must remember is that this Government has established the Future Ireland Fund and that is where we put extra funds for the projection of future investments. We have also created the Infrastructure, Climate and Nature Fund. Combined, those two funds alone will provide substantial funding put away, not to be touched for current expenditure, to deliver major capital projects that are needed, be it for housing, for industry, for infrastructure.",
                "In addition, the €14 billion from Apple has been clarified. Rather than making a big splash announcement yesterday - some people wanted to spend that money yesterday - we have said, \"No.\" We will look at it carefully and hold it until we know the objectives can be achieved. The Government is determined, over the coming months and early in the new year, to come back to this House with an outline and a framework for investing the capital that we are receiving as a result of the Apple decision. It is not for day-to-day spending; it is for investing in our future. We will look at projects that can be delivered in a reasonable time. We will make sure we get value for money. We want to make sure it adds to existing plans and that projects will have an economic impact. When we put all those funds together, we will be looking at measures that help housing. That means we have to start with water infrastructure. There is not a county that is unaware that housing projects are being held up because of lack of water infrastructure, ESB connections to the grid and other key essential items. That is what this fund is for. It is so we can have resources in place that if there is a downturn at some stage in the future, we have this fund put aside. The first thing the Government did, which everybody seems to have missed, was make provision to put aside a lot of money that we have now but are not spending now because we need it for investment into the future."

I fought so hard for those road projects, in the first place, going back a number of years, and then they were suspended last July.

The Government is spending upward of €900,000 on telephone boxes to hide telephones in schools. It then comes along and gives out free books, which I welcome, but it took away the SNA teachers. It took away the funding from people who help people who need help but have given it to another section. Again, the way the budget has been handed out, it has not been given to all education sectors. It took from one and gave to another. Again, when you look across the board at schools across this country, there are schools pupils can cycle to and schools they cannot cycle to. They all got a bike shed grant even if pupils are not able to cycle to school in the back of beyond. They still got a grant for it and were only allowed use it for that purpose, even if there was other stuff in those schools that fund could have been used for."

                "Double child benefit payments should not just be for Christmas as the Minister referred to in her Christmas babies speech. They should be for childhood. That is why the Government should have implemented the second tier of child benefit recommended by the ESRI and many other organisations fighting for children's rights. That is why, in order to make real progress and reduce child poverty, we needed to see the increase for a qualified child go up by €6 per week for children under 12 and €15 per week for children aged 12 and over. That is why the core welfare rates increases of €12 per week fall significantly short of the €20 increase needed to restore their real value to 2020 levels. This was a shameless election budget. This was a giveaway budget by a Government that has given up trying to address the real fundamental issues facing this country. I always welcome any supports to help people make ends meet, but these once-off payments will be quickly eaten up by rising costs of living, rent, heating or health costs. The Government may as well have given the money straight to landlords and the energy companies. When the money is gone, this budget will not have moved us an inch in fixing the serious housing crisis, the crisis in our health service or across our public services. Young people will still leave in their droves as housing prices go up and people's standard of living goes down. This budget does zero to address the structural problems in this country. In its response to the budget, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions said:",
                "Budget 2025 does nothing to solve the range of structural flaws in our economic model. There is no obvious long-term vision to fix the long-standing crises in areas such as housing, childcare, or infrastructure delivery.",
                "There you go, the Government has given up.",
                "We are a wealthy country, but working-class people see none of it. There is more than enough money to address the problems we are facing if the wealth were more fairly distributed. The top 1% in Ireland owns €230 billion in wealth, whereas the bottom 50% only owns €9 billion. There is a deep need for change so ordinary people get their fair share. This budget has once again shown that Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party are the biggest block to that change. There is a huge concentration of political and economic power in the hands of very few at the top of society. The result of this is that the political system over successive Governments has placed profit at the heart of State policy at the expense of everyone else. This is why people cannot find homes, but big developers, speculators and landlords make billions off the housing crisis. It is reflected by a policy of increasing the stamp duty on investors buying ten or more houses from 10% to 15% - a miserly increase. That is why hundreds of thousands of people are living in poverty and millions more are struggling to make ends meet while the 1% has gained 70 times more wealth than the bottom 50% in the past ten years. This is a budget that will make that inequality worse. I again quote ICTU, which states:",
                "Throwing money from tax cuts into an economy at full capacity will simply raise prices and ultimately erode the gains from the tax cuts. The biggest winners from the tax changes will be the very wealthiest families benefiting from inheritance tax cuts as well as those on higher incomes that stand to benefit from all of the changes to personal taxes. The relative losers are those without wealth and workers on lower incomes.",
                "In this budget, someone earning €100,000 per year will receive more than four times back in tax as someone earning €25,000. The Minister for Finance said in the lead-up to this budget that the average worker would receive €1,000 back in tax and cost-of-living once offs. Someone in the top bracket will get a permanent tax cut far in excess of that.",
                "While the 80 cent increase in the hourly rate for the minimum wage is welcome, €13.50 is significantly less than the €14.75 per hour recommended by the living wage technical group. What workers need is collective bargaining as proposed by the EU adequate minimum wage directive, a Bill on which I introduced earlier this year supported by the trade unions. That along with expanded public health services is what will really help workers in the long run.",
                "This budget has cut inheritance tax to the tune of nearly €90 million. The most significant tax cuts will only be for the wealthiest 3% of people. This will further entrench wealth inequality, as it is passed down unearned from generation to generation. In contrast, the Government has delayed changes to sick leave and pensions for workers until mid-2025, which leaves workers worse off. It is a contrast for a Government that after five years has refused to increase social welfare or pensions in line with inflation. Once the once-off payoffs are gone, ordinary people will be left behind. We needed change in this budget. We needed to change the fact that for ordinary people this is a high-tax country with broken public services, but if people are rich, it is a low-tax country and they can afford to go private. SIPTU explained that our low-tax status is almost exclusively due to extremely low employers' social insurance contributions, PRSI, and to a lesser extent low capital taxes. Those are the extremely low employers' PRSI contributions, which the Government has left untouched in this budget, and the capital taxes it has cut. Research by the Nevin institute found that the implicit tax rate on workers in Ireland is 15% above the EU average, while employers' PRSI is 56% below. Regressive taxes on consumption are above the EU average while our taxes on capital are less than half those in Germany, Denmark, Belgium, the UK and Italy, and less than a third of those in France. That is what a tax policy looks like when we have a country run for those with wealth at the expense of ordinary people. Unless we make structural changes to how we fund and run our State and unless we take profit out of Government policies, we will never make real progress on addressing the crisis in housing, the cost of living or health. There is a need for change in Ireland. This budget does not offer it. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael will not offer it. We need a left government willing to make that change and run this country for the benefit of workers and communities, not the superrich."

My goal for budget 2025 was to support farm incomes as well as the continued development of the agrifood industry, by building on the significant supports put in place over the lifetime of this Government.",
                "With those objectives in mind, a total of €2.112 billion has been allocated to my Department for the coming year, which includes €85 million for new measures. This is an increase of €158 million year on year, or 8.1% above the 2024 provision. This is in addition to the €1.2 billion of EU funding in direct payments to farmers, funded outside of my Department's Vote. The provision supports incomes in the vulnerable sectors, but also provides investment support at farm level across the sectors and for our agrifood and fisheries processing sectors as well. In making this provision, the Government has recognised the critical importance of the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors as engines of employment creation and economic growth, especially in rural areas.",
                "The growth and development of the tillage sector is a strategic objective of this Government. In budget 2025, I am fully delivering on my commitment of a €100 per hectare payment for farmers who planted tillage and field-grown food crops for harvest 2024. This is in addition to the €10 million straw incorporation commitment in this budget, as well as the €10 million protein aid scheme commitment funded under Pillar 1 of the Common Agricultural Policy. Just three years ago, targeted payments to support the tillage sector overall amounted to just €3 million in total, and that was for the protein aid scheme. This year they will be €50 million.",
                "Earlier this year, I published a ten-point plan to develop and support our growing dairy beef sector. To further encourage this development, I am doubling the current payment per eligible calf from €20 to €40. As my aim is to encourage greater integration of the dairy and beef sectors, the allocation of this funding will be agreed in consultation with the farm organisations in due course. I have increased targeted supports to the beef sector in successive years now through the suckler carbon efficiency programme and the national beef welfare programme. Yesterday, I increased the payment per cow and calf from €200 in 2024 to €225 next year. I will also continue to fund the national genotyping programme which is making a significant contribution to the development of both the beef and dairy sectors. These measures support farm incomes but also deliver on efficiency, environmental and animal welfare goals at farm level.",
                "With regard to the sheep sector, I am also increasing the current rate of €8 per ewe under the national sheep welfare scheme by €5 bringing it to €13, which now delivers a combined €25 payment per ewe. This is a 150% increase in funding - from €10 to €25 - since I became Minister and is by far the largest payment ever made to sheep farmers.",
                "Regarding the farmer group known as the forgotten farmers, I have always affirmed my commitment to resolving this issue. I am pleased that in budget 2025 I will be able to open the scheme for this group with an initial funding contribution of €5 million provided. I am very glad to be in a position to now progress a scheme that has long been spoken about and that will also be followed with additional budgetary provision in budget 2026. This is certainly a significant step in this budget.",

The objective is to ensure fewer young Irish people have to travel abroad to complete their veterinary studies. The selection of the South East Technological University and the Atlantic Technological University will help to achieve this objective. It will also make a significant contribution to balanced regional development. Of the €50 million committed, my Department will be providing €25 million, with €5 million of that provided from the Department's Vote for 2025.",
                "Over €700 million will be spent in support of farm families in their efforts to tackle the challenges of climate, biodiversity and water quality in 2025. I have provided an increased provision of €60 million for ACRES. This will bring funding for the scheme in 2025 to €260 million. This follows my decision to accept all 55,000 participants into the scheme. I have also committed €40 million in capital funding for the development of a biomethane industry. This commitment for early delivery in 2025 is matched with €5 million in funding, with the remainder to be paid in 2026.",
                "My recently published plan to secure the nitrates derogation is fully funded under this budget. Farmers have made significant commitments to improving water quality, as shown during the recent visit by the European Commission's nitrates team to Ireland. I am supporting these efforts through capital and programme funding, with at least €61 million being provided for the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, in 2025. In this context, further to my introduction of a dedicated 70% nutrient importation storage scheme, subject to European Commission approval, I will open a 60% grant-aided nutrient storage scheme with a separate investment ceiling of €90,000. This will allow farmers to invest in nutrient storage under a dedicated investment ceiling, while also allowing them to invest in other measures on their holdings up to an additional €90,000 investment ceiling.",
                "Over the lifetime of this Government, €800 million has been spent on the seafood sector. The allocation for the fisheries and seafood sector in 2025 is €177 million. This will support continued investment in our piers and harbours, as well as provide investment for the seafood sector under a range of schemes, including: the inshore fleet economic assessment scheme, with payments of between €3,500 and €5,000 to inshore fishing vessels; the inshore fisheries scheme for small-scale coastal fishing vessels, with enhanced grant intensity rates of between 80% and 100% to support both on-board and on-shore investments; a lobster V-notching scheme to support fishing incomes and improve the sustainability of this fishery; a sustainable fisheries scheme providing support for on-board investment in sustainable fishing gear; a seafood processing capital investment scheme that will provide important support for capital investment in the seafood processing sector; and an aquaculture capital investment scheme that will provide support to aquaculture operators in the context of capital investment. The seafood training scheme supporting the development of skills and knowledge across the fisheries, aquaculture and seafood processing sectors will operate next year, as will the opening of a new young fishers scheme which provides support to young fishers under the age of 40 in purchasing their first fishing vessel, with grant rates of up to 40% of the cost of the vessel up to a maximum amount of €250,000. Additional schemes in 2025 will support producer organisations as well as community-led development within 10 km of the coast via the fisheries local action groups, as well as a seafood innovation scheme.",
                "The agri-taxation measures announced by my colleague the Minister for Finance, Deputy Chambers, demonstrate the Government’s commitment to retain key taxation measures that will support us in developing the sector in 2025. These measures are significant. For example, stock reliefs have been extended for a further three years, to the end of 2027. This is incredibly important for young farmers and those entering farm partnership, including for farm succession purposes. The capital acquisition tax agricultural relief, which is worth approximately €250 million per annum to farmers, has been retained. Following consultation with stakeholders and in order to ensure that this relief benefits genuine farmers rather than speculators, a new provision requiring the disponer to retain land for at least six years before benefiting from the capital acquisition tax relief, is being introduced. This is entirely consistent with the intention behind the relief, and my and this Government's objective to make sure we are looking to support young farmers and family farm transfers through this important support.",
                "The list of farm safety investments eligible for accelerated capital allowances has been extended, very much driven by my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Heydon, who will cover this, and flat-rate compensation for farmers will also increase from the current 4.8% to 5.1% from 1 January next year.",
                "I welcome the fact that an opportunity to avail of an exemption from the residential zoned land tax in 2025 is being provided for farmers who carry out genuine economic activity on their land if they seek to have it rezoned. It is critically important that we take measures to progress our housing policies, but this new provision addresses the legitimate concerns of genuine farmers.",
                "Considerable work has already been undertaken in recent months in relation to the introduction of an income volatility measure. There are lots of complexities to it, however, and it will require detailed legislation. I look forward to working with the Department of Finance to build on this with a view to having the necessary legislative parameters addressed in advance of budget 2026. I recognise the very strong commitment and recognition given for the need for an income volatility measure in our taxation system given by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Chambers, in his budget speech yesterday.",
                "Stripping out the exceptional Brexit adjustment reserve and Covid funding, this is the biggest funding package ever delivered for this sector. It succeeds in maintaining a strategic focus on the long-term drivers of success for the sector, while also addressing the more immediate challenges. I am satisfied that following intensive engagement we have succeeded in obtaining a balanced package that will support the sustainable development of our agriculture, forestry and fisheries sectors in 2025 and beyond. This is a strong message to our farmers and fishers that this Government values them and will continue to support them. I commend this budget to the House."

The budget provides for a series of targeted additional supports for sectors that need it most, and suckler, beef, tillage and sheep farmers will all benefit. We know the importance of the livestock sector, particularly sheep and suckler farms, as the bedrocks of economic activity in rural communities. An additional €25 per calf for suckler farmers and €5 extra per ewe for sheep farmers marks further progress in the income supports that have been made available by the Government. Increased funds will be available for tillage farmers following an exceptionally challenging 12 months. Funding for ACRES has been increased to €260 million as we seek to match the ambition of the 55,000 farmers who signed up to the scheme. A series of important agri-taxation measures have been renewed to assist young farmers and encourage generational renewal. Increased inheritance tax thresholds reflect the rise in land prices. In contrast, Sinn Féin proposed to increase capital acquisitions tax rates while cosying up to the Social Democrats, which wants to cut agri-taxation reliefs despite the damage that would do to succession on farms in rural communities. Indeed, agriculture failed to warrant a single mention in Deputy Mary Lou McDonald's budget address to this House.",

Concerns about succession, incomes and the need for policy certainty have dominated these discussions. Budget 2025 could not resolve all of these issues - no one budget can - but it again underlines our commitment to work with farmers to address them. In the past four and half years, the sector has navigated a series of difficult and often unpredictable shocks. It has proven the resilience of the sector and I am confident there is a bright future for agriculture in Ireland. We are facing into the next quarter of a century knowing that we will have to produce 70% more food to feed a world population predicted to grow to 10 billion by 2050. Food that is produced safely, sustainably and to the highest standards will be required and Ireland is well placed to continue to produce that food.",

It is not a journey that begins tomorrow or that started yesterday; it is one that is already well under way. In the same way that we have turned the trend on our emissions, we will turn the trend on water quality, of that I have no doubt. This is a sector with a very strong story to tell. The €21.6 million that I am making available for research and development will ensure Irish agriculture continues to operate at the cutting edge of innovation.",

Unfortunately, ten people have lost their lives on Irish firms so far in 2024. Every death is one too many. I am determined to continue to work to make Irish farms safer places to live and work and we can do that by supporting farmers to invest in their farms. The list of eligible items under the ACAs for farm safety will include sheep handling units, cattle crushes and races, calving gates, livestock monitors and sliding or roller doors. These investments not only make farms safer but more efficient places to work. This accelerated tax write-off will be available in addition to the 60% TAMS grant available for these farm safety items. Some 30% of all applications under TAMS 3 have been for farm safety items, reflecting the appetite among farmers to improve the safety of their farms.",

I commend the budget to the House."

                "Two thirds of the landmass of Ireland is agricultural land, so the measures we take on-farm to improve water quality, biodiversity and soil health and to store more carbon have a massive impact on our wider environment. For the fifth year in a row, we are putting funding in place to pay farmers to take the right measures to improve our environment and secure the long-term future of the family farm, be it through ACRES, the EIPs, the soil sampling programme, the red clover and multispecies sward measures or the organic farming scheme.",
                "Since this Government took office in 2020, we have made huge progress in organic farming. We have trebled the number of organic farmers to over 5,000 today and I am pleased to say that this number will continue to grow, thanks to the €67 million in funding for organic farming that l have secured for budget 2025. We have gone from 1.6% of all agricultural land being farmed organically in 2020 to 5% now, and we are on track to meet our target of 10% of organically farmed land by 2030. The funding I have secured for 2025 will allow us to continue on this positive trajectory by opening the organic farming scheme to new applicants in the coming weeks. We will see further increases in organic production in Ireland in the coming years as a result of this increased participation, and marketing the additional product is a Government priority. Indeed, earlier this week, I was in Germany for the launch of Bord Bia’s EU organic beef and lamb campaign, which will showcase the very best of Irish organic beef and lamb in a number of key markets in continental Europe. The potential to grow our organic exports is enormous. In addition to growing participation in organic farming and increasing our marketing footprint, we need to continue to invest in processing capacity. I am particularly pleased, therefore, that we are committing €3.5 million to the organic processing investment grant scheme for 2025.",
                "Forestry has massive potential. Creating 8,000 ha per year of new forests of many varieties will allow us to deliver for climate, nature, wood and people. We have backed the forestry programme 2023-27 with a €1.3 billion budget and, since the programme opened last September, we have issued licences for new afforestation for a total of over 6,000 ha. Thanks to sustained investment in increased operational efficiencies since the Government took office, the Department has the capacity to issue sufficient licences to meet the climate action plan target of 8,000 ha per year. The funding of €91 million secured for forestry in budget 2025 will underpin the diverse range of tree planting options under the forestry programme, among other schemes run through the forestry division, including the climate action performance payment for ash plantation owners. I want to put on record the Government’s commitment to the target of 8,000 ha of new forests per annum. I encourage farmers and landowners to consider tree planting as an additional income stream. I look forward to my Department supporting all valid licence holders who plant trees under the forestry programme in 2025 at the highly attractive grant and premium rates on offer through the programme.",
                "We have secured a budget of €8.5 million for horticulture in 2025, which will support growers and the sector to reach the ambition set out in the national strategy for horticulture 2023-27. In addition, I am delighted to confirm to the House that horticultural growers who planted and declared field-grown food crops in 2024 on their BISS applications are eligible and will receive the €100 per hectare tillage payment announced as part of budget 2025, which means an extra €1.34 million going to our horticulture sector.",
                "Before I conclude, there are some critical schemes whose continued funding into 2025 I want to welcome. The €2.75 million for the red clover silage and multispecies sward measures will help farmers to reduce their reliance on expensive nitrogen fertilisers, delivering for farmers’ pockets but also for biodiversity, water quality and emissions reduction. The funding of €6 million for phase 3 of the soil sampling and analysis programme will give farmers the data they need to better understand the health of their soil, which is critical to all life on this planet. There will be a doubling of funding for social farming under the rural innovation development fund. I cannot speak highly enough of the social farming movement and the wonderful people I have met throughout the country who participate in it. It is one of the great positive news stories of Irish agriculture and I am delighted to have secured this additional funding.",

                "I am glad to have the opportunity to respond to the budget and the efforts that have been made with regard to agriculture. The broader point is that the Government had huge financial resources to bring to the table for this budget. Many people out there, particularly those in rural areas and across the western seaboard, recognise that it is a part of the world that has had the least investment in the past and, therefore, has the most potential if it gets the correct investment and the chance to try to move forward.",
                "Some of that has happened in this budget but not enough. That is where we stand on it. We recognise where there has been progress made. That progress needs to be acknowledged, but there is so much more to do and so much more distance to be travelled. The Minister mentioned how many people, when he speaks to farmers, are talking about certainty for the future and they ask how are they going to have a future where they can see that their children or their children's children will still be on the land, farming and having a prosperous future. Many of them do not see that because there are other options there which pay much better and which do not have the same volatility and sense of uncertainty around it. We need to bring that certainty to agriculture and that sense that there is a future there for people to go back on to the family farm. Some of the measures that are talked of here will do something about that but will certainly not go far enough.",
                "I was amused to see the issue about putting additional money into ACRES. I am getting calls every day from farmers complaining that ACRES is simply not working for them, that they cannot get their payments, do not know what their scores are, do not know what is happening and the Department tells them that its IT system is not working. It is just a mess. There needs to be recognition that a complete hames has been made of ACRES up to now. To put more money into it at a time when the Department does not have it straightened out raises the point that the Department had better get it right for farmers who want to play the game, get into that sector, enhance and maintain the biodiversity they have on their farm, do things properly, and get paid properly for the public good they provide for that.",
                "On the forgotten farmers, who were mentioned, the Minister put some money into that. I do not believe he put enough. I believe more could be done for them in that respect because they are a sector who have been left behind for far too long. We need to catch up in that respect.",
                "On the residential zoned land tax, the Minister has recognises there needs to be, and will be, some movement made in respect of farmers who are actively farming. We need the detail on that. Farmers have been promised before that they can be zoned out of it. I spoke to the Minister for housing two years ago about this and he told me there was no problem, to just get the land rezoned and that there was no issue. There is an issue and we are now being told it is going to be done. We need the detail as to how that is going to happen because we simply have not had that in the past.",
                "The reality for the majority of people on small holdings who are trying to manage and who want to see a future for their children to farm the piece of land they have is that they do not know what the certainty is. The schemes are too short. They are for a year or two, then they are gone, and people do not know where the next scheme is going to come from or what is going to happen. That is the stuff the Government controls. The other side of that, which the Minister mentioned, is income volatility which is a huge problem. No sector knows where it will be or what income it will have for the produce brought to the mart, sent to the factory or wherever. The processors still have the ball at their toe and still control that sector. The Minister mentioned the organic sector. It is the very same people who control how that is processed and where they will get the money from that. Farmers are very uncertain because they see the big players dominating all the time and there needs to be a firm hand of Government to ensure there will be fair play, that the people who take all of the risks and put in all of the work get a fair return for that work. That is the issue farmers have and that is why more young people are choosing not to go in to farming.",
                "I mention the general things in the budget that have been really let down. In a time when we have massive resources, the issues of investment and infrastructural investment in particular are a real problem. This is the case with the western seaboard and the roads in the west. The N17 is a road we have been crying out for years for something to be done with it. There have been a huge number of accidents and problems on it and there is no money for the like of that. We have no money for the western rail corridor and so many other big projects that could make a big difference in the country.",
                "I recognise that some work has been done but it does not go nearly far enough for the kind of ambition we need to have to get balanced development throughout the country. We have to relieve Dublin and revive the rest and that means we have to invest in the rest. We have to ensure we can create opportunity and that opportunity will create more activity, which will create more opportunity. That is how we can get the economies in places like where I come from in the west, like Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo or Galway, where we have opportunity, to come back up again. They will only come up if we invest in them and that is where I think this Government has fallen down."

Whenever there were 20,000 people from Donegal, Mayo, Clare, Limerick and the west, but predominantly from Donegal, here, the Tánaiste, Micheál Martin, said the scheme would be the biggest redress scheme in the history of the State. He said it would be €3.5 billion. It is estimated the defective apartment scheme will be around €2.5 billion. There is a total of €6 billion for those two schemes and, of course, pyrite is still ongoing. What was the allocation in the budget yesterday for all of these schemes? It was €70 million. By my estimation, it would take 85 years for everybody who is entitled to redress to get it.",
                "It is time to be honest here. Micheál Martin needs to be honest. He was never serious about a redress scheme that everybody could access. The scheme we have now is designed to exclude most families. The Minister knows there are people in their 60s and 70s in our home county of Donegal who cannot access the finance. They were not given a 100% redress scheme which more than 3,000 families were given in Dublin and north Leinster. They got 100% redress; our families in the west have not got it. That is why most families cannot access the scheme and why the allocation in this budget is €70 million. The Government knows the scheme is not designed to facilitate proper redress. We will go to the people soon and the people will have their say. It is time for honesty. When we were feeling all the sympathy and support from all around Ireland for people who did no wrong, with their lives falling apart, and Micheál Martin said we will have the biggest redress scheme in the history of the State of €3.5 billion, he never meant it, he was never serious and the people will have their say on that very soon."

It speaks of a commitment to disability services, but where is the plan to make it work? CHO 5 is the third worst affected area for CDNT contacts. On housing, we called for the delivery of 21,500 social and affordable homes for 2025. The Government, however, did not announce any new housing at all, despite having a surplus of €24 billion. There is no plan or intention to make childcare affordable. Sinn Féin brought out a good paper on that. Average workers have also been left behind in this budget. We would have taken the first €45,000 of every worker's income out of the USC, but the Government opted instead to give an income tax package that benefits a person earning €150,000 to the tune of €959.

We are back to that again. The year before that, it was nothing. It was zero of an increase. Now we are not guaranteeing an increase in pay for early years educators at a time when rooms are being closed by providers because they cannot staff them. They cannot find staff and early years educators are leaving the sector. The 65 cent increase that came in this year was a slap in the face to those professionals and it is deeply disappointing that there is nothing guaranteed for them in this budget."

NTF funding will also support capital projects in a range of areas: €150 million will be invested in innovative equipment in the further education and training sector to drive workforce transformation in key areas for our economy; €150 million will be used to develop research skills, including supporting research infrastructure; €130 million will provide key training facilities for specialist skills identified as being in short supply; €20 million will be provided for universal design for learning to enhance accessibility across our campuses; and €150 million will be provided for fit-for-purpose decarbonised training facilities at tertiary level and contribute to the sector meeting our ambitious climate action targets.",
                "As a country we have seen significant income growth over the past few years but this has been coupled with increased costs. It is vitally important that we continue to support students who need financial assistance. This is why I am increasing all student grants and student part-time fee grant thresholds. The special rate of maintenance threshold will increase from €26,200 to €27,400 and there will be at least a 15% increase to all other thresholds. I am pleased to also announce that PhD stipends will increase from €22,000 to €25,000 per annum. As well as this, the following once-off cost measures will be implemented straight away to assist students with the challenges of the cost of living: a 33% reduction in student fees for 14,000 apprentices attending higher education institutes; a €1,000 reduction in the student contribution fee that will benefit an estimated 103,000 higher education students who are eligible for the free fees initiative; an increase to the postgraduate fee contribution grant from €4,000 to €5,000 for eligible students; and an additional €10 million to the student assistance fund. Alongside these measures I am pleased to announce that for the first time €5,000 of any scholarship received by a student will not be counted as income in SUSI means tests. The eligibility criteria for the schemes will be expanded to allow students who have certain immigration permissions to apply for grants.",
                "This Government recognises the significant challenges facing students in securing appropriate and affordable accommodation to enable their participation in higher education. I am pleased to announce an investment of €7.5 million in recurrent funding for student accommodation initiatives, in addition to the €100 million already committed through the NDP, and €6 million of this is activation of approximately 1,200 student accommodation beds for long-term leasing as part of the technological university student accommodation programme. At least 30% of all of the beds activated under this programme will be provided at below market rates for target groups.",
                "With regard to disabilities, I am determined that our college communities and campuses become more reflective of our society. Students with disabilities, including intellectual disabilities, have been under-represented in higher education. This is why I am proud to announce a package of measures that will support students with disabilities through their tertiary education.",
                "I have extended the provision of courses for students with intellectual disabilities. Eleven institutions across Ireland will provide courses this academic year and this will give students more choices and afford them the opportunity to study alongside their friends and be nearer their families. There are other initiatives in the budget but unfortunately, I do not have the time to outline them. The allocation that the Minister for Public Expenditure, NDP Delivery and Reform and the Government have allowed me to utilise will enhance the offering for students and those who work in our universities, colleges and educational training boards, ETBs, and I commend the budget to the House."

This is an increase of 12% on 2024 levels of funding and is reflective of incremental changes in funding for disability services, surpassing €3 billion for the first time.",
                "Since 2020, investment in this area has increased by €1.2 billion. In securing this funding, my continued overarching focus for 2025 is to maintain and enhance the provision of person-centred services, by addressing cost increases in delivery of service, providing for demographic change and ensuring services are aligned with the UNCRPD.",
                "For 2025, I have secured an overall increase of €336 million. This additional funding will allow for the following developments across a range of services: €106 million to address the full year costs of this year’s expected delivery on priority residential places as well as support for approximately 70 new residential placements; in the order of 50 Tusla-related responses; and enhancements to existing residential places and support for the upgrade of some existing placement opportunities for new residents. It will provide for additional HSE housing co-ordinators, and it will also support the transition of approximately 20 people from congregated settings and nursing homes to more appropriate living arrangements in the community; and €30.8 million is being allocated for respite and supports to assist people to continue living in their own homes. This allocation will support full-year costs of respite expected to be delivered in 2024, as well as development of services in 2025. The assignment of funding to overnight, day, and alternative respite such as weekend clubs, equine therapy respite, after-school clubs and tea-time respite will be confirmed in the coming period. This will also include the full year cost of around 180 intensive home support and supported living packages delivered in 2024, as well as an additional 150 packages in 2025.",
                "In the area of home support and personal assistance hours, there will be an uplift of 40,000 and 20,000 respectively. Importantly though, I have also set aside additional funding for 2025 to begin the progressive alignment of the personal assistance rate and the home support rate with older persons' services. This in turn should hopefully support the capacity to delivery current hours and further expansion of services, as we continue to develop this important area under the action plan for disability services.",
                "On children’s services, with funding already provided in recent years for additional posts to enhance the capacity of the children’s disability network teams, CDNTs, there will be further funding available in 2025 to continue recruitment. For 2025, there is funding for an additional 20 senior therapist posts, 20 staff grade posts, 20 health and social care assistant posts and 15 clinical trainee posts.",
                "The ongoing assessments of need waitlist initiative launched in May has been proving very successful, with 1,100 assessments of needs cleared across June, July and August through the private sector. I am earmarking a further €10 million for this work, which in turn frees up resources to provide therapeutic supports to children with complex needs. A total of €40.3 million is allocated for day services, adult multidisciplinary therapy and neuro-rehabilitation supports. This includes the full-year cost of 2024 school leaver placements as well as the new cohort of school leavers in 2025.",
                "While there is often focus on therapy provision for children, I am also starting the development of a process to provide multidisciplinary therapy services for adults, which have been long sought. The initial funding will complete a mapping exercise to assess existing provision of services and allow for further development of models of provision. Having also invested heavily in the roll-out of community neuro-rehabilitation teams in the last couple of years, there is funding set aside to ensure the levels of staffing required can be achieved to deliver these crucial supports in the community.",
                "Pay cost pressures also arise across the sector and funding to support the agreement struck with sector 39 service providers is separately accounted for. A combined additional allocation of €4 million will be made available to support disability equality measures. This increase in funding will enable the decision support service to continue to implement the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act 2015 and will facilitate the National Disability Authority, NDA, to provide enhanced policy advice to Government on disability issues. The funding will also support the implementation of the recently launched autism innovation strategy, building on existing supports and services by providing a dedicated funding stream for an autism innovation fund of €2 million. In addition, the 2025 allocation includes €18 million in non-core expenditure.",
                "Earlier this year I announced the development of the first ever multi-annual capital investment strategy for disability services. In 2025, €27 million will be provided in capital funding to build and develop infrastructure across respite, residential and day services."

I question what is actually new in this budget for new measures that are going to be taken to increase services for disabled people. We had a disability capacity review which was very detailed. It said there was a huge amount of unmet need and that to address it and demographic change up to 2032 would take an additional €80 million to €90 million of funding per year. I do not see where that is allocated in the budget and I would love to get some clarity on it. Disabled people deserve better. I do not have time to go into the cost-of-disability payment.

It is the exact same thing that was there last year. It does not actually make a difference for apprentices. This is despite the fact that we know apprentices are really struggling. Just today, an apprentice told me that he is earning €211 per week after more than a year of training. That is simply not good enough.

We needed it yesterday and we needed a plan last year but, last year, there was nothing in the budget with regard to student accommodation. I am glad to hear it mentioned this year and that €100 million in capital is going into it but, over three years, that is simply not good enough. The Government needs to wake up to the reality of the situation for students. Students are dropping out because they have nowhere to live. Students are commuting long distances. What we have is a situation where students who can afford to pay for student accommodation have a bit of a college life but they also have a lot more time to study. This means that those students who are commuting because they cannot afford or get student accommodation cannot do the courses they want to do and are dropping out and are also not able to study and get the grades others can."

Childcare fees have been brought down twice and are now half what they were thanks to the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman. Hot school meals for all children in primary education are being provided for. There is free public transport for children up to the age of eight, free GP care for children up to the age of seven and free schoolbooks not just for children in primary school, but also those in secondary school. There is also €1,000 off the cost of the student contribution for students in third level education and half-price transport for young people up to the age of 25.",
                "One in four children in school in Ireland has a special need. That has not been addressed properly in past decades.

The integration of children with special needs into mainstream schools is well under way with most children with special needs now attending such schools.",
                "The national broadband plan is a project to bring fibre broadband to every home in Ireland. It has been immensely successful. There has been a lot of attention and focus recently on the Government's competence and ability to deliver capital projects. This project, which happens to be the largest and worth more than €2.5 billion, is on time and on budget. By the end of 2026, every home, farm and business in rural Ireland will have access to fibre direct to the premises. I want to make sure that happens in urban Ireland as well because a number of black spots where fibre is not available are emerging. People in these areas use some kind of hybrid fibre with speeds of less than 100 Mbps but they need the same 1 Gbps level of connection that will be available in rural Ireland. I have asked my Department to focus on urban black spots. I have worked with the communications regulator, ComReg, which will shortly be producing a map showing where those areas are. It is a much smaller project than was required to connect up rural Ireland. If we can deliver fibre broadband to every home in the Black Valley in Kerry, we can certainly do it in Glenageary and Dundrum. That will be a focus for next year.",

This would allow for all types of marine activity and recreation to take place, based on models that are recognised around the world. The very successful GAA club Cuala is also looking for new sports facilities. I wish it luck in its applications.",

A total of €16 billion is being put aside between this year and next year into long-term funds for investment in infrastructure so we can have a countercyclical economy that can avoid the ups and downs of the past."

In a year when the report of the Citizens' Assembly on Drugs had recommendation after recommendation for increased funding and a priority for addiction services, this Government either forgot or could not be bothered to include any such reference in the budget book. This is the first time this has happened since I was elected, but it is not the first time this Government has forgotten about those working in and those benefiting from addiction services. Time after time, from section 39 pay increases to the failure to restore task force funding, those in addiction and those who love them know that they are being forgotten about by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. This is not just about individuals but about communities, families and people's futures. It is all about investing in recovery from and tackling addiction and supporting communities. Sinn Féin would have invested more than €35 million aimed at properly transforming our resource and community addiction sector and actually beginning to recover our communities, our families and our people.",

Cork city and its people have sent a clear message through a series of meetings and protests I organised that we will not accept an unreliable bus service. The solution that Bus Éireann and the NTA have come up with is to cut more than 800 scheduled services every week, starting on 20 October, and running through the winter months. Now, instead of people standing for buses that turn up, they will be standing for buses that will be full and will drive past them. This is an absolute disgrace. Would any second city in any state in Europe put up with a bus service that does not deliver, does not turn up and that is in crisis? There was no money in this budget to support Bus Éireann in Cork. The NTA has an awful lot to answer for and it is about time this Government, if it is really serious about climate change and the environment, delivered the buses we need in Cork."

However, I ask any of the Ministers or Ministers of State here if any of the extra beds mentioned in the budget are part of the recently agreed public-private partnership to develop more than 530 public nursing home beds at the developer's stated cost of a whopping €471,698 per bed. Not content with building the most expensive children's hospital the world has ever seen, this Government is now building the most expensive nursing home beds in the world. The deal, which the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, signed off on in 2022, means the HSE will be paying the venture capitalist developer €24 million annually for 25 years. This amounts to an eye-watering total of €600 million, or €1,132,000 per bed of taxpayers' money. Does the Government think this is value for money? Where is the value for the taxpayers? Where is the oversight? Was this even put out to tender? There are multiple specialist builders who could deliver the same high-quality facilities for just under €200,000.",

Sure why not spend almost €1.2 million on a bed because it is only taxpayers' money? Like the national children's hospital, these nursing home beds promised for 2024 are not finished either. This is yet another fiasco to sit alongside the bicycle shed and the security hut and yet more proof that Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil cannot be trusted with the public's money. Our population is ageing and we need more affordable nursing home beds at a normal value-for-money cost that would be delivering for our older people and not this Government paying public money through the nose for the same beds. It is time to call a stop to the reckless and feckless spendthrift ways of this Government. It is time to call an election."

It is very powerful and concerns the way this budget, in reality, fails families with children who have additional needs. She really puts her finger on it. This applies to all the tens of thousands of children with additional needs, but even more generally, it speaks to the nature of the budget the Government has introduced. She writes:",

It’s privatisation by stealth: A quiet acknowledgement that families are being left to shoulder the burden alone.",

The Minister for Finance told us yesterday this money has the potential to be transformational. What is there then? There are an extra 85 therapists in a system where 110,000 children are on waiting lists and the Government is only giving people a little bit of extra money.

The only option for families like ours is to pursue staggeringly expensive private therapies. Occupational therapy alone for my daughter costs €95 a week — that’s €5,000 a year, after tax, from our own pockets, on just one therapy that the public system simply can’t offer. Then add the costs of speech and language therapy, dietician care, and the separate courses I’ve pursued to try to learn to assist her at home.",

Cyra has been failed in so many different ways. I will go through some of them. This case encapsulates all the different ways children, vulnerable children, children with additional needs and children with disabilities are failed by this State every day. Ultimately, this comes down to a political choice - to choose to fight for the rights of Apple and the rights of big multinational corporations as opposed to fighting for the rights of these children.",

                "Cyra was born at 37 weeks and had some complications arising from birth. Six months on, her mother was contacting the public health nurse looking for assistance relating to her child not sleeping, being extremely sensitive, never stopping crying and so on. The only help that her mother was given at that time was an online parenting course. Fast forward to when Cyra was 18 months old. Her mother was very worried that she had regressed and that there was something serious happening. She was told by the State not to get her hopes up, that this can take years and was advised, exactly like Ciara Reilly says, that if she could afford it, to go private. Charlotte went private but was failed there. Cyra ended up being assessed by a psychologist who was a fraud and who recommended medication that almost killed her. Then Cyra finally had her assessment of need. Her mother was ecstatic because she thought this was then Cyra would start to get what she needs but Charlotte says \"Little did I know, this was only the start of the rodeo.\" She found out that the assessment of need was done incorrectly and was told that Cyra was on a waiting list to be reassessed. She was brought in again but, again, she got nothing. Another assessment was carried out but this was also completed incorrectly because it was only done by a psychologist.",
                "That brings us up to April of this year. Charlotte went down the legal route and finally Cyra got an assessment of need. Then she was awaiting the report. Six weeks passed but there was nothing from the CDNT, no assessment of need. Charlotte knew that school applications were opening and she did not have a report to support her applications. She could not wait any longer so she pushed and got a service statement. The service statement says that Cyra will get services in October 2026. That means her file may be opened and she may be offered a so-called early bird course. Charlotte has been looking for assistance, in effect, since her daughter was born but by that stage, in October 2026, Cyra will be eight. There are 52 mistakes in the report. There is no cognitive assessment, which means that the vast majority of schools will simply not look at her application. She has applied to 32 schools this year with no success. Now, with her updated report, she meets the criteria for only four of those schools. She has had two CAMHS refusals, two home care package application refusals and her mother says that now she is effectively locked out from the private sector too as the therapists keep moving.",
                "I will stop because my time is up but I could go on in terms of the way that Cyra is being failed by this State. Ultimately, that is a political choice. We are obviously weeks away from a general election being called. This Government promised again and again that it would ratify the optional protocol to the UNCRPD. It had better do it or it will be letting families like Cyra's down extremely badly."

Additional funding of €3.8 million, including pay, has been provided to the national cultural institutions to support the sustained protection and presentation of our national collections.

It has been really positive and co-operative, leading to better governance and better outcomes. I am very pleased to announce some of those outcomes today.",

                "This year we were treated to an amazing summer of sport thanks to the incredible performance of Team Ireland at the Olympic Games and the Paralympic Games. The Government promised to respond to that success with financial support and we are sticking to that promise. Budget 2025 represents a landmark moment for sport in Ireland. Two years ahead of schedule, the Government has more than doubled our investment in sport compared with 2018 levels. This fulfils a key commitment under the national sports policy from 2018 to double investment in sport to more than €220 million by 2027. I am glad to confirm that the 2025 allocation for sport and recreation amounts to €231 million, which is an increase of 10% on last year.",
                "As Deputies will be aware, the Minister and I announced the largest ever investment in sports facilities in the history of the State with an unprecedented €250 million allocated under the community sports facilities fund. This week we are announcing the largest ever budget for sport in the State's history. I can confirm that the overall allocation provided to Sport Ireland, which is tasked by the Government with responsibility for the development of sport in Ireland, amounts to €115.16 million. This substantial allocation will provide sustained funding for the national governing bodies for sport and our local sports partnerships.",
                "In 2018, the total core funding for the national governing bodies of sport and local sports partnerships stood at €16.9 million. The figure now stands at €30 million. Additional funding to support the delivery of the national sports policy is also being provided. I am establishing a dedicated disability in sport funding stream for Sport Ireland to ensure that everybody, regardless of their ability, has the right to participate in sport and enjoy physical activity. High-performance funding is being increased by over €1 million. Regarding my role as the first ever Minister of State with responsibility for physical education, I am delighted to announce increased funding for the expansion of the active school flag programme again. This will allow more schools to get more active more often and allow for the full roll-out of the programme in post-primary schools.",
                "Regarding funding for the Gaeltacht, tá ardú tagtha ar mhaoiniú do chlár na Gaeltachta go €106.9 milliún, ardú de 6% ar an maoiniú le haghaidh 2024. Leis sin, tacófar leis an nGaeilge agus déanfar a húsáid mar phríomhtheanga phobal na Gaeltachta a neartú tuilleadh. Tá níos mó airgid ag dul go hÚdarás na Gaeltachta. Tá infheistíocht sa straitéis ealaíona. Tá maoiniú don phlean digiteach. Tá maoiniú níos mó á thabhairt d'ionaid Ghaeilge agus chultúrtha ar fud na tíre.",

The lower levels of increased funding for sport and recreation will do nothing to bring about positive change to our sporting community. It certainly was not transformative. Once again, the Government's approach is simply to plaster over the cracks that are the result of decades of underfunding.",

Last week in Brussels, Sinn Féin facilitated a meeting between UEFA, the FAI and EU officials about the Brexit adjustment reserve fund. At that meeting, we asked if the FAI's case over the negative impact that Brexit had on the development of Irish football would have made Irish football eligible for this Brexit adjustment reserve fund. The EU officials said that the FAI's case ticked all the boxes and more. However, the Commission said that the Irish Government failed to apply for any of this funding for football. Once again, the Government has forgotten about Irish football. Once again, it has failed to fund Irish football academies. Once again, it has failed to kick-start the Irish football industry and invest in young Irish footballers.",

However, there is a continual lack of investment in sport and €1 million in the high-performance unit is not enough. Given the communities that have been failed, there are some measures that I would have questions about, particularly those that will enhance the ability of the well-off affluent clubs to access funding.",

The Government is transferring the ownership of the Dublin Institute of Technology, DIT, in Aungier Street to a private developer.

DIT in Aungier Street, which was previously located in Kevin Street, would have provided a perfect opportunity to develop sports and leisure facilities for an inner-city community that has been neglected for decades.",

The notion of giving €9 million for phone pouches should be reversed and the money should be given to special education."

                "I welcome the unprecedented €3.9 billion investment in transport infrastructure in the budget. Since 2020, when the Government entered office, it has increased by €1 billion in the Department alone. It has gone from just under €3 billion to just under €4 billion. This is an increase of €1 billion since the Government came office. Looking at public transport infrastructure in the first instance, which is my primary interest or first love as we are discussing transport, because I use it myself on a regular basis, as do most of my constituents in Kildare, those in the greater Dublin area, those in commuter belts and those in all of our urban centres, we have invested unprecedented moneys in public transport infrastructure and in large projects and we continue to do so. Among the schemes being rolled out in budget 2025 are additional BusConnects routes in Dublin, the commencement of regional BusConnects, which will feature in Cork, Galway, Limerick and our regional cities, new town services, phase 4 of Connecting Ireland, including Cork, Donegal, Tipperary, Cavan, Clare, Kilkenny and Laois, and many more investments in public transport services. We will also continue the fare reduction of 20% introduced last year, and the new measure whereby kids under nine years of age go free. This means young persons can avail of public transport and their parents do not have to worry about the cost. If they ever did, they do not have to do so now with regard to young folk taking up the opportunity to travel on the services.",
                "With regard to the big-ticket items, we will continue to spend heavily on the rail network. The strategic rail review was recently completed. It looks at 2050 but money has been pledged towards it for 2025. We do not have to wait 25 years for it to take effect, thankfully. Among the many projects we could speak about that are being funded is MetroLink. I had the pleasure of meeting the new programme director, Dr. Sean Sweeney, this afternoon in Leinster House. He is a very fine gentleman from New Zealand with a Mayo connection. He has come to supervise the big dig as work starts on the metro connection to the airport. I am very confident it is in good hands. It is such a critical piece of infrastructure. As the programme director observed, it is a new canvas. It is not plugging into legacy equipment or legacy connections. They have the luxury of being able to start and finish it on a new track and new rail. It is a very important project.",
                "We are continuing with the DART+ extensions, with DART+ Coastal North, DART+ Coastal South, DART+ West and DART+ South West. These are more usually known as Louth, Wicklow, Kildare and Meath. Effectively, these DART+ programmes will bring the highest quality, most regular, most frequent and most reliable commuter rail right around the commuter belt, effectively in an arc from Drogheda down and back around into Bray and Greystones.",
                "The DART+ Coastal North has now progressed. Planning permission has been lodged for it and it is now in the system. Dart+ West came out of planning quite recently. We are awaiting a planning decision on DART+ South West. Since coming into the role I have asked the NTA to look at bringing the routes even further and, for example, extending DART+ South West to Sallins, which is envisaged in the greater Dublin area scheme, and ultimately onto Newbridge and beyond. I have asked about the DART+ West line going beyond Maynooth, where it terminates, to Kilcock and even to Enfield as we go further. If we are going to continue to develop our commuter belt, for all the good reasons of distributed housing and providing more opportunities for people to live outside Dublin yet access employment and educational services in the capital, we must support it. This must be a public transport driven development and not a private vehicle one. It is very important that we continue to do this. The Wicklow line is already well served by the DART to Greystones but it is envisaged in the greater Dublin area strategy to bring the DART to Wicklow town itself. This investment would be money well spent.",
                "We also have 180 new carriages of the battery electric rail fleet being delivered. They will begin to make a difference. I know there are capacity issues, even today, on the commuter services in particular and that people are squeezed in. These 180 carriages have begun to arrive and some have already gone into service quite recently. More will be added to the fleet in the coming months. They will begin to help with capacity on the services. They are important aspects of the public transport picture.",
                "Looking to active travel, €1 million for every day of the year is being invested in the budget for walking and cycling infrastructure. Since 2020, when the Government came into office, we have delivered 222 km of greenways in the country. We have also seen the Safe Routes to School programme, which enables schoolchildren to access school safely, with comfort and convenience and, most importantly, in a way that is demarcated and separated out from traffic. There has been an investment of €1.8 billion in active travel since the Government came into office, including plugging 275 schools into the Safe Routes to School programme. It is a very important programme and long may it continue. I have seen it in action in number of schools and it is working extremely well.",
                "The roads network has an improvement this year of €1.365 billion committed to the national, regional and local roads networks. This includes €308 million for new national and local roads. The significant amount of €1.5 billion is another commitment to funding our roads and funding the infrastructure. This includes a maintenance budget, new roads, local roads, regional roads and supporting local authorities in their maintenance programmes and rolling out new initiatives. I will not get into the detail of individual projects now but I will say there are a number of specific roads about which concerns were raised over the summer, whereby particular projects in particular areas were perhaps at risk or at threat. People at Transport Infrastructure Ireland raised a flag and said certain projects may be unable to proceed because of the cost of labour, inflation and the cost of materials. We all know that building projects cost more tomorrow than they did yesterday, and this price escalation was a feature of construction. I have engaged with the Department and TII. The vast majority of these projects have been given the green light or I expect they will very soon. Certainly the councils will be instructed to tender in the coming days and weeks any project that is not yet tendered. This is a good result and a good win, and it is very important for our infrastructure. Colleagues may wish to engage with me on the detail of these and they are welcome to do so.",
                "An additional €40 million has been set aside to support councils in rolling out the speed limit programme coming into effect later this year. It will start with our local roads having a default speed limit of 60 km/h. As I have mentioned many times in conversation since I took on this role, this is not a target and it is not mandatory, it is a default. Councils and councillors reserve the local government exclusive function to vary it up, down or sideways, whatever they wish to do. It remains the preserve of local authorities where local road engineers and local elected members know their own terrain best. They can vary it. The default, unless specified otherwise, for all the boreens with the grass tufts in the middle of the road will be 60 km/h rather than 80 km/h. This makes a lot of sense. We will support the councils in doing this.",
                "Staying with motor vehicles, I am introducing a digital dashboard project in the Department. It is funded through the budget. It includes the replacement of our paper tax discs, insurance discs and NCT discs that we all tear out and, if you are like me, rip most of the time before slipping them into the dashboard every few months or every year when we get our renewal. This will become a thing of the past because it will be automated into a digital footprint that will travel with the vehicle and the driver as part of the national vehicle driver file. This is a project with our colleagues in the motor tax office in Shannon. They are doing a very fine job on the automation and digitalisation of the service. It will save paper. I believe 5 million discs are mailed out annually. It will save us all the hassle of trying to fidget with them and get them onto the dashboard and remember to put them in. It will enable our gardaí to have a view of a vehicle when it is travelling, using automatic number plate recognition on their handheld devices and in their squad cars for enforcement. It is a safety measure and an enforcement measure but it is also a convenience measure for all of us. It is something that is very welcome.",
                "Significant money is being placed in the maritime arena. The Port of Cork has been granted a €99 million investment. I was there on Friday and I visited the team. They are ready to go with renewable energy. If we are going to power this nation through having offshore wind and rigs and connecting them to the grid, we need to have the infrastructure to get the kit out to sea, plug it into the cables and get it back onshore so that we can power this country. The almost €100 million investment will go a long way towards doing this. I congratulate the team at the Port of Cork. There is also great potential in Rosslare, Shannon Foynes and other ports.",
                "I look forward to working with those in due course.",
                "The Coast Guard has an allocation of €70 million for a new project that is due that is primarily for the provision of a new helicopter fleet, which will be of vital importance to the safety and security of our coastal communities and islands. It will be multifunctional. It will be primarily for rescue and search and recovery operations but will also assist with other types of missions. The helicopters can go where normal vehicles cannot access, and where the helicopters cannot go, the drones can go. There are a number of drones in the fleet as well, some of which I have seen in action. I thank the very talented and committed team, both professional and volunteer, of the Coast Guard for the good work they are doing.",
                "On aviation, the budget includes a commitment to the regional airports. We are trying to balance the regional airports around the country for many reasons, not least the fact that we are constrained with a legacy planning cap for the time being at least. We are trying to work towards supporting the regional airports. There is a new fund of €17 million going towards Ireland West Airport Knock, Farranfore, Donegal and the other regional airports. I hope that will be of some support in helping to balance growth so that we do not have a situation in years to come where 86% of our connectivity is in one north Dublin location. It makes sense for many reasons to spread that around the country and bring it where the people are. That makes a lot of sense. There is a lot more I can say, but I will not because I am out of time. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to address Members on the budget, which I commend to the House."

If we are talking about building houses, obviously, we have to make sure we have the infrastructure in place. Roads, sewers, water and electricity are ferociously important. The land management agency funding for affordable housing is welcome. However, we must make sure that is spent wisely because we cannot go down the road of houses that cost an arm and a leg.

I would like clarification on that. It is a while since I went to school, but we had a locker, and if people can throw the phone into the locker, they do not need these pouches people are talking about that cost €9 million.

                "I welcome the money that is going into childcare because it is needed. The only thing is that there will always be people who ring us when we are driving home at night a couple of hours after having seen the budget. The owner of a nursing home with 50 people working for them rang me last night. The owner does not deprive the staff of more money, but these are the facts I was given. They are facing into a situation whereby they have 50 staff, and the raise in the minimum wage - I want to be clear that they do not want to deprive the staff - will cost them €80,000. Auto-enrolment is coming in and granted, it has been put off for a year, but they have put a figure of €25,000 to €30,000 on that. Nursing homes probably use either gas around Dublin or kerosene in some places in many parts of the country; the carbon tax raise will cost them approximately €2,000 or €2,500. Rates are going up. They tallied it all up for me. This is a small business. This is the part I really find difficult to understand. It will cost them approximately €130,000. That is €2,500 per week that is not there at the moment. Unless the Government comes in on the other side in a few months' time when it is renegotiating the bed price and they get that, this is all driving things in one direction, and where is it going? Up, up and up with everything. Unless they get it on that side, it will not balance on this side. It is something we need to watch. In fairness to those people, I want to be clear that they do not deprive anyone of the wage increase. They are not opposed to giving a wage increase, but the Government has to give more on the other side. That is it. The State will be paying more on that side. That needs to happen in the budgets in health. For it to balance on this side, it will have to go up on the other side. The health budget is basically doing the same thing only it is costing more. We need to watch that.",

I cannot see a whole lot in the budget for businesses around the country, unfortunately, to keep them going. The Minister, Deputy Peter Burke, is in the Chamber tonight. That is one thing that needs to be looked at to make sure we keep this small number of businesses going. Mr. Draghi did a report on competitiveness in the last few weeks that talked about multinationals. We are fairly reliant on them, and we welcome them. However, it has been said that we need to protect small operations as well.",
                "In the line of agriculture, we know there is a crisis in the suckler herd. There is no escape. There is a bit of an increase from what there was, but the number of farmers in it is going downwards. It was written very well, whoever the scribe was. One would nearly get the impression that there is €70 million more in ACRES, but there is not. It is a budget to cater for 55,000 more farmers. I am glad that a Minister of State with responsibility for agriculture is in the Chamber because I would like clarification on those people who buy that dairy calf. Will they get money as well? My understanding at the moment is that the person who breeds and rears the calf will get it. This works like a marriage; it works both ways. We need to make sure we incentivise people to do it."

                "I welcome the opportunity to speak on budget 2025 in respect of my Department. It is the first time the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment's budget has gone over the €1 billion mark, which is a significant increase on the previous year in terms of core expenditure.",
                "We have a number of initiatives in the context of this budget to support families and businesses right across the country. We are very clear in terms of our support for the hospitality and retail sectors.",
                "I am very much aware of their vulnerability and the context in which they have been operating, particularly in recent years with the increased regulatory environment and the associated costs. That is why we are responding this year with a €170 million power-up grant to assist them with costs, representing a €4,000 cash payment into each business’s bank account by year end. We are all aware of how tight margins are, so a business would have to earn a significant turnover to get a grant of that amount. We will do everything we can to ensure the grant is paid before Christmas.",
                "It is important to consider how these costs for businesses have come about. A number of proposals are on my desk, for example, increasing sick pay to seven days, which is required by legislation enacted by the Houses. I have carried out research on this proposal and will make a decision by the year’s end, but I have not pressed ahead with it immediately. I will take it seriously. There is another proposal on sub-minimum rates in the minimum wage. We are aware that three quarters of all minimum wage workers are in the retail and hospitality sectors, which is why I want to be careful with any abolition of sub-minimum rates for those aged 18 years or younger. We are examining an impact assessment of the proposal, as the sector is vulnerable at this time. Auto-enrolment is being pushed out to October. The Government has control of this and can give businesses some leeway. Through Indecon, we are also reviewing increases in the work permit regime. Where the additional costs businesses have faced are concerned, all of the above are key measures we have not continued apace.",
                "Halfway through this year, we introduced a package for family businesses in which we reduced PRSI and increased grant aid. We also tried to assist retail and hospitality businesses in changing their operating models. Such businesses are traditional and not at the cutting edge of tax schemes and they practice a straightforward model. We need to determine how we can change that, for example, through energy efficiency grants. I have examined a number of case studies. A small family deli can save €1,500 per month on utilities by upgrading to LED lights and changing refrigeration units. We have a significant grant to support such businesses on that journey. The best way to give businesses money is not to take it from them in the first place. We are working hard to ensure that as many businesses as possible can access the fund this year. We are also trying to support them in digitalising their operating models and adding to their revenue streams. We have a significant grant to assist them in that regard.",
                "The reductions in PRSI are now stitched into the increase in the minimum wage and will ensure no worker on the minimum wage pays the top rate of employer’s PRSI.",
                "The SME test is now at the heart of Government, ensuring every change in statutory instrument, regulation and primary legislation undergoes a strict test to determine how it impacts on the smallest of businesses in our economy, as it is important we protect them. We are looking to expand this test to the wider public service because I deem this a very important matter. Family businesses are the lifeblood of our economy. They employ 70% of workers and drive much of our communities’ economic activity. We are firmly backing them. We are keeping a close eye on their costs to support them however we can.",
                "I welcome the changes to the capital gains tax in support of the intergenerational transfer of assets, for example, passing on the family business. This is important for businesses. We are asking them to invest in decarbonisation and digitalisation, so where a non-cash transaction like this is concerned, the Government should in no way take money from them. Rather, we should support family businesses in transferring to the next generation. This proposal does just that.",
                "It is good to see the thresholds for VAT registration increase. This is an important measure in supporting our small business sector. I also welcome a number of other measures: the increase in the small benefit exemption from two tranches to five and from €1,000 to €1,500; the increase in the earned income tax credit, thereby supporting self-employment in the economy; and measures for start-up companies. It was interesting to hear some business owners welcoming the model we had in place for start-ups and for companies to scale. This will support many high-value jobs and the money we are spending will yield results.",
                "Since the eve of the pandemic, 400,000 more people are working in the economy. That is 400,000 families with an extra income. Over the next year, we will put 100,000 extra jobs into our economy. The best way to resolve constraints and poverty issues and to give communities and families the best lift possible is to offer high-value and important jobs.",
                "Competitiveness is our greatest challenge. We have moved beyond tax for attracting investment and encouraging our indigenous industry to grow. People now consider investments. What are utilities like and what are the prices of energy, water and wastewater? We have to improve in this regard. We brought a memorandum to the Government to ensure investment in this area. We have a large amount of money to put into our grid - potentially €30 billion to 2050 - to ensure we can get energy around the country, be the best country for attracting investment, continue employment growth with high-value jobs and continue to back business."

I commend the Minister, Deputy Burke, and the officials in our Department on the work they have engaged in with the Department of public expenditure in recent weeks to secure a package worth €1 billion plus for our Department next year.",
                "The Minister has reflected on how far we have come over the course of this Government. It is useful to go back to the beginning. At the very start of Covid, we were paying people not to work and businesses to close down. That inflicted significant damage on our enterprise system and enterprise culture. Just as enterprises recovered and caught their breath, we had the consequences of the illegal invasion of Ukraine on fuel and energy prices and on many other issues. Businesses struggled throughout this period, but they had a Government that backed them. This budget will continue to back them.",
                "Within my digital remit in the Department, we had some significant announcements yesterday. The investment to upgrade the grid will lead to a grid that is AI and quantum computer ready, which will be the new way of doing business, the new basis of enterprise and the new direction for jobs over the course of the next five to ten years. The grid will be powered by renewable energy, including offshore energy. Within our Department, offshore energy will be led through the powering prosperity strategy. There was important news yesterday about the developments at the Port of Cork. These will enable us to begin positioning infrastructure along the south coast and, ultimately, the west coast so that we can harness the value of our waves, in particular in the Atlantic Ocean. By putting the infrastructure in place now and making investments in our skills, we will be able to power our digital revolution through our offshore revolution. Our Department is at the forefront of that.",
                "The Minister has referred to the cost challenge facing business. Every member of the Government is acutely conscious of it. It would have been easy yesterday not to introduce the €170 million package that will get €4,000 to nearly 39,000 businesses between now and Christmas, but the Minister fought hard to get it. It will assist many businesses with their energy bills between now and the end of the year. It will be in addition to the €251 million already paid out under the increased cost of business scheme. All in all, there is a €320 million investment in small business in particular, the majority of which has gone to the retail and hospitality sectors, to assist with the challenge of cost.",
                "We are aware that many of the changes that have been made to support employment and workers, which make sense on their own, have had a cumulative effect on business. This is why the SME test will now apply much more rigorously than it has previously. It is also why an examination of all of the underlying costs within Irish business is under way.",
                "Regarding the digital space, I was honoured to be able to establish the national council on artificial intelligence - the AI council - this year. A sum of €100,000 will go to support its work through next year. I thank all of the council's members for the work they have done already.",
                "We will provide an additional €2.75 million for the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission's new responsibilities under the Digital Services Act, the Digital Markets Act and the Data Governance Act. Due to the Digital Services (Levy) Act 2024, which was introduced with the co-operation of the House, the Department will be able to retain income that was previously spent on our responsibilities under the DSA. Those responsibilities will now be funded by a levy on the digital companies to which the DSA applies. The levy will take effect from 1 January, freeing us up to invest in other areas of our Department.",

We are working across many Departments. As the Ceann Comhairle did earlier this evening at the Kildare event, I acknowledge the work of local enterprise offices. I join him in endorsing the work of Ms Jacqui McNabb, a former colleague of mine in the chambers of commerce movement. The local enterprise offices marked their tenth year this year and I commend them all on the extraordinary work they are doing in supporting small businesses in the country.",

Humans can be breeders, producers or competitors and the competence of each link in the chain determines the overall result, both economically and in-competition.",
                "The RDS runs more than 130 competitions at its flagship event, focusing on developing each of the links in the chain. From foals and lead rein competitors to horses and riders representing their country in the Nation's Cup to the full spectrum of breeds, age groups and equestrian organisations, they are all represented at the Dublin Horse Show. Consequently, the RDS is well placed to identify the shared challenges for the Irish sport horse industry across social, educational, economic, high performance and breeding programs. The serious challenges facing the industry include a the lack of capacity in riding schools currently. There has been a reduction in the number of coaches available to the sporting organisations. There has been deterioration in the standard of riding outside youth high performance programmes. The cost and difficulty in getting insurance for equestrian activities is another challenge.",
                "There is difficulty in finding capable and available individuals to start, produce and train horses. There has been an increase in the proportion of the population who have no direct experience of animals. There is an inability to find or afford competently produced ponies and horses. There is inefficient processing and administration of equine passports. There has been a lack of engagement with Irish sport horse or draught breeders on the development of the breeds and studbooks. There is a lack of strategic development and support for equine facilities",
                "There is a need for the industry to have a service-led organisation to address shared industry challenges, skill gaps and weaknesses in the industry value chain. The industry should have a unified approach, taking input from industry stakeholders and ensuring it reflects the needs of affiliates. Any overarching or umbrella body must provide accountability to the industry, increase stakeholder engagement, use industry resources efficiently and engage stakeholders in strategic planning. Furthermore, it should be answerable to its affiliates, hold an annual general meeting where its executive and directors report to the affiliates and have a board of directors populated by representatives of the affiliate organisations.",
                "The role of the Departments which control the funding of programmes is a necessary part of the governance structure of any such organisation. The Ministers for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media should have one appointment each on its board of directors, with the Northern Ireland Sports Forum taking another. The current structure, therefore, could be viewed as unbalanced.",
                "As the RDS prepares for its 150th Horse Show, we would like to see an efficient passport system that allows breeders to sell their animals, buyers to register as owners and show organisers to determine eligibility for competitions based on studbook rules. We would also like to see investment in coaching to ensure that children are safe and competent to compete, support for a national register of equine therapists, the development of capacity in the riding school sector and support for the high performance affiliates through programme development, along with ensuring that Ireland’s horse culture continues to play a role in the social and educational development of its people.",
                "As I have mentioned, the RDS works with all stakeholders and all of those appearing in the session this evening are resolute in their determination to work together for the betterment of our sports and industry. They are of one mind and are also here to ensure all the other associated affiliates concerns are relayed to the committee. The RDS thanks the committee for this opportunity and looks forward to the questions and input as I defer to my colleague, Mr. Robert Draper, from the Irish Draught Horse Breeders Association."

The Irish Draught Horse Breeders Association, IDHBA, is the largest representative organisation of Irish draught owners, breeders and supporters on the island of Ireland, with members nationwide and affiliate groups internationally in the United Kingdom, Canada, North America, Australia and New Zealand. Aligning with the current increase in the popularity of the breed, the association has expanded to improve representation and raise the profile of the breed. Irish draughts are now competing across all equine disciplines and are competitive to a level that satisfies the needs of a major proportion of the total marketplace. The flexibility of the breed to perform in show classes, eventing, dressage, cross-country, show jumping, endurance riding, riding clubs, return to riding and more has driven the breed's recent growth in popularity.",
                "The Irish draught is a foundation breed of the Irish sport horse and is currently classified as a rare breed. The breed has evolved incredibly through the centuries to meet current market needs and this, coupled with the fantastic temperament and soundness that the breed is known and loved for, has resulted in a fantastic product and is one of our few truly Irish horse breeds left.",
                "The IDHBA has nominated a member to the new HSI structure. It has found the level of engagement and the process deficient due to the fact that it does not facilitate a structured, proportional, fair and transparent representation of the industry. The idea of the forum should be to create a basis of understanding the needs of the sector and to allow it to formulate strategy, policies and initiatives to support and develop the entire sector for the betterment of all.",
                "Immediate concerns include the setting of policy and what industry and sector qualifications, references or experience those involved actually hold. Our concerns and basic requirements include: structured, proportional, fair and transparent representation within the equine industry; clear and transparent funding and financial accountability; improved transactional performance and relationships; consultation and involvement in strategy and strategic direction for the Irish draught breed; accurate, compliant and efficient maintenance and management of the Irish draught studbook against the tender awarded; efficient, compliant and transparent maintenance and management of the passport system; and improved equine traceability and efficient access to breed and industry data.",

                "The Equestrian Competition Venues Owners Alliance, ECVOA, is the representative organisation of 18 of the busiest equestrian competition venues in Ireland. Formed in 2017 to address issues affecting the industry, it is the voice of the centres which host the vast majority of all equestrian activities held annually in the 32 counties. The equestrian venues which ECVOA represents are, in the main, family-owned businesses which have been developed and grown, at their own expense, by these families.",
                "With proper investment, ECVOA believes that the sports horse industry can continue to grow and contribute meaningfully to the State. The concerns raised by members are that the sector and industry are being threatened, in part, by an unwillingness by the appointed body to interact in regard to the real day-to-day issues being faced by the sector. Similar to the RDS, from whom members have already heard, all ECVOA members, together with other venues, work with all sector and industry stakeholders and, as such, we believe all have a connected vision of the threats to and solutions for the industry. Venues work with most of the breeding societies and organisations to showcase the breeds through shows, inspections and events, and also provide to HSI the medium for stallion, mare and young stock inspections.",
                "The sporting and leisure affiliate organisations also utilise the vast majority of venues. While it is fair to say that the venues derive an income from these activities, it is also important to recognise the significant and continuous investment required by venues to ensure a facility is retained at a suitable and safe standard. At our previous appearance before the committee, many members were well disposed to progressing a funding model similar to that within HRI, whereby venues supporting the sector could apply for funding where they were not eligible to apply for sports capital grants. This would be a significant move to assist in the improvement and development of facilities that would have an uplift effect on the entire sector. It would also assist in balancing the situation whereby a club with facilities can apply for sports capital grants which allow it to, in effect, gain a State-sponsored advantage over a private entity. The sports capital grants provided to these clubs are essential and should continue, but some balancing will alleviate the threat that venues may be lost or unable to meet the required standards due to investment pressures.",
                "The situation relating to insurance and rates is also very serious. Whilst we accept that they are a necessary evil, we have been deprived of any real form of official representation due to the fact that HSI, as the recognised body, has failed to progress the matter with the relevant Departments and councils despite repeated efforts.",
                "Insurance was again highlighted this past weekend in circumstances where Coillte has moved to prevent access for horse riders. While we see again HSI being placed on various bodies, we see little in the way of a successful outcome that will ensure the sustainability of the sector if those involved in the leisure and tourism aspect of the sector are prevented from developing it. This has a serious and cumulative effect on the production and breeding aspect of the entire sector. Like the other witnesses, we are of the view that change is needed urgently and that the direction of travel being adopted by HSI is not beneficial to the sport, the industry and the sector. We are accompanied today by members of the main sporting affiliates, both as officially invited organisations and those who with us as part of our delegations, namely Para Equestrian Ireland, PEI, and Dressage Ireland. We are anxious to discuss with the committee the needs of the sector and how it envisages being able to assist.",

                "When we came before the committee on 20 September 2023, we left hoping that the follow-on would be that we might see moves that would help in recognising the real needs of the sport, the industry, the sector and, most importantly, the stakeholders and members. To say that we were disappointed is an understatement. The organisations before the committee earlier have already highlighted some of their concerns and we concur with them fully.",
                "We are gravely concerned that the situation which we discussed with the committee last year between HSI and the main sporting affiliates has deteriorated even further. Despite meetings held in October and November with the board of HSI and the sporting affiliates at which frank statements and opinions were aired relating to HSI's direction and management, it would appear that the concerns and reservations relayed were in the main ignored.",
                "The threat that revealed itself was, in fact, the new constitution of HSI that was adopted by the interim, partially populated board of the latter without any consultation with the affiliates and stakeholders. This, together with the refusal of the board to reinstate the councils and council-appointed directors, was in clear violation of the previous constitution of HSI. Furthermore, it would appear that Sport Ireland officials attending a meeting of HSI and the HP affiliates and stakeholders were unable to confirm that they had been consulted as required under the Sport Ireland governance code which fundamentally change the direction and status of HSI.",
                "HSI has continued to move further away from any form of real consultation or accountability. This is not something that any member-based organisation that is accountable to its membership can endorse. As such, those organisations may be forced to adopt a different and more suitable and accountable direction.",
                "Showjumping Ireland is aware that statements made by HSI to this committee relating to funding are factually inaccurate. Showjumping Ireland corresponded with HSI post the November meeting and in the aftermath of the correspondence sent to this committee by HSI following the meeting on 20 September. To date, HSI has not provided the detail requested to verify the claims it made.",
                "Eight submissions that did not agree with the direction being adopted were published but were not adopted. It has been stated by HSI that other submissions were received which agreed with its direction, but it will not publish these. Is this credible or acceptable? Showjumping Ireland represents to the committee that its fellow HP affiliates have similar concerns and have requested that we make the committee aware of this. Those are PEI, Dressage Ireland and Eventing Ireland.",
                "Showjumping Ireland still stands willing to fund international competition but this must be structured and carried out in a transparent and acceptable manner. HSI has declined to enter this process despite Showjumping Ireland outlining this to Mr. Paul McDermott of Sport Ireland at a meeting of affiliates and HSI. Mr. McDermott did not indicate any issue from his perspective as a Sport Ireland official where a budget submission could be made to the affiliate for funding toward HP activities. HSI stated at this meeting that it would not make a submission and appeared to take umbrage at the phrase. The committee should note that this committee was misinformed by HSI on 15 November 2023 in relation to the funding mechanism by Showjumping Ireland and has yet to correct the record as requested. We would like to discuss in detail with the committee the statements made on 15 November 2023 relating to HP funding.",
                "Showjumping Ireland and other HP affiliates provided direct assistance to youth and senior squads in 2023 and 2024 on foot of no direct support being provided by HSI in certain instances. Serious issues were identified in the HP funding model and use of same during the meeting between HSI, Sport Ireland and the HP affiliates. The purpose of this meeting was to work with all stakeholders to gain better return from funding and ensure athletes receive better supports. All HP affiliates share the same concerns relating to this area and transparency and accountability and have signalled this to HSI and continue to do so.",
                "As the committee will be aware, many sporting affiliates have had members who are disadvantaged due to the current and previous delays with passports. This related to unacceptable delays in simple areas, such as change of ownership. This means that the member cannot register the animal and thus may not be able to compete the animal, sell the animal, etc. They are not able to transport as they no longer retain the passport in their possession. What excuse can be given for such inefficiency that causes significant issues for the industry. The delays in passport activities were cited by HSI as being due to a decision by the Department of agriculture and this was relayed directly to this committee and Deputy Fitzmaurice. Can the committee confirm if inquiries were made relating to this statement, and if this was the case?",
                "Showjumping Ireland had almost 200,000 competition rounds jumped in 2023. That number will increase in 2024. This shows the level of activity within showjumping alone, and other affiliates will have figures relative to their own activities. Every horse jumping these rounds should have its passport present with it and the committee will appreciate it is not acceptable that an issuing entity cannot ensure a service to assist members and stakeholders comply with the law.",
                "As sporting bodies, we maintain large databases. Events earlier this year shocked the country due to the investigations by RTÉ. This had a direct impact on the affiliates and the reputation of the industry. HSI has not interacted with the affiliate bodies to date to work with them to address or ensure that affiliates are aware of any measures been undertaken by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to prevent any recurrence. Few visible actions have been undertaken to address the damage to the integrity and reputation of the sector.",
                "Showjumping Ireland, like the other HP affiliates, was disappointed with the changes to the constitution of HSI. Based on the dates that they were formulated, proposed and lodged with CRO, it might even be suspected that the changes were being adopted during the period when the board of HSI was meeting the affiliates and yet chose not to discuss the significant changes being made. The interim board had adopted a new constitution before it sought to have a meeting with the affiliates. Affiliates were invited to a briefing to tell them what had been done, not to discuss with them what was being considered.",
                "Further to this, the affiliates have been advised that it could be challenged. We have seen a number of instances where HSI has attempted to undermine and damage the governance of the sector and sport. These actions have jeopardised state funding to the sector from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and further heightened the concerns of the affiliates. Again, we would like to discuss them in detail with the committee. The affiliates continue to face issues relating to actions taken or decisions made by HSI where they are taken without reference to the responsible bodies. This again undermines trust and shows a disrespect toward those involved in the sector.",
                "The years 2023 and 2024 have been extremely successful for equestrian sport in general. While we were all disappointed that we did not win medals in Paris, we were also very proud of the performances of our athletes and horses. Our youth squads across all disciplines are the envy of the world and bring championship medals home year after year. This success is born out of the foundation put in place by the national affiliates and their associated partners, venues, shows, coaches, trainers, parents, owners and breeders. A significant problem is the lack of join-up and continuity of management of the programme. It concerns affiliates that this is a hindrance to the proper development and support of the sport and industry.",
                "The affiliate bodies have looked at this situation clinically and the evidence suggests that the current entity is unable to develop and gain the necessary financial resources to support the administrative and coaching programmes to ensure the success of the sector and sport.",
                "There is an absolute need for this committee to meet with the Irish Horse Board, which has been granted the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's marketing tender.",
                "SJI has invested heavily in its online systems and they are now acknowledged as being hugely important to the worldwide market. The systems are free to use and had in excess of 200 million visits in the last 16 months alone. This markets the entire sector to a worldwide audience. EI and DI also maintain competition databases which are all the main drivers, together with competition venues and shows, in ensuring buyers look to Ireland to source horses. It is essential there is joined-up thinking in this area. This committee may be able to work with the Irish Horse Board and all stakeholders to identify any areas within their tender requirements that could hamper providing the actual support to the sector.",

Anecdotally, I am being told by staff in Horse Sport Ireland and also people trying to access passports that there has been a complete breakdown in delivery this year. I think that is borne out by everything that has been said today. HSI got €600,000 in Brexit funding to implement a new passport strategy. We are able to deliver 1 million passports for humans in a year in a much more challenging environment, one in which identification is checked across borders and continents, yet we cannot issue passports for foals in a timely manner.",

The market is breaking down. We already see a fallback in the sales and value of young stock this year. We will go into it in more detail but I am extremely disappointed that the Department has not sat up and taken notice of what this committee is saying about Horse Sport Ireland.

In particular, there were statements made that Showjumping Ireland collects a levy on behalf of Horse Sport Ireland for international affairs and it was not paying the moneys collected by it to be given to international affairs. The correction is that since 2010, I believe, Showjumping Ireland has given round-figure amounts towards international participation. It has not collected a levy since the times of the Equestrian Federation of Ireland, EFI. Moneys are collected into SJI for the administration of its sport and the support of its activities. From that, its management, finance committees and board make a decision as to the level of support provided to international affairs. That was done for a three-year period with an agreement in place where books were opened and accounts and plans prepared, and that worked very well. At the end of that three-year agreement, no follow-on agreement was put in place. It was very ad hoc and very much a case of \"How much can you give?\". In the last number of years, SJI sought to regularise that again and to have a situation where plans would be put forward and could be costed properly. There was a degree of resistance to that. We just could not get agreement that they would be submitted for Showjumping Ireland. As I think some of the others here will confirm, we intended to increase the amount of funding to international participation but it was conditional on submissions being made, so we could have a proper budget and structure to return to the members and justify any increase in funding."

In listening to some of the comments and in reply to Deputy Flaherty about where we are with the threats, we have to realise that HSI is not fit for purpose. With the changes Mr. Corrigan alluded to, it is effectively a private company with no accountability to the industry or to the funders of the industry. The recent changes in its constitution have focused on HSI's needs, not the industry's requirements. One would have to say that HSI has altered the constitution to neutralise the high-performance part of our industry and the representation at a board level and other levels. It has, in a sense, just played along with the system and given succour to the requirement to engage. There has been no engagement with the industry. Self-preservation seems to dominate its thinking when it declares that it is the legitimate authority and sole arbiter over our industry. That is contained in its new constitution. It makes a mockery of everybody else in the private sector that another private company can come along and claim jurisdiction over it. They have isolated and insulated themselves from the industry and the high-performance sector. It is a significant cause for concern. They do not possess the expertise. Most of us have been in the industry for a lifetime or for generations and we would not claim to have the expertise. However, we have career administrators who are now dictating to the industry what direction it should take and how it should go. They are very serious threats to the industry at this stage because all the Government funding, be it from the Department of agriculture or the Department of sport, is being channelled through HSI. It is a big risk for everybody else in the industry when the administration of that has been done in this fashion."

A lot of things have been said here. People listening in from the outside to what has been said - I want to draw particular reference to Mr. Corrigan - would think this is a toxic relationship. It is actually a very sad state of affairs for those who are hugely interested in and committed to this sector to be watching this debate. We must remember that the public are watching too and that this is being webcast. Mr. Corrigan is on the record here, as we all are.",

In terms of the RDS, Mr. Madden has summarised the scenario in two simple pages, and I commend him on that. I have a lot of time for the RDS and the work it does. Of course, we all want to showcase the best of Irish breeding and horses. We all want competition and development in the marketplace of the Irish horse. Mr. Madden set out ten key objectives and I agree with all of them.",

It is a fantastic organisation and I want the witnesses to convey to the board my, and I am sure everyone else's, delight with the professionalism of the RDS and the way it has advocated and advanced. Reading this, I am not sure if the witnesses are here to do a pitch for the RDS to take the job or replace the work, functions and governance of HSI, but we will come to that in a few moments. There would be natural conflicts if the RDS were to express a view. I will pose a few questions on that possible scenario, which I sense from reading the RDS document that it is pitching for. I might be wrong. As I have the opportunity to question the witnesses, they have the opportunity to correct or rebut me.",

HSI is not here today so is at somewhat of a disadvantage. I have no doubt that in a few days its representatives will take time to read the transcript of these meetings. I want to get some context. HSI is the only approved body for doping testing. The RDS this year at the horse show had, I am advised, some 1,400 to 1,500 horses competing. I know about the international federation's roles, functions and obligations and its responsibility for oversight, governance and testing. There is an international dimension to that element of equestrian sport and there is movement across jurisdictions. The RDS will be familiar with the national classes, but it has no jurisdiction in terms of doping there. It might facilitate and assist HSI, which is the only body approved in the country to do doping tests. Are the witnesses in a position to tell the committee how many HSI doping tests took place in the RDS in August in the show?"

                "The Deputy can interrupt me as I go. If we go back a little over two years, a board consisting of nine members was in place. Eight of those positions were filled. The ninth was dedicated to Northern Ireland and that position could not be filled at the time. Of those eight, four were ministerial appointments and the remaining four came from among the affiliates. There were four advisory groups which the affiliates populated. The chair of each of those advisory groups automatically became a director of HSI. In other words, a chair within an advisory group was elected and he or she automatically had a seat on the board.",
                "That was the case up until last November, almost 12 months ago. I may be a few weeks out on that. At that stage, over the space of a week, the then board resigned and the Minister for agriculture appointed four directors as an interim board. When they were appointed, the Minister said it would be until after the Olympics in order to provide stability.",
                "So the board consisted of four, all ministerial appointments. A quorum of three was required for a board to meet. One of its jobs was to devise a new board structure. That new board structure, which they recommended, was for nine people. Again, four direct ministerial appointments. The fifth person was to be from the Northern Ireland Sports Forum, which I think is the correct title. The remaining four would go back again into the constituent groups but with one difference. Each of these advisory groups, that previously their chair was automatically a board member, were now asked to nominate two people who would then be interviewed \"for consideration\" for appointment as a director, so no guarantee any longer. If the two people who were interviewed were not considered suitable then the appointment would go back to the Minister. So in theory, under the new system, the Minister appoints four people to start, a fifth is appointed by the Northern Ireland Sports Forum and the remaining four, who would come from those four advisory fora, would nominate two people each, and if they were considered they would be appointed."

If any director during their term has to resign, for whatever reason or if they are deceased, their replacement will be appointed by the Minister. So it is possible on two fronts, from an affiliate point of view, that the affiliates will have no voice on the board. It is a bit like, for example, a Deputy going for an election in a couple of weeks or months and the top two people who are elected are suddenly called in for an interview and an external person will deem whether they are suitable or not to take up a seat. That is the concern of affiliates - that the voice may not be heard."

At that meeting I put forward very much the view, which I am quite happy to share here again with the committee, that the board does need to be represented by people directly elected by affiliates. At that meeting they shared a concern about gender balance. We brought that back to RDS and discussed it. We invited affiliates in and we openly discussed the matter. To the best of my knowledge, all of the affiliates were invited. Many came and we discussed it. At the conclusion of one of those meetings we recommended that there would be a board of seven members. One from each of the four advisory groups whoever their chairs where. Then, from a gender balance point of view, the Minister had two remaining places, and the seventh would be from Northern Ireland. So for gender balance to be addressed, we felt that the Minister could address that as opposed to initially he appointing and the affiliates having to address the matter. That was a positive, constructive suggestion which we made. That four would be directly voted upon and appointed by the affiliates, two from the Minister and one from Northern Ireland.",

Crucially, funding is controlled by the Department so whoever controls the purse strings can control many things. Accountability is there through the Department. We believe accountability is huge here but the policy or strategy could be driven by those within and from the affiliates, within the industry."

                "We were the first ones to start looking at this, and we asked that question collectively when affiliates attended a meeting with HSI. When the board resigned, the Minister was perfectly entitled to make his appointments. Within the old pre-January 2024 constitution of HSI, it stated that where the directors representing the councils have resigned, it is incumbent on the remainder of the board to ensure the councils meet to appoint a new director to replace them. I referenced that in our statement. When we met this committee last year, our understanding leaving the room was that the interim board of HSI would facilitate that. The councils would reform and be taken out of abeyance, which they were put into. They would appoint new chairpersons, those chairpersons would then take their seats on the board, and if there were a change to be made for whatever purpose at least the industry would be involved in it and have buy-in because those directors were reporting directly back to the councils, which were populated by the affiliates. Everybody was happy that would work. What happened was the interim board ignored what we had asked it. We also asked it directly to do that in October last year when we sat in a meeting in the HSI board room. We asked for that same thing to be done. What happened instead was the interim board held an AGM. It had a quorum, so it was entitled to hold an AGM, but it devised and adopted a brand-new constitution. That constitution did not have the input of directors' representatives from the councils that were written into the old constitution, and which were populated by the affiliates. I would not like to say anyone acted illegally, but we have a scenario where good faith was certainly not being used, in that the industry was left aside from having insider involvement in the rewriting of a constitution that was going to affect the industry. That is one of the fundamental problems. The constitution now has written out the councils, written out the make-up of the councils, written out the direct representation as to how a chairperson or whoever comes forward to it, so it has taken away the need to have what they now call the forums. The forums can be changed by the board within its own constitution. That is clear when you read the new constitution of HSI. It is a limited company, but it is predominantly funded by the State. It has some commercial elements within it, but it is funded by the State. Where affiliates, as they were, have concerns is that we now have an entity in which they have a limited input, that can decide to carry out actions that could have serious impacts on those affiliates and that it is endowed with a title which is the national governing body for high-performance sport. When that title was endowed to it circa 2006 under the Dowling report it was with the buy-in of the then affiliates and the handing over that title from the old EFI. The EFI gave it on the basis that, at the time, the affiliates had direct representation onto the board. They had people sitting directly on the board to look after sporting industry interests. It was a big board, and I am not saying it was perfect. It changed under the Indecon review. The affiliates still lived with it. They were quite happy with it, but this constitution has been changed without any consultation with the industry similar to that which took place as part of the Indecon review. They were not deeply involved in the changes that have been made. Mr. Byrne alluded to it. He was invited to become a member of something into which he had no input and no knowledge of how it was going to function."

We are all scrambling around in the market hoping we can get an underwriter to take on our risk whether it is showjumping, eventing, dressage, para-equestrian, horse board activities or RDS activities. The venues also have to have their own insurance. Again, to a degree we are all having to paddle our own canoes. There is no industry-led structured approach to how we can get better insurance to cover all of us, to mitigate risk and work with the insurance underwriters. There probably are not any Irish-based underwriters taking this at all. There is a minimum number of underwriters through Lloyd’s that will take up this risk. Our problem is that we are being left with no real lead on this. To be honest, I do not think the expertise is there to have it. However, we are in a vacuum, as someone referred to it earlier. We have a body we are supposed to recognise as an industry umbrella body, which was set up as a body to support and enhance how we do things, but when the really important things happen, we are left to do it ourselves.",
                "Senator Boyhan asked about anti-dope testing. From the showjumping perspective we can speak authoritatively on this because we are the only affiliate doing a significant amount of testing and we do it in consultation and partnership with HSI, which is the Sport Ireland-nominated body to carry out that testing. However, HSI's role is that for every euro the affiliate provides towards funding it will use Sport Ireland funding - euro for euro. That is how it is funded. HSI will make the decision on the vet and appoint the vet. HSI will make the decision on the testing laboratory, whether it is in France or the equine centre. It will make the decision on that. It will also predominantly make the decision on the number of tests carried out at each event. The process for selection of animals, riders, or whatever, to be tested at an event is done in consultation with the senior officials from the affiliate on the day, as per its rules and regulations so if there is a positive test it stands up if challenged or taken to court. That is why the affiliate must have a structure that suits its activities. It is not a case that HSI can test at a draught show should it wish to do so at the RDS, at eventing, dressage or whatever it may be. However, in the instance it is testing at an event, it needs the expertise of the officials trained by the affiliates to be specifically competent in carrying out their roles. That is the difference. HSI does not carry out that role."

We try to be solution driven. The witnesses' dedication to their sector and desire to see it sustained and advanced is obvious this evening. I fear that with all that is going on and if things are as bad on the ground as they appear to be, we will start to lose some of our better high-performance people. Mr. McCartan, in answering Deputy Flaherty, referred to sports capital, the great work his organisation is doing and how it cannot get funding as it is private. If we had the money he is lobbying for at our disposal, to what body would we give it to be confident it would go where Mr. McCartan highlighted it is needed? Under the current structure, even if the money were abundant, we would not know where to go to ensure it would get to where it was needed. In this regard, let us consider the HRI model for capital development grants, whereby it pays out to its affiliates. As Mr. McCartan's organisation is private, it cannot get sports capital. I see exactly where it is caught but I also see the conundrum associated with the question of who we would give the money to if we had it this evening. What structure would he like to see that would allow him to know that, when we hand the money to someone, it will eventually get to where it is so badly needed or is requested for?"

The formulation of that board following the Dowling report was such that it had representatives from other stakeholders across the industry – all the affiliates. For example, Showjumping Ireland had four members on the board, Eventing Ireland had two and Dressage Ireland had one. I believe the Irish Horse Board had four. The number depended on the size of the affiliated organisation. If I recollect correctly, there were 17 people on the board. Mr. Beecher was one of the chairs. The first chair we had was Joe Walsh. He was the man who set the whole thing up. He was the Government-appointed chairman of the original board.",
                "The Indecon report examined the organisation and suggested that the size of the board be reduced to increase efficiency. There was a huge amount of discussion on this. The memorandums, articles and constitution lodged with the authority at the time set out the structures for the pre-January 2024 Horse Sport Ireland. That was what was alluded to by Mr. Madden. There were four Government appointees on the body, and the advisory councils. I was part of the original board of HSI. It was turkeys voting for Christmas in that each of the affiliates and organisations, following considerable discussion and interaction, agreed the best way forward for the governing body was to reduce the size of the board. In the constitution, and as alluded to, each organisation was allotted a certain number of places. I am here as a representative of the RDS and I am the CEO of the equitation school. The school had a seat on the high-performance advisory council and the coaching and education advisory council. The RDS had a seat on the high-performance advisory council and also on the coaching and education advisory council. Showjumping Ireland had the original chairmanship. Each of the affiliates and organisations was guaranteed a pathway through to board membership. I was one of the directors along with two of the Government-appointed directors who opted to resign back in November 2022. We did so because we were not satisfied with the direction HSI was taking.",
                "What happened when the rest of the board resigned was the Government appointees came in. They suspended the advisory councils. In effect, they prevented the stakeholders and affiliates from sending forward their representatives to make the decision on what the new memorandum would be. The crux of why we are here today is the new memorandums and articles that are now registered prevent guaranteed stakeholder engagement. That is the process that has led us to where we are now. The original structure, in my opinion, was fit for purpose and did a lot of very good work when there was significant stakeholder involvement. For sure, there was a breakdown in the structures at one stage. The proposal whereby the main funding partners, namely, the Departments of agriculture and sport, would also sit on the board and represent those main funding partners is a way forward. The simple answer to the question is stakeholder involvement in decision-making and policy. The organisation and direction of the umbrella organisation is what is required. Currently, there is no guaranteed structure that will allow that to happen."

I see no reason funds could not be directed towards the equine industry through the rural development programme and ring-fenced towards specific infrastructural development. Such companies have all the mechanisms, they understand corporate governance and they are well used to being audited by third-party organisations. If that were done in the interim to get funding rolling into the industry, when HSI's future is rectified, then maybe funding could be channelled through it on a similar basis as rural development. We should not be devoid of investment or an opportunity for capital development simply on the basis that there is no conduit we have confidence in."

We have the finest horse riders in the country and we have the finest horses. Other countries such as Great Britain and Germany have horses that bred in Ireland and they win gold medals.

When I was Minister of State with responsibility for sport, I could not appoint the chairman without going to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the board could not be appointed without coming to me. That is what goes on at Department level.",

Why are we not doing something about it? I ask whoever wants to respond on what we must do from today to try and correct what is wrong."

                "It is refreshing to hear the Deputy. He hit the nail on the head. As we have said over and over, our biggest concern has been that the new constitution of HSI 2024 is designed to effectively protect HSI's existence. It is not accountable to the affiliates. It is accountable to its own members. The only members it has are its board, so it is, effectively, accountable to itself.",
                "How do we fix it? We need the committee to help us to put something in place that will serve the sports and the industry, because they all link together. We all link together. The Deputy mentioned the two Ministries being in a power struggle. It is a constant thing. The Deputy perceives us to be in a power struggle with HSI. We are not in a power struggle with it. I will be frank in how I say it; we are trying to give HSI a kick in the ass to realise we want to look after our sport and our industry. We are all passionate about it. A lot of us make our living out of it. We have our families involved for generations. We are not going to harm this industry but we are going to fight tooth and nail to support it and grow it.",
                "When HSI came into existence, it was a terrific idea. It was an umbrella body that was going to find funding to fund sport and breeding and grow both so that they would come together. It definitely did that for a while but, unfortunately, it started to deviate because the thing that was bringing them together took on a life of its own and it forgot what it was meant to do. That is still the case. There is no use in talking about reversing it. We have done that. We spent last year talking about that. We have given it a year. Reversing it is not going to work. This thing needs a mallet to land on top of it. The industry needs to be supported and recognised. Most importantly, it needs to be listened to properly, not just to let it talk and then leave the room and do whatever you want to do yourself. HSI needs to listen to the industry, as the Deputy alluded to - the people who know exactly what is going on. Mr. Madden referenced it. I know this first-hand because my wife works with Riding for the Disabled Ireland, and therapy with children and horses. She will tell first-hand that there is nothing better than to see a little child, or in some instances adults who have disabilities, come out of themselves for that one hour they get. The centres are run predominantly by volunteers who give up their time freely and get very little assistance from the big bodies.",
                "We are obsessed with the Olympics, and rightly so. Medals bring us success and pride to the country. One feeds off the other. That is really important to see. We cannot have a board, whether it be nine or 17 people, who forget about that. That is the reality of it. They forget about the venues that put their facilities in place, the ECVOA venues, that spent hundreds of thousands on their venues so they are safe and suitable to help therapy children and to teach children how to ride so they are in a situation to deal with what the Deputy looked for, for example, the child who needs somewhere to put their pony because it will give them an outlet instead of hanging around on a corner somewhere or getting into mischief. That is what we all work to do. The RDS is a foundation based on helping, supporting and doing those things. Showjumping Ireland does the very same thing. Our safeguarding policies, support policies and our training policies are all based on finding that child who is eight years of age, and we bring them all the way through to jumping in the Dublin Horse Show. Jumping in Dublin is the pinnacle for them nationally, and the RDS helps us every year in doing that. We plough our resources into it.",
                "We want to join the 12.2 child up to the ones the Deputy wants to see lifting the Olympic medal. We cannot do that if the whole thing is not joined up and if they do not recognise each other’s strengths. We currently have a situation where there is an entity and there is, not a power struggle, but a distrust between the organisations, that we will do so much work and then it is taken away and you have no input into it anymore. However, when it fails or does not deliver what people expect it to deliver, who takes the flack for it? It is the people nationally, because they have lost interest in it. The sponsorship then disappears. The corporate support and the national systems disappear. That is what happens to us. We end up ploughing resources into rebuilding that for the for the next four years, and then the same thing happens.",
                "We need it joined up. We need all committee members to drop that mallet on the table and say enough is enough, it is time to sit up, that you do not care how important you think you are, you are getting in a room and listening to these people. That is what we need, and it is all we want them to do. It is not about personalities or the people on the board all the time. I am sure they are very competent people. They were very able and capable civil servants in their Departments. However, the Deputy is right. Some of them have very little practical knowledge of what is wanted and that has to change. Put the people who have the best interests of the sport and the industry in places where they can influence and develop and do things properly. That is all we want, as well as transparency.",
                "Transparency is the most important thing. If State funding is coming into this, every single person should be able to see a set of accounts that shows what the last penny was spent on. We have to do it for our organisations. We sit in front of them. We would be quite happy to give our accounts to members and they could go through them and see exactly what we spend our money on. Can the Deputy say they have the same thing from an entity that is in receipt of a large amount of State funding? We can and will do that. Can everyone else within the sector do that?"

I know high performance is there and it is supposed to be equally distributed. Some organisations get a massive amount of high performance money and they are still high performance. They have not done much good in the past 20 years. Some people are not living in Ireland but use the nationality and country, and get good high performance money. They do not perform when they go to the Olympics but that is not about performance. I would like to see a bit more funding going into the sport. The first thing that has to be done, as Mr. Corrigan said, is people have to be brought together. Somebody has to take the hammer and somebody has to take control. They have to listen to the industry and the industry has to respond. That is all I have to say."

Why are we so different? That is what I am looking at. Why are we so different? We are a smaller industry but we are actually spread wider because we have ponies, horses and children. Racing does not have that. It has breeding and competition. We have that. It has a board that is broad but it has direct input from people who are very knowledgeable in the industry and actually represent sectors of the industry. The bookmakers, trainers and stable staff are all sitting on the board, which means they are accountable to the people on the ground. They are also accountable to the Minister, which is correct, and to the taxpayer. They are accountable and answerable to the people on the ground. If you have a problem, you will be darn sure that, for example, if there is a message the bookies needs to get across, Daragh Fitzpatrick as the bookies’ representative on the board of HRI gets it across. The trainers, the stable staff – they are all the there. Then what have we got? We have HRI, which works with the IHRB, which is the rules committee. It works with Irish Thoroughbred Marketing. They all work together because they all recognise the specialist expertise each person has. That is what we are missing. There are competent and very good people there. Unfortunately, those people, based on the creature they have now in their constitution, are actually not able to use all the people who are sitting here, and I can refer to other high-performance affiliates who are sitting at home and are probably watching us.

I was a member of the 17-person board and it was a slow-moving organisation to be fair. It was a very steady ship. The members supported each other and there was great support for para equestrian, defence and the Army Equitation School. We all looked after each other but maybe we were not as fluid as we needed to be. This was the reason for moving to the advisory forum methodology. I still believe it could be a good way, with the improvement of bringing in the major funding partners of agriculture and sport to be involved on the board. It would be better than what we have now because for sure we need stakeholder involvement. They need to be listened to and to be part of the decision-making process.

I ask Deputy Kehoe to forgive me because I know he wants a quick answer. Senator Boyhan indicated that he wanted to be devil's advocate and certainly did so in his own inimitable way. I ask Deputy Kehoe to allow me to do the same. At that board meeting, my opening comment was that the difficulty with the board was not the board. The people present were the board and the executive. I challenged the executive at that meeting to the effect that it was not fit for purpose. It was the problem prior to the new board and it remains the problem. It is still the problem today.

I want to tease the matter out a bit more. During the four or five days of the showjumping event at the RDS, what is the process with HSI regarding drug testing? Can it not just walk in and say it wants to test horse A, B, C and D in this class and in the 3 p.m. tomorrow class it wants to test horse A, B, C and D, and so on over the course of the event? Why does it have to go to the RDS? Why does the RDS have to prearrange that it is only allowed to test this class, that class or whatever? At an all-Ireland final or any intercounty fixture, doctors can walk into the dressing room and say they want to test this, that or the other player. They can be held up for another two hours depending on a urine sample or whatever it is. Why is it not the same at the RDS?"

For level 2, the national level, it has been more than five years since the most recent course. For level 3, the international level, the most recent course was in 2015. I will speak more about level 1, the assistant coach level. I stand to be corrected, but I think the cost of that course used to be approximately €300. More recently, it has gone up to €3,200 or €3,300, which is a 1000% increase. Let us focus on that for a moment. Level 1 coaches tend to be the younger people who we need to come into our industry. Teagasc enters an international competition for young breeders and Ireland won the world championship a couple of years ago. Many of those young people, under the age of 23 or 24, had planned to do the level 1 course before the 1000% increase in the cost. That plan evaporated. Coaching is the big request here. If we do not coach, people are not going to come into our schools and we are not going to be able to get our riders up to a good level. We are not going to be able to get people to produce horses at a high enough level. Coaching is the big request.",

There is a great deal of money in the industry and much of it will flow into it if we are all joined up. That is the reality. Deputy Ring asked a question about our Olympic teams. We look at the Olympic teams of other nations and at the Irish soccer team and the corporate sponsorship they have. They are supported by corporates. Our international showjumping squads get a pittance because it is not joined up from the start to the finish. The people who can join it up are sitting before the committee, as are their fellow affiliates. I would ask the Minister to sit down and have an open meeting where everything is up for discussion and we could be walking out of the door with a lovely clean sheet of paper and thinking we can start again. Lieutenant Colonel Freyne mentioned it. I was on the first board. Mr. Joe Walsh used to say, every time he met us, \"A rising tide lifts all boats.\" He was very good at getting us all to co-operate with each other. I agree with Lieutenant Colonel Freyne that there were too many people on that board and Showjumping Ireland was part of that problem because we had four representatives on the board. We would have been quite happy and could have managed quite well if we had two representatives on the board. If every organisation lost a couple of members, we would have had a board of 12 or 14 people that would have done a job. As is the case at the committee, everybody gets in a room, learns about each other's problems and concerns and comes up with solutions. The executive is then told to make it happen. That is what I would like."

                "On behalf of the Neurological Alliance of Ireland, the national umbrella for more than 30 neurological charities throughout Ireland, I thank the Chair and members of the committee for the joint invitation to the NAI and MS Ireland, together with NAI members, An Saol Foundation, to discuss Ireland’s response to the rehabilitation needs of people living with neurological conditions in the context of the commitment to rehabilitation as a right under Article 26 of the UNCRPD.",
                "Neurorehabilitation refers to the treatment provided to individuals after experiencing a neurological injury, illness or diagnosis of a neurological condition. This description, however, does not adequately convey the fundamental hope and potential that neurorehabilitation gives to people with neurological conditions. It can be the difference that enables people to return to employment, live independently, retain or recover the ability to do everyday tasks and live a full life after a neurological diagnosis. Unfortunately in Ireland, access to neurorehabilitation can be a lottery. Neurorehabilitation services are not available equally across the country. Many parts of Ireland remain significantly underserved with neurorehabilitation services, and the findings of a HSE report on inpatient rehabilitation published just last week further highlights the stark gaps in neurorehabilitation services.",
                "Article 26 of the UNCRPD is about putting people living with a disability at the centre of their rehabilitative and habilitative care. It means offering a choice to prevent crises and to support people living with a disability in the way they want to be supported.",
                "The gold standard of this implementation is already being put in place by our voluntary sector providers through the 2019 neurorehabilitation strategy commitment to develop long-term neurorehabilitation services in the community. As an example, services provided by NAI member MS Ireland include community worker services, wellness and symptom management programmes, exercise and physiotherapy programmes open to people with a range of neurological conditions, and respite care through the MS Care Centre. We will highlight many other examples throughout our presentation where NAI member organisations, including our members An Saol Foundation, which is present, are providing critical services in line with the long-term needs identified in the neurorehabilitation strategy in a range of areas such as residential care, vocational rehabilitation, day services and family and carer supports.",
                "The well-publicised challenges facing section 39 voluntary providers including funding shortfalls, staff recruitment and retention difficulties, and the increasing cost of delivering services, represent a serious ongoing threat to the continuation of these services. Much more needs to be done to properly invest in, sustain and develop these vital community supports in order that they are available to everyone who needs them. The National Strategy and Policy for the Provision of Neuro-Rehabilitation: Implementation Framework 2019 to 2021 focused on three key deliverables. They are the development of community neurorehabilitation teams, the delivery of long-term community neurorehabilitation services and the development of inpatient neurorehabilitation services.",
                "There is no doubt that welcome progress has been made in recent years in delivering on some aspects of the strategy. In particular, the Minister of State with responsibility for disability, Deputy Rabbitte, has invested significantly in the roll-out of community neurorehabilitation teams in line with the programme for Government commitment to implement the neurorehabilitation strategy. She has, in addition, commissioned pioneering research to understand the challenges facing service users and service providers in accessing and delivering neurorehabilitation services in the community. This neuromapping project, a joint collaboration between the NAI, Disability Federation Ireland and the HSE, will issue a report to be launched by the Minister in the coming weeks.",
                "It is clear however that much still remains to be done if Ireland is to meet its obligations to people with neurological conditions under Article 26 through the full implementation of the national neurorehabilitation strategy. The strategy provides a much-needed framework and impetus for developing neurorehabilitation services. We know what needs to be done to make Article 26 a lived reality for people with neurological conditions and their families throughout Ireland. We have acknowledged the meaningful progress that has been made, through the commitment of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and through the work of our fellow members of the national steering group responsible for implementing the neurorehabilitation strategy. It is only by ensuring everyone who needs neurorehabilitation, regardless of age, condition or where they live, gets it that we can meet our obligations under the UNCRPD to the thousands of people throughout Ireland living with a neurological condition.",
                "Our presentation today is focused on the neurorehabilitation needs of adults over 18, the age cohort for the national neurorehabilitation strategy. We are aware that services for children with acquired neurological conditions are, if anything, in even more critical need of development. That issue warrants a discussion beyond the time we have available today, but NAI would be happy to provide support and information to the committee in convening a future meeting given its importance to children and families all across Ireland.",
                "We thank the committee for its interest in the issue of access to neurorehabilitation services and request it to support the NAI and its members in their call for full implementation of the neurorehabilitation strategy, including seeking sustainable provision of the long-term services and supports they provide in the community and ensuring these supports are available to everyone who needs them."

I am accompanied by Mr. Odhrán Ó hUallacháin, senior physiotherapist and interim clinical lead at An Saol Foundation, and Mr. Joe Grogan from Galway, who is a trustee of An Saol Foundation and father of Shane Grogan, who suffered a SABI in an unprovoked attack in 2012 when he was 22 years old. We will be speaking on behalf of a group of people who, because of their injuries, can no longer speak for themselves. They have been left behind as hopeless cases, not curable and not worth the effort, but they have a passion for life, a passion to be active, to seek new experiences and for healthy living. They would rather live. This is why we established An Saol Foundation.",
                "The foundation was inspired by our son Pádraig Schäler who was hit by a truck in 2013 when he was cycling to work on Cape Cod. Nobody was ever prosecuted. An Saol Foundation centre opened its doors in January 2020 for its three-year pilot demonstrator phase. In January 2022, we presented a mid-term review of the pilot demonstrator phase and proposed to the HSE a fully specified and costed implementation phase from 2023 to 2027 with a national centre and country-wide satellite centres. The HSE commissioned a review by three independent international experts who published their report and recommendations in February 2023. This report found that the service was necessary, that it was effectively delivered by An Saol Foundation, that its scope and geography should be expanded and that it could position Ireland internationally as a leader in the delivery of this kind of disability service.",
                "In its Santry centre, An Saol Foundation offers an holistic service for the body, mind and soul of its clients. The total funding for the three-year pilot demonstrator project, which was aimed at three to five families, was €1.5 million.",
                "In 2023, the total running costs were €570,000 for 28 clients, with a current weekly delivery of a total of just over 140 hours - this year it will be 160 hours - by just under five whole-time equivalent, WTE, practitioners and about two WTE support staff. The foundation requested a budget of €880,000 for 2024 to allow it to start implementing some of the recommendations of the 2023 HSE report. It was offered just €600,000 by the HSE, in effect a decrease in funding. To date, the 2024 service arrangement has not been signed as discussions about the budget allocation have been ongoing since May 2023.",
                "In our first discussion about the lack of services for people with a severe acquired brain injury on RTÉ Radio One’s \"Late Debate\" in March 2014, one of Ireland’s leading neurologists said to us: \"I understand your personal tragedy, but you need to understand that a health system with limited resources has to invest these resources in patients who have a reasonable chance of a meaningful recovery\". A rehabilitation nurse who asked about our son’s accident concluded, while standing right beside his bed, that it might have been better had he died. The first question asked by one neuro nurse was, which nursing home he would be going to. When Pádraig started to move his legs more actively but with little control in October 2018, we brought him to the emergency department as we suspected that he was pushing the ball at the end of his femur out of the socket. In 2019, he was suffering so much pain that he could not sleep and was rapidly losing weight. He was referred to an orthopaedic consultant. This appointment finally came through in May 2022, two and a half or three years later.",
                "In the meantime, fearing for his life, we desperately pleaded for help. No help was offered. Eventually, at the height of the first Covid-19 lockdown, in June 2020, we drove to Germany, where Pádraig was admitted to and successfully treated in an orthopaedic clinic in Munich using a minimally invasive procedure called percutaneous myofasciotomy. This was followed by a period in a specialised therapy centre. The consultants who treated Pádraig in 2020 are now philanthropically involved in developing our services. They have seen and helped several of our clients both in Germany and in Ireland.",
                "It is national policy to cease admission of under-65s to nursing homes. In continuing to admit them, Ireland is failing in its obligations under Article 26 of the UNCRPD to “maintain maximum independence” and to “support participation and inclusion in the community and all aspects of society...as close as possible to their own communities, including in rural areas”. An Saol Foundation, as a day service, provides the supports and services to enable Ireland to fulfil these human rights obligations. Services should start with the most in need, not end before they get to them.",
                "Encouraged by the HSE, we proposed Teach An Saol, the national centre for life and living with a severe acquired brain injury, and submitted the proposal to the HSE and the Minister of State with responsibility for disability in June 2023. We proposed six regional services and a national hub to support them. The sustainable development goals call on governments to leave no one behind. We can fulfil this obligation for people with an SABI through An Saol services. To date, we have received - we are very proud of this - enthusiastic support from the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, a letter of comfort from Dublin City Council for land in Ballymun and expressions of support for two hubs of the centre from the chief officer of CHO 9, with qualified support for the remaining two hubs, if no satellite centres. We have established a strong philanthropic planning and design group with six of Ireland’s largest architectural, planning, engineering and legal firms which aim to submit planning permission applications and tenders for the design and build of the proposed development at the beginning of December. We have also established a high-profile international clinical governance committee to guarantee regulatory compliance of Teach An Saol’s current and planned services, temporary assisted living and especially respite.",
                "This project offers a golden opportunity to the HSE and the nation to create a long overdue national centre with international visibility for people who have so far been left behind. Current national, EU and international legislation and conventions, including Article 26 of the UNCRPD, as well as new and emerging scientific and medical evidence, and, not least, plain human decency demand that they grasp it. Ireland can fulfil its obligations under Article 26 of the UNCRPD by providing An Saol Foundation with an adequate 2024 budget in support of its expanding services, as recommended in the 2023 HSE report, funding for Teach An Saol in the HSE 2025 capital plan and new revenue funding for the delivery of additional services, including respite, transitional living and social, clinical, and regional satellite centres.",
                "In summary, the HSE supported us to pilot An Saol Foundation service. Through difficult times, including the Covid-19 pandemic, we provided a service addressing an unmet need for perhaps the most marginalised group of people in the country. The HSE commissioned an independent evaluation of the service and subsequently recommended expansion. Committee members have heard our plans for expansion. I ask them to support us now by adding their strong voices to those of the independent evaluators. I ask them to please support our request for the necessary funding to do what is necessary and what Article 26 of the UNCRPD calls for. This is the time for Deputies, especially Ministers and the Taoiseach, to take decisive leadership and act. We cannot allow this opportunity to lose momentum and die a slow death because, for our injured family members, this is literally a matter of life and death."

Now is the right time to have this discussion.",
                "It would be helpful for me to ask some questions that the witnesses might regard as obvious, but it is important we get the answers on the record. The State's plans under the neurorehabilitation strategy have not yet been implemented to the extent they need to be. Everyone accepts, and it has been shown in the reports that have been done, that there is a serious deficit. In different parts of the country, dramatically different supports are available to individuals and families. Are the witnesses happy with the strategy? Should it be fully implemented or are there things the State is missing under the strategy, which is now a few years old? Within the strategy, what areas would they like to see prioritised for delivery next year? It would be useful for us to know in order to be able to have a conversation with the relevant Ministers. The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is listening. I think, from my conversations with her, that she has a real interest in this area, but she needs the backup and support from a committee like this one to fight for resources. It would be good if the witnesses could outline in practical terms what priorities they would like us to push for.",
                "I am aware of the document they published just before the budget announcement, which most of us received. It shows the disparity between different parts of the country and where we need to see new infrastructure put in place as well as the therapists and support teams that are needed in those rehabilitation centres to improve community and clinical care.",
                "I thank Mr. Schäler for talking about his personal story as well as the challenges that many families like his face. I would be interested to get his request crystalised about the budget An Saol Foundation needs for next year.",
                "I know An Saol effectively looked at what it has for this year, €600,000, as a reduction. Is €800,000 the figure it needs? Is the organisation a section 39 voluntary organisation? What frustrations does it experience in getting the staff and the skills it needs while competing with section 38 and other State-funded organisations? I am very familiar with the section 38 versus section 39 issue, particularly in relation to hospice care. We spent many years trying to change the status of a number of hospices, such as Marymount Hospice in my own constituency but others as well, regarding their inability to manage budgets while effectively doing the same work as many HSE facilities. Is that the same issue in this sector in terms of the capacity to get the staffing and skills needed and the cost of that? Obviously, that relates to the financial support it gets from the State to be able to do that.",
                "An Saol goes into quite a lot of detail in terms of what it is actually asking for, which is very helpful. The way it is presented to the committee is helpful and it effectively asks us to take a look at it and question the Minister and the Department as to why that approach should or should not be supported. I am interested to know the consistency of that action plan that was outlined to us today in the call for action with the neurorehabilitation strategy that is in place and in need of full implementation. Are we doing what we need to do in a way that is consistent with what is being asked for today or does that plan or strategy need to be adapted further in the context of the pilot project that has been supported and what An Saol want to do beyond that?",
                "I was quite moved by what Mr. Schäler had to say about his experience of the commentary on the approach to people who have been severely impacted by an acquired brain injury or similar. Of course, we have to approach this as a healthcare response where people who are most severely impacted get the most help as opposed to measuring the response on the basis of some other metric. That is an extraordinary thing to say in terms of some of the quotes he has outlined and I understand his deep frustration as a father in responding to that. I hope we can be helpful as a committee but it would be useful for me anyway if some of the questions I have asked are answered."

The main gaps at the moment are in in-patient neurorehabilitation beds but also, very significantly, and my two member organisations here today would speak in detail to this, we have a gap in long-term rehabilitation which comes under the national neurorehabilitation strategy, but rehabilitation does not end at the hospital door. Rehabilitation does not end after 12 weeks of a community neurorehabilitation team.",

I would like my colleagues from An Saol and MS Ireland to outline for the committee what the long-term rehabilitation piece is and the gaps that exist because that is where we see a significant gap and a commitment in the strategy that still remains to be implemented."

We have extraordinary support for this. In my mind, that is a unique opportunity and it might just go away if we do not take it up. Dublin City Council has identified a site and has given us a letter saying it is holding this for us. The HSE is supportive of phase 1 and the two first hubs, which is basically a reflection of what we do at the moment. There is a social hub and therapy hub and it says it is happy to finance and support it. There have been meetings with the chief valuer of Dublin City Council and I believe the HSE has received a proposal this week for the transfer of the land to the HSE.",

The group helps us from a planning, design, engineering, architectural and legal point of view. They all do that for free. I do not really want to say this but if you look at what it has cost just to plan some of the sheds and huts around here, to get a whole campus for free and to be presented with this on a plate is great. Having an organisation behind this that has a proven track record to deliver on what it promises is fantastic. This is a service, and the HSE itself has said this in its report which the committee has, that has been repeatedly demonstrated is needed and is a service An Saol Foundation effectively delivers and is a service that needs to be expanded. It could position Ireland internationally as a leading provider of these kinds of services. There is a unique opportunity and that is the main ask we have.",
                "Deputy Coveney referred to the budget and that is the other ask. It is surprising to see the HSE make recommendations for the development of our service and then not allow us to do that because it says we can only do what we get the money for. It asked us what we need to start implementing some of the recommendations in May 2023 and we told it we needed €880,000. It asked us again and we said we told the HSE that before. I then received an email saying we were getting €600,000. We spent €570,000 last year, but with the increase in costs, that is not really an increase at all. It is in fact a reduction in funding. That is the second ask.",
                "The third ask is more medium to long term and will require not just capital funding for the remaining two hubs, the respite and transitional living ones, but also revenue funding to run the service. That is an issue and a point CHO 9 has a problem with because it says if it pays us to run that service, it has to take that money away from somewhere else so it has to be additional funding."

Given the roles these centres play, it is crucial to ensure that they are bolstered by long-term community neurorehabilitation, which is needed to address the growing demand for care. As the witnesses have said, there has been progress with the team being funded, but how can we ensure there will be recruitment? From what I can gather, it seems to be a big problem. It is important to have the expertise necessary to operate these centres.",
                "I looked through the table that has been provided on the gaps in service in the CHOs for inpatient neurorehabilitation services and community neurorehabilitation teams across the country. It is recommended that there should be six persons for every 100,000 of population. CHO 5 has none. CHO 2 has none. My own area, CHO 9, which includes Dublin North-West, Dublin Central and Dublin North-Central, has 3.3 for 675,000. It just shows the work that must be done and the funding that is required. That seems to be a significant problem. I recently had a person in with me who needs two carers. The person had a fall, got badly hurt and was in a wheelchair, but only one person could be supplied to them. That seems to happen a great deal. The new centre was mentioned. It is very important to have a centre of excellence where different groups are located. It makes it easier to gather all the statistics needed to find out what the problems are. I do not know where we are in that regard, but from what has been said, we are a good bit away from that.",

A person of 65 can go into a nursing home but it is a different situation if a person who is 18 is stuck for a place. The gap must be filled in some way if that is what is required. There is much to be done in that regard, and it requires funding. The witnesses will have our support in whatever they want us to do in terms of chasing a Minister or Department. I will do that and I will raise issues. Deputy Tully is also on the committee. I will also raise the needs of the witnesses with our health spokesperson."

These services must be sustained and expanded to enable people to keep living well within their communities. The neurorehabilitation strategy itself refers to the crucial role of voluntary sector providers in the rehabilitation and long-term management of neurological conditions. The specialist nature of the services that we as voluntary sector organisations provide in bolstering the services that are in place cannot be overstated.",
                "Ms Rogers picked up on the point earlier that the teams are one step in a rehabilitation journey. Neurorehabilitation needs to go on long beyond the 12 weeks. The CNRTs are only meant to provide a short burst of rehabilitation. There is a need for people to transition from a medically unwell phase and for those who are living with progressive and acquired neurological conditions to reintegrate back into society – to get back to work, for example, if that is something they want to do. It is all about person-centred care. We are not starting from ground zero in terms of those services. They are in place and they are being funded on the ground in regard to the longer term piece.",
                "Deputy Ellis mentioned neuromapping. The report that was published in April 2023 found that nearly 100 unique services and supports were provided across the country, including supported living, respite, and vocational services. From our perspective, the value of those community-based services and their specialist nature for people living with neurological conditions is a lifespan piece. I will call out a couple of pieces where that is happening in practice, not only in MS Ireland but across the NAI. For example, the implementation framework outlines long-term rehabilitation services in the community as encompassing residential. As Ms Rogers outlined in regard to our national MS respite centres, we have had some wins in those areas. We are seeing investment there. We received an investment of €250,000 to keep us open seven days a week to the end of this year. The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, acknowledged the importance of a good respite service being adequately funded and used to full capacity, especially in light of the difficulties we face in the sector. The gap is in the sustained support of those services, which really make a difference in the lives of people living with MS, but also other neurological conditions.",
                "Acquired Brain Injury Ireland has transitional rehabilitation units. One property, for example, is in Sligo. It provides structured rehabilitation with one-to-one skilled rehabilitation assistance. It is person-centred, which goes to the heart of what the UNCRPD is all about. People who have used the centre argue that no two brain injuries are the same, so it is individualised. No two neurological conditions are the same, and the impacts on the person are not the same for any two individuals, even though they may have the same neurological condition. I know this is happening with our organisation in the physiotherapy programmes we provide to people with a range of neurological conditions. There is no good in these services existing in a silo. It is all about preventing crises and keeping people living well in the community should they wish to do so. An Saol Foundation has discussed the services it has.",
                "On the vocational piece, Headway has been in touch as well about the extremely effective programmes it has in place, in pockets. Deputy Ellis mentioned bolstering services in CHO 9. Services are being bolstered in certain areas, but it is not happening across the country. Depending on where they live, people living with neurological conditions are not receiving the same standard of long-term rehabilitation. It is a postcode lottery at the moment. Even our own organisation has pockets where we do not have a service. That must change in order to enable people living with neurological conditions, including multiple sclerosis, to live well in their community and to get back into society."

When our son was in hospital I thought there must be something for a 23-year old who had a very severe accident. We thought there must be a service somewhere to look after him and help him. For months, I thought I was not looking hard enough. I met Ms Rogers at the time. She might remember that. I spent two or three days with Acquired Brain Injury Ireland in different centres. I talked to Headway on several occasions. They all told me they were very sorry but that no service was available for that level of injury.",

It was he who really inspired the whole thing. He showed us that he wanted to continue to live. It was like that. The families of most of our core clients were asked if they would donate their organs, because their life was going to be unbearable and they could increase the quality of somebody else's life.",

Most conversations happen as conversations and it is kind of hard to say afterwards whether something really was what was said. There is a mother who wanted to bring her son to a swimming pool and she needed a referral. Rather than getting the referral, she got a letter back from the head of the brain injury programme. We have the letter and the mother is happy to share it. Basically it said that there was no point in any further interventions and that the only thing her son needed was to be kept comfortable, which is another word for palliative care. It was not only the mother who received that letter; the consultant also sent the letter to all nine treating centres so that everybody who had been in touch with that patient knew to not touch him as it was not worth it, to forget about it. That same patient is in our centre now, is getting better and is putting bets on horses. There is fun. Tragedies are not all and only tragedies. This is something about which clinicians have a different view from families and the people who look at human rights, even if someone has a very severe injury and even if the clinicians have tried everything and say that someone cannot be cured.",

When we talk about the habilitation piece of the rehabilitation, we are trying to help people to live a life with severe acquired brain injury. It is not about getting rid of the severe acquired brain injury; it is about life and living with it. We are trying to help the people directly affected by it and their families to live as good a life as possible. Is that response okay for the Cathaoirleach?"

                "A severe acquired brain injury is usually defined as being a condition where a person has been in an unconscious state for six hours or more or post-traumatic amnesia of 24 hours or more. These patients are likely to be hospitalised and receive rehabilitation once the acute phase has finished. That definition is taken very much at the time of injury whereas we look at the people when they come to us. We focus more on how they are now. We assess them objectively using outcome measures that measure how dependent they are on other people and how much assistance they need for their daily activities. That is one section of it. We also look at their cognitive status. For example, do they need assistance making decisions under the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act? We also look at their social setting. Are they living at home? Do they have support at home or are they living in a care home? These are the kinds of people we work with on a day-to-day basis. They are the most vulnerable people we have. As Mr. Schäler said, there are services for them. We take them and we look at what their goals are along with what their needs are. At the same time, we consider the physical activity guidelines set out by the WHO and by the clinical practice guidelines. We try to apply them to the clients. There are physical activity guidelines and we consider the body, mind and soul concept. There are physical activity guidelines for people without disability and the same guidelines exist for people with disabilities. They might have to do it a little bit differently but we still do it. We use a mixed model of robotic gait therapy and we use conventional gym equipment that has been modified to the person's abilities. We manage to get them to do the activities that everybody needs to stay healthy. With the mind and soul element of what we try to do, our clients are brought into a big open clinic with people working on different things at different times of the day. There is a big open space where people get to interact with each other. It is a community where everyone is rowing in the same boat. There is a sense of fun, there are jokes and horses are talked about. It is an opportunity for the clients to share their experiences with each other and it is the same thing for the families. They get to share tips and share stories. They get to live this together as we go forward.",
                "We try to adapt this holistic approach to our setting under the HSE's New Directions framework of 2015. We look at the principles of the patient-centred approach, community inclusion, independence, quality of life and promoting equal rights for people with disabilities. Article 26 speaks about habilitation and rehabilitation and our success can be measured. Yes, certain people are improving and there are people who have gone back to work and gone back to university, and they are back driving, but that will not be the case for everybody, as Mr. Schäler said. Other people might get to go on a trip away with their family. They might get to spend some time with their friends. Other successes are that people are not getting sick, not having to spend time in hospitals or going to the GP, and not having antibiotics. There are different ways of measuring our success and the effectiveness of what we are doing. We are just looking for the support to continue to do that."

                "I will give a brief history of Shane and our life for the past 12 years. Shane suffered a severe acquired brain injury 12 years ago when he was assaulted and attacked on his way home after a night out. He was brought to University Hospital Galway, UHG, and subsequently into Beaumont Hospital where he spent six weeks getting treatment. He was subsequently transferred back to UHG where he spent a further six months. He was transferred from there to the National Rehabilitation Hospital, NRH, in Dún Laoghaire for three months of rehabilitation. Like Mr. Schäler the first question we were asked when we went in the door of the NRH was, \"What nursing home is he going to?\" Unfortunately, given where we live we could not bring Shane home but we had planned to build a house and get him home. We were told that maybe we should take the other line and maybe the nursing home was the best avenue. After the three months, it was back to hospital and, subsequently, he was removed to a nursing home in Tuam. For the past 12 years, Shane's life has been in a nursing home. It has been very difficult for us as a family. My wife Joan spends possibly six to eight hours of the day with him. Even though he is being cared for in the nursing home, Joan is with him all the time. I go down in the evening when I can after work.",
                "Going back to what happened to Pádraig, some years ago when Covid hit the nursing home, Shane's oxygen levels dropped so severely he was rushed to hospital. We followed them in and Joan went in with him to the accident and emergency department. She was allowed stay with him and stayed in a room with him for the week just so he would have someone with him who was not a stranger to him. It was not until three weeks afterwards that Joan sat down with me and said, \"I have to tell you something and don't get mad\". I asked, \"What is it, love?\". She said that when she went into the accident and emergency department, she was brought into a room and sat down and told that if Shane's condition did not improve, there would be no intervention and they would make him comfortable. He was a 31-year-old man. What did they mean by \"make him comfortable\"? I would not leave it at that. I contacted the hospital and made a complaint. I got a letter back, which I have here. Basically, it was the HSE's directive that with Shane's pre-existing condition, which was a brain injury and there was nothing else wrong with him physically, they would let him die if things did not improve. Thankfully, things did improve and Shane is still with us.",
                "It is hard going into a nursing home to see him. As Deputy Ellis said, it is no place for a 30-year-old or an 18-year-old. Shane has been there since he was 22 or 23. The care is okay. It is basic care but we have to pay for our own therapists to come in. We pay for our own rehab physiotherapist, occupational therapist and music therapy. Anyone we get in we have to pay for. We are lucky that we set up a charitable trust ten or 12 years ago and we were able to fund it from those funds. There are simple things, however. For example, Shane has had a problem with his teeth for five years and it is only next week we are getting him in. We have to bring him to Dublin to the dental clinic. We have to hire a private ambulance to get him there for an assessment. If anyone had a pain in their tooth five years ago, they would get it seen to within a week.",
                "It is five years, and we have no guarantee as to when Shane will get treated. Our life is like that.",
                "It was between five and seven years ago that Mr. Schäler contacted me, and we met and discussed An Saol. It is a fantastic organisation. Shane unfortunately has not been able to get to Dublin yet. In the meantime, I successfully found a unit in Tuam that will be used as a satellite centre for An Saol. It is HSE run and newly opened. I was in contact with the staff about two months ago and they were delighted to facilitate us. Again, it is all about getting staff and people to work with us. Shane needs this. We bring him out as much as we can. We make life as normal for him as we can. However, the Government and everyone else need to come and see what is needed. Shane is a functioning adult. He has two fantastic nephews. He has a sister and a family unit around him. We go in to him every day and play his music and he responds at times. He has minimal consciousness, so he is on the severe end, but other than that he is still our son. No one has the right to say to us that he should not be here with us. It is only decency. It is only something that any member of the committee would ask for a sick child. That is what we are looking for.",
                "We hope that when Mr. Schäler's Teach An Saol project is up and running we will be able to bring Shane up there. He will be able to stay up there and have treatments for a month. We cannot go up and down in a day or two days. There is no place in Dublin that will cater for Shane with an overnight stay because of his condition. With Teach An Saol that future is unbelievable, and I again congratulate Mr. Schäler on what he has done and achieved so far. We can get people from all over the country to go up and find this other way out. Shane's three-month stay in Dún Laoghaire was a basic three months. They did little for him other than what they had to do and sent us home.",
                "We do not have a consultant. There is no one in charge of Shane's medical issues at the moment. It is all up to my wife, Joan, as regards what is wrong if Shane is feeling off form. She has to guess. She is at a stage now where she knows what it might be. If Shane has to go into a hospital, he has to go into the emergency department and lie on a trolley or in a bed. He is 6 ft 4 in. The bed is usually too short for him. We have to go through all this. My wife spends all the time in hospital with him. She sits in a chair with him because he has to go through so many tests. Then, after a week, they send him back to the nursing home with an antibiotic or something. That is our life, and it is difficult. It is a short synopsis of what we have been through for 12 years. There is light at the end of the tunnel, and it is Teach An Saol and the satellite centres, which can be developed right across the country with a bit of help. A bit of money is needed, of course. Mr. Schäler said it is about securing the finance for next year, and not to be worrying about it and wondering if we are running out of funds to keep what we have in place when we are coming into October or November. We need it to be there and maybe have a bit extra for the Christmas party at the end of the year, so we are not always panicking about finance. I am self-employed. Business is tough, but it is nice to know you have enough there to get you through the year and that your family will be looked after."

Last week, the HSE published a report on inpatient beds around the country for a range of clinical areas, including orthopaedic rehabilitations but neurorehabilitation was in there as well. We now have specific figures on the number of dedicated neurorehabilitation beds around the country and there is a stark gap in the north west as regards the number of those beds. I see in CHO 1 just 13 of those dedicated neurorehabilitation beds. That is a huge gap that still exists. We have seen progress on the strategy, but in two particular areas in the north west there is that gap with inpatient neurorehabilitation beds. The community neurorehabilitation team in CHO 1 does not reach out to the Deputy's county of Sligo. It is only a team of three, so it is only serving people in County Donegal.",

Every year, section 39 organisations have to go through service arrangements with the HSE. It is year-to-year funding. The question is this: how can we develop a brand new service that has no template to follow? We are doing something for a group of people who have literally been left to die. They have been left to rot in nursing homes, with minimal services. One parent was told to face the facts and that what their son needed was hydration, nutrition and medication. That person is actively engaged with our service now.",

When we started, we proposed something for three to five clients and now we have 28. The demand is growing. How can we hire and pay staff on an annual budget when we do not know what we are going to get next year? We do not need people who are just coming out of university and who have the title to be a physiotherapist, an occupational therapist, a speech and language therapist or a neuropsychologist. We need people with experience. These people are in their 30s. They are not people who are going to work on a six-month or annual contract. They are people with families who have or are about to apply for a mortgage. They are looking for permanent contracts. How can anybody be given a permanent contract if we do not know what our funding will be for next year? If we are being told to expand our service and then six months later we are being told to forget about all of the recommendations and that we are not getting the money, there is no way we can grow.",

They are people who believe that what they are doing really makes sense and has meaning. These people are really hard to find. Sometimes, I wish we could give those people the same job security and all the benefits that one gets in the public service. We would like to be able to give that to the people who work so enthusiastically with us. Unfortunately, we cannot and this is a big issue.",
                "To go back to the ask, we have developed a service for people for whom there was no waiting list, because they were written off. There were no gaps because there was no service where you could have a gap. It is for people who were literally written off. We have one letter which says these people were written off. It speaks about them being no-hopers and people who were not worth the money, because they did not offer a return on the investment. Clinicians are trained to heal people or rehabilitate them, to get them back to where they were. What we are doing cannot be measured in the same way. We help people to live the life they have been given. We give them joy, fun and an environment where they can live a healthy life. We had another example where someone was going to get some medication to help them with their osteoporosis. It turned out that they did not have osteoporosis. After ten years of being in a wheelchair, they were healthy. They are people who are not taking any medication. We have been told by doctors to continue doing what we are doing, because it really seems to work. People were surprised by this. We see secondary injuries with clients; contractures, foot drop, etc. There is nothing we can do about the event itself, but whatever happens afterwards is our responsibility. We have to take on this responsibility. We are not calling for someone to do this for us. We are doing it and have been for the past four years, very successfully. The only thing we are asking for is that this is recognised and that we be allowed to develop the service for the people who need it. There are not even statistics about them. When we have been asked for numbers and figures, we have extrapolated from some of the experts who reviewed our service. They extrapolated figures from the UK. It is estimated that 25 people per year in Ireland require those services. In the past ten or 11 years since Pádraig's accident there are probably 300 people who have a similar injury. Where are they? Have they died or are they somewhere in a nursing home being turned once or twice a day with a TV as background noise? We do not know. This is also something we are addressing with researchers in UCD who have experience in epidemiology and have done similar studies for cystic fibrosis. We want to find out where those people are, how many of them there are and how can we help them.",

It is about prevention and helping people to live their lives with their injury."

They tell me that they got excellent acute care and had a good experience in the National Rehabilitation Hospital and were lucky enough to be able to go home, not to a nursing home. However, then there was nothing. This lack of follow-up leads to regression. It has led to family breakdown and mental health issues because the supports are not available in the community.

We should be ensuring that people are able to live their best lives. If the strategy were to be implemented tomorrow, what would the priorities be to make things better immediately?

The cost for one person for 52 weeks would be €81,328. For 26 of our clients who are not able to live at home and have to be in a nursing home, the cost would be €2.1 million a year. If we consider what Mr. Schäler has said our asking price is, I would say it is a saving. What is not taken into account is that if these people were not in a nursing home, they would have to be in an acute hospital. At a committee meeting in 2019, the Taoiseach, Deputy Harris, who was Minister for Health at the time, said the average running cost of an inpatient hospital bed across acute hospitals is €878 per night. Members might do some maths on that and calculate the cost of a week's stay or a month's stay for someone who was not getting these interventions. Looking at the health economics of it, what we are trying to implement is a short-term investment for long-term gain."

One of the programmes we are trying to implement at the moment and for which we have submitted a business case is our new physiotherapy programme. We have pilot projects called Active Neuro running in the midwest. Thank God, reduction of healthcare utilisation after this project is 43%. We have a 49% reduction in the number of people falling. As the average cost of a hip fracture is between €12,000 and €22,000, prevention of hip replacements could pay for a senior physical therapist in one CHO.

My colleagues here from An Saol Foundation and MS Ireland have addressed the longer-term costs but there are also the immediate costs, such as the bed days lost when people are not being transferred out of acute hospitals because there are no rehabilitation places. There is actually a recent report issued by the HSE on the issue of delayed transfer of care because of not having rehabilitation services. I will ensure the Deputy gets a copy of that report. That work has been done and it highlighted a really important point, which is that neuro rehabilitation needs to be put in place for many reasons, including for the effective running of our health services. There is a need for that transfer to be available in order that people can move from acute care that is really very good onto the longer-term support services.",
                "The Deputy asked a very good question on what has been done and what needs to happen. We have seen the progress from the outset and we have all said from the outset that there needs to be nine community neuro rehabilitation teams around the country. We still have gaps in that regard. We have two major gaps in the neuro rehabilitation strategy at the moment. A HSE report issued just last week showed for the first time the extent of the gap when it comes to inpatient beds. We always knew there was a very significant deficit in neuro rehabilitation beds. The HSE report last week is stark. On the overall deficit, we have a 58% shortfall in the number of neuro rehabilitation beds in the country. What is that doing? It means that people in the regions are not getting access to neuro rehabilitation in a rehabilitation setting. It also means that the National Rehabilitation Hospital, NRH, in Dún Laoghaire is becoming a funnel for all neuro rehabilitation referrals, which it was never meant to be. It is a complex specialist centre for a particular type of rehabilitation. However, there is now such pressure on the NRH that we see waiting lists of three to six months. We have almost become used to long waiting lists in the NRH. We almost do not question them anymore. As a result of that lack of beds around the country, everything is funnelling into the NRH.",
                "Finally, we have a major gap in long-term rehabilitation services. Organisations such as MS Ireland and An Saol Foundation provide pockets of service, but we do not have them throughout the country. We do not have equal access to them. Those are the two pieces where the neuro rehabilitation strategy still has a lot to do."

Both Pat and I gave up our day jobs, in which we were doing productive work that we could still be doing. We cannot do that work, however, because there are no services to help us to look after our son. It is not just our case; it is everybody else's cases, including those in the Gallery.

There is a huge cost to society in that regard that is sometimes overlooked.",
                "Our personal experience is that the waiting list at the NRH is not three to six months. We went to Germany. When Pádraig had the accident on Cape Cod, he came back to Dublin and eventually was seen by consultants. We were told there would be a waiting time of a year. We have heard that from other clients in An Saol Foundation as well. They are waiting for over a year. The time at the NRH was predetermined. It was not dependent on the condition of the person. Everybody who was severely affected was going to get three months. Those three months were not so much about getting the people better. They were getting some clinical interventions but it was not to get them better; it was to assess them. They wrote two books that explained it. They basically planned the rest of their lives, so that when they were going to the nursing home, the nursing home would know how to feed them, how to position and transfer them and all that kind of stuff. That took just three months. In some cases, a home care package was arranged. That was what the three months were for. After that - there has been scientific research on this - these people fall off a cliff. That is it. Once you get out of there, forget about it.",

It is difficult to understand that. We have many people to help us to do what is needed, what people have told us is needed and what the families are looking for. What they have experienced is a really good service. Let us do it.

I have before me a full page of laws that are potentially being breached. You could look at the Constitution, European legislation or international legislation. They all demand that people with disability, whatever the level of disability, have the same rights as the people who are sitting here. Imagine your husband, wife, son or daughter was in a situation like that and you were told, \"If he does not get better, we will just keep him comfortable.\" That breaks your heart. It is hard to imagine anything worse. Of course, interventions have to be paid for, but people have a right to those interventions.",

I understand they have offered to do this for it. I just hope the HSE does not come along and say it is going to do it its way. If it does, we are in trouble, as are the witnesses' sons and daughters because it will go the way other projects go. I am not being critical; I am being factual. As a committee, if we are to do a report on this, we have to make sure we say that this is a project that we can do differently and show how things should be done right. That is important.",

People listening to this for the first time may find this shocking. I said when I came to the committee first that there are things that happen that we, as politicians, should not be proud of. Listening to the witnesses' stories today, we should not be proud of where we have left a lot of these people. They are our citizens and need their rights to be upheld. It is up to us to do that. We heard as powerful a presentation today as I ever heard and it is important that we take it on board rather than paying lip service to it.",

They complained about the service. Members might remember a \"Prime Time Investigates\" programme about Patrick Fitzgerald. His wife had a brain injury and she was placed in a home. When he complained, he was subsequently prevented from seeing his wife. When he was allowed to visit, it was for an hour and a security guard knocked on the door and told him when it was time for him to leave. A similar issue arose in relation to a woman who had a son in Dublin. She complained about the services and her son was swiftly made a ward of court, which wrote her out of the equation altogether. She had to visit him in Dublin but she did not have the money to go there. The whole family was broken up.",

To my mind, the comparisons are difficult to make, but you know when something is fundamentally wrong. People are forgotten about. They are locked up somewhere and not seen. Some of our clients have issues going out because they are afraid to be looked at and seen. They are not integrated into society. That is still happening. We know it is happening. We cannot say we do not know about it. People are left behind, ignored, and literally written off. That is happening in front of our eyes. We cannot allow it to happen. We have an opportunity to change it. It is up to us to do something about it. It is similar for people with other conditions, but the service must reach the people who need it first and not stop when it gets to them because they are not worth it. People have rights.

We have seen teams rolled out around the country. She mentioned the vacancies in her region, CHO 3. It is just half the team that needs to be in place. It is not that there are vacant posts. It is that they have not been funded for a full team. There is less than half of the full neurorehabilitation team of 12 whole-time equivalents in CHO 3.",

We now have the stark, clear data on the number of neurorehabilitation beds around the country. There is no getting away from it. In Deputy Wynne's region, CHO 3, there are just six dedicated neurorehabilitation beds. There should be six per 100,000, but CHO 3 is down to 1.5 per 100,000. It is another area of the country where we see a stark deficit of inpatient neurorehabilitation beds. What does that mean?

It is totally understandable that the State would like the NAI, as an organisation, to lead. The State relies on section 39 organisations in lots of areas. They do an amazing job, in many cases, more efficiently than the State could do it because of the kind of resourcefulness the witnesses have spoken about today in putting together a coalition of very smart, experienced people, many of whom are doing it for nothing in terms of financial reward. It would be helpful for me to understand whether the centre they want to create is very much consistent with what we need in terms of the overall strategy? Should it be prioritised as a big capital expenditure for next year? The sum is €25 million. If an extra €100 million is to be spent in this area, is a quarter of that to go to the project? Is that the best way we can spend the money? I do not know what the figure will be, but we have pushed for an increased spend, certainly on the capital side, because there is a lot of capital available. With that capital comes a significant current spend in terms of staffing, which the witnesses have outlined will save the State money, rather than cost it money in the medium term and ensure that people are in an appropriate residential setting, as opposed to a nursing home or a hospital.",

Trying to crystallise those asks would be helpful for us because there is such a strong case for all of this to be done.

As I said, we have seen significant progress in 2024 with regard to our MS respite centre, where a quarter of a million euro was invested, but we need to see that on a sustained basis. Our ask for budget 2025 was €627,000 per annum on a sustainable basis to keep that respite centre open, keep people living well at home and prevent crises in families. Families living with MS tell us that if it was not for our respite centre, their loved one would have had to enter a nursing home, which is not where the family want them to be or where the person wants to be. The critical nature of these services cannot be overstated. Our other ask for budget 2025 was around the physiotherapy programme and the €880,000 investment that we referenced earlier, which could save the State up to €19 million a year by delaying and reducing the disability caused by MS.",
                "I know my other colleagues in the Neurological Alliance of Ireland, including An Saol and other member organisations, will speak to their own projects, which are of phenomenal value. I know there are also asks from other NAI organisations dealing with Parkinson's and muscular dystrophy, such as ABI and Headway. I do not want to understate the value that these services are providing on the ground to people with a range of neurological conditions. I am representing MS Ireland today and An Saol is also present, but there are 30 member organisations behind us that all have key asks. We cannot understate the value of those services for people living with the conditions on the ground."

That does not mean the full capital cost has to be allocated for next year but enough to allow us to start doing that. It will probably take two or three years to finish it. As to whether it is a priority for the NAI, it is probably not. As my colleague said, there are more than 30 organisations represented by the NAI, so what do we prioritise? We can only highlight our own organisation’s needs. I am very pragmatic. I still have a lot of energy and I am trying to preserve that and invest it in a service that is really needed but has not been there to date.",

I started to read all of the strategies, papers, reports and plans. What I saw was that they were all saying what we were doing, but what was lacking was the filtering through to the practice. That is what we are demonstrating. We have proposed something that will go way beyond the services that we offer to people with severe acquired brain injuries. It is a model that can be duplicated not just in that area but in many other areas where similar services are required. I am obviously a bit biased but we have the backup of international experts to support that. It is a model that other people will be able to replicate and we can all learn from it. There is an opportunity to kick that off and if we let it pass, we will all be sorry in a year or two."

We sent a proposal to the HSE that outlined what we needed and it came to a sum of €880,000. That is to start developing the service that we deliver at the moment. The HSE has proposed that Teach An Saol should be built in two phases. The first phase would cover services that we already deliver, so there would not be a big increase in annual funding. We would then work on the respite and transitional living parts, which are services that are badly needed. We are all getting older and we do not know what is going to happen to our children in a few years’ time, and we do not want them to end up in a nursing home. We need this integrated centre. There is a reason that it has those four hubs and four elements. We would be happy to stage that in two phases and take a little bit of time to make sure it is sustainable."

I point out that neurorehabilitation in Ireland is starting from a very low base. While we have seen great progress in community neurorehabilitation teams, we are still at the bottom of Europe with regard to rehabilitation consultants and services that people take for granted in other countries throughout Europe. We really have to look at this. The neurorehabilitation strategy was published in 2019 and five years on, there is still so much to do. We are not just looking at next year but at planning beyond that to continue that investment in neurorehabilitation services.",
                "We have highlighted today that great work is being done in the community neurorehabilitation teams and there is definitely a piece around inpatient beds and the long-term neurorehabilitation that the organisations provide. However, one really important message that we would like the committee to take away today is that the voluntary sector needs to see itself in the neurorehabilitation strategy. We are part of the implementation of that strategy. The committee has heard today how the organisations are stepping up to the mark in so many parts of the country. This is not starting from scratch. Organisations are already providing the services but what we need is consistency. If an organisation is providing a service in one part of the country, why is it not being facilitated when there is a clear need to provide that in another part of the country? It is not just about year-on-year prioritisation and is very much about looking at the infrastructure of neurorehabilitation and how we build that up to get to where we need to be."

                "The British Irish Chamber of Commerce is the only organisation representing business activities with interests across our two islands - north, south, east and west. Our raison d'être is very simple - to champion and grow the trade between the UK and Ireland. I will give a quick recap on those figures. There is more than €100 billion in trade every single year, both ways, and it sustains approximately 600,000 jobs, of which 400,000 are in Great Britain. The majority of the jobs created by this trade are in Great Britain. A lot of people are not aware of that.",
                "Prior to the adoption of the Windsor Framework, the chamber was at the forefront of channelling our members' concerns in relation to the then Northern Ireland protocol. The chamber held the view that very specific arrangements for Northern Ireland were always needed to ensure that no physical border on the island of Ireland would be erected for customs purposes. Equally, we were very aware of the practical flaws of the then Northern Ireland protocol and we believed it was appropriate that pragmatic changes be made. While no compromise could be 100% perfect or equal to the pre-Brexit trading conditions, we believe that the Windsor Framework alleviated the worst trade impositions between Northern Ireland and Great Britain.",
                "When polling our members: 95% supported the framework as a pathway forward, of which 72% believed it would be net positive for our members; 23% indicated there would be no change, however 5% did indicate that it would be a net negative, based on pre-Brexit conditions.",
                "As a result of the Windsor Framework, there have been no discernible changes in moving goods between Ireland and Northern Ireland. As the chamber and others highlighted from the outset, no regulatory barriers could be developed that would not have an adverse impact not only on all-island trade but on the integrated nature of the all-island agrifood supply chain. To understand the workings of the Windsor Framework and its ongoing operational success we can look to cross-Border dairy co-operative Lakeland Dairies, represented by Mr. Donohoe.",
                "To give some context, Lakeland Dairies, with 3,200 farm families across 17 counties processes 2 billion litres of milk in facilities on both sides of the Irish Border and supplies 100 markets globally. Brexit posed significant challenges for the company, raising fears of a hard border, regulatory divergence, and potential disruptions to trade. Agriculture is vital to the Irish economy and concerns about tariffs, customs checks, and regulatory misalignment, particularly regarding food safety regulations, threatened the long-term viability of this business.",
                "Lakeland Dairies processes 400 million litres of Northern Irish milk annually in the Republic, with an additional 360 million litres moving South from other processors. Northern Ireland, although only 3% of the UK's population, accounted for 40% of the UK's dairy exports in 2023. The Windsor Framework has helped mitigate these risks by ensuring smooth trade between Northern Ireland, the Republic, and the broader European Union, securing the future of businesses like Lakeland Dairies and the livelihoods of thousands of farm families dependent on cross-Border trade. Mr. Donohoe will be happy to take any questions committee members may have later on the implementation of the framework from a Lakelands perspective.",
                "The Windsor Framework built on the protocol to simplify procedures relating to goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. At a high level, two new authorisations were introduced to widen the scheme for simplified movements along with a corresponding introduction of green and red lanes and “Not for EU” labelling on foodstuffs. This has primarily assisted the movement of food products to Northern Ireland supermarkets, as well as certain products for identifiable sale in retail in Northern Ireland.",
                "The position relating to the movement of goods for processing in Northern Ireland is more complex, particularly where the processed or finished product could ultimately be destined for sale internationally, in the EU, on the GB market and potentially in Northern Ireland. During September it was announced that the introduction of expected customs simplifications which were to support the green lane have been delayed to March 2025. These simplifications meant that full customs declarations would not be required for goods using the green lane. In addition, the UKIMS authorisation, essentially the trusted trader authorisation verifying that you are only importing for sale in the Northern Ireland market, is quite complex and time consuming and difficult for businesses outside the very large ones to complete.",
                "Through the Windsor Framework, the EU and UK agreed that UK public health and safety standards are applied to retail food and drink within Northern Ireland. These products must phase in labels in October stating that a product is \"Not for EU\". Originally it was intended that “Not for EU” labelling would be GB-wide but the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has agreed to no longer take this approach. as of yesterday, or the day before. This is a welcomed development as it would have created additional administrative burdens on businesses. However, some businesses had prepared for this scenario already.",
                "Unlike through the protocol, certain medicines approved by the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, or the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, MHRA, - the regulatory medicines authorities for the Republic and the UK - cannot flow on an all-island basis from January 2025. This is an example of an additional regulatory barrier between the North and South that did not exist prior to the implementation of the Windsor Framework.",
                "The Windsor Framework sets out simplified arrangements to support the critical flow of agrifood retail into Northern Ireland from Great Britain. However, despite reduced checks, appropriately there are checks on sanitary and phytosanitary, SPS, products from Great Britain. Further reductions would take place if a comprehensive SPS veterinary agreement was put in place between the EU and the UK. That has been a long-standing position of the chamber and one we have been articulating to the new UK Government for quite a time prior to its election.",
                "Despite logistical challenges and teething issues, the Windsor protocol is working as had been generally intended. As committee members are aware, Article 18 of the framework contains the \"democratic consent mechanism\". This is a vote by the Northern Ireland Assembly on whether Articles 5 to 10 of the Windsor Framework should continue to apply. That is where EU regulations are applied in Northern Ireland. This vote will take place this year - likely in December - and we will be advocating for consent for the continuance of this mechanism.",

Trade will go where it is easier to engage. The statistics bear this out. There has been an increase in all-Ireland trade North and South, which is to be expected. Great Britain-Northern Ireland trade is also rebounding. Finding that compromise has been a net positive. Businesses have certainly looked at their supply chains and have gone where they are most needed.",
                "Some of the fears outlined prior to the Windsor Framework or in the midst of some of the ebb and flow of the protocol regarding major companies not exporting to Northern Ireland have not come to fruition. Obviously, there have been teething issues from the get-go in respect of the Northern Ireland protocol. Many of them have been addressed, but there will always be teething issues with any new trade barrier. All-island trade has been the big beneficiary.",

                "Regarding the new UK Government, it is not just about a one-liner or quick sound bite. It is a reset in relations; there is no question about that. The new Government is coming at this from a different perspective to the previous one on quite a lot of issues. That is not to say that we did not work constructively with the previous Government or that we would not have disagreements with the current one. We are not an Irish organisation; we are a British-Irish organisation that is all about maximising trade. Certainly, Hilary Benn, the Northern Ireland Secretary, has been very proactive about engaging with us and members, listening to what is happening on the ground and trying to find compromises and proactive approaches to maximising the trade and economic environment for Northern Ireland.",
                "One thing we could all improve on is taking the opportunities of the Northern Ireland Windsor Framework, which addresses access and the unique position Northern Ireland has found itself in. It has been well publicised and highlighted. President Biden appointing Joe Kennedy is something that has been highlighted. I do not think enough is being done from across the business community to look at the opportunities from a more local perspective in terms of investment into Northern Ireland. It is one thing to consider going to North America or Asia to discuss the opportunities for Northern Ireland, but there are opportunities for companies much closer to home in terms of investing in Northern Ireland. As a chamber, we are going to up our game in terms of highlighting that. I do not think the potential upside is being talked about a great deal and has not yet been delivered. We are in the early stages. I will defer to Ms Lynch on some of the customs perspectives."

On the customs challenges, without getting into too much technical detail, the Windsor Framework is working and has simplified some of the issues that arose at the beginning of Brexit in terms of importing into and, primarily, exporting out of Northern Ireland. It has made it a lot easier for companies in Northern Ireland to export to Great Britain without customs declarations, something which was a big issue. It has put Northern Ireland in a position whereby exporters can export quite simply to the markets in Great Britain or Europe. That has worked extremely well.",
                "I see more challenges to come in respect of those companies which are set up more on the inward investment side, in particular large companies which will import from various territories for manufacture in Northern Ireland and then re-export those goods. In terms of trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, we have simplified declarations followed by supplementary declarations. That means that when companies import from Great Britain, they lodge a certain amount of information and then have to follow up with a supplementary declaration. We know there is quite a lag in those declarations.",
                "It is quite complex to work out whether goods are at risk of moving into the EU, given that goods which are being imported for manufacture could move in many different directions post-importation. A lot of people in Northern Ireland, in particular those involved in business, are a bit frustrated that the simplified procedure has been delayed again, something we have seen quite consistently throughout the Brexit process with the UK Government in particular. Those declarations were supposed to come into place but have been delayed until next March. Again, people prepare for these things. When they are delayed, that adds a further complication.",
                "The green lane, which is coming into effect in March, will make it easier for those goods which are not at risk of being re-exported. That will affect those goods which will remain in Northern Ireland. It still involves quite a substantial set-up process in advance in order to take advantage of it. It is not a simple process. Similarly, UKIMS authorisation, which companies can get for importing goods into Northern Ireland for sale in Northern Ireland is complete, is complex. The biggest challenge will be for companies which want to operate on a global basis and manufacture in Northern Ireland and export to the rest of the world."

The outworking of what was negotiated, namely the co-operation and trade agreement and, subsequently, the Windsor Framework, is what we are trying to figure out.",

From my discussions with a number of Labour people, some of whom are now in government, I would say there is some naivety about what can be achieved without being a member of the European Union. We know from the Conference of Parliamentary Committees for Union Affairs, COSAC, and talking to European colleagues that the rest of Europe has moved on. The entire focus of the European Union is now to the east and they do not want more time consumed by Brexit. In that context, I would be interested in hearing a couple of things.",

Connectivity to the Continent from Rosslare went from six sailings a week then to 46 currently. I did some work with the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly's economic committee. At that forum the hauliers told us that there was a dislocation of goods. A lot of goods coming directly either to Rosslare or into Dublin are now transiting further north. They are going directly to Northern Ireland to avoid any complications. Was that an initial factor or is it still one? How do the witnesses view connectivity in terms of the impact of Brexit and the Windsor Framework on the costs for businesses doing direct trade between the island of Ireland and Great Britain?",

That is very well put. The response that we have got is that we are open to listening and engaging with the new UK Government. The EU is completely supportive of a reset in relations, but the rule still applies: if you are not paying the membership fees of the golf club, you cannot play seven days a week. That was the analogy given to us. If we take, for example, the SPS veterinary agreement, which is stated chamber policy and has since become stated Labour Party policy and it will be formal UK Government policy, the EU is not looking for it, but it will entertain a request from the UK Government to engage in negotiations on an SPS veterinary agreement. It will be primarily down to the terms and conditions outlined in a lot of perspectives from the EU side of things. Something that the British have always struggled with is dynamic alignment. If the EU changes its regulations then the UK will have to follow. It is not just based on mutual recognition. That could be a sticking point for British politics, but we will not to dive into that. There would be a general upside to such an agreement. It is up to bodies like us to make the case, not just to the British Government, but also to the devolved administrations, which I know are advocating for it as well, in particular for Welsh lamb and Scottish whisky. These would benefit hugely from a veterinary agreement. The scale of exports from the European Union to Great Britain in terms of agrifood would be a net positive, with Ireland being a good example in terms of it being our biggest agrifood export market and also our biggest agrifood import market. There is a case being made in that regard. Deputy Howlin is absolutely right about the naivety.",
                "In terms of the checks coming down the line, I will defer to Ms Lynch on the various steps and the additional costs. When we put up trade barriers on the various checks that have to be implemented and the bureaucracy that goes with that, it is an inevitability that costs will go up. We can limit or reduce those costs, but the UK is slowly but surely bringing in a border-targeted operation model, BTOM, which is going to mean additional checks. That will mean additional paperwork, costs and bureaucracy for Irish companies.",
                "We have had round-table discussions with the UK Government and its officials about the physical infrastructure of those checks and the potential delays. We want to make sure that when the checks are brought in, they are as free-flowing and seamless as possible. In the heat of Brexit, we recall the talks of delays and the worry about the extent that they would be a factor. The devolved Welsh Government says it will not introduce border posts unless it feels the infrastructure and support is there to ensure that we do not have the bottlenecks we all fear.",
                "I referred to the reduced trade barriers in Ireland right now in terms of the capacity of Rosslare Port and Dublin Port and the transit of goods to Northern Ireland. Ms Lynch could correct me on whether that divergence will continue to maintain or if the trade will go directly into the Northern Irish ports when things are up and flowing as expected.",
                "We have met with Nick Thomas-Symonds. He is a very pragmatic guy. We are delighted he was appointed to the portfolio. There will be a couple of elements to it. The Government must keep doing what it is doing in terms of the reset of relations between the UK Government and the European Union. It is stated chamber policy that there is an opportunity in this regard. We have seen early elements of a secondment programme between the Civil Service in Ireland and in Great Britain. We have a lot to learn from each other. In particular, I do not like the idea that many of the British civil servants who helped to design the European Single Market are now being redeployed into various Departments in the UK and there is a potential opportunity in that regard for Ireland. I am interested to see whether Mr. Thomas-Symonds would be open to an Ireland-UK secondment programme, as we would be open to availing of a lot of that expertise.",
                "As we discussed, the veterinary agreement is something he should push for. This is stated chamber policy but it gives me an opportunity to re-emphasise it. The shared Ireland unit and fund have been a great success story. That has been very positive. I would love to see us building on it in terms of a similar model and fund based on an east-west approach between Ireland and the UK to maximise trade and engagement. There is an opportunity given the reset in relations. There is a potential opening there that the committee might just raise with Mr. Thomas-Symonds on whether that is something his Government might be open to.",

                "One of the issues I want to raise is the postponement of the TB checks and what has come in over this year and continues to come in. One of the issues companies exporting to Great Britain face, in particular in the agrifood area, is that a lot of the sales take place on what is called a deliver-to-UK basis. What that means is they deliver their goods to their customer, warehouse, or the large multiples in such a way that it is as if they were sourced in Great Britain. The Irish company takes care of all the associated costs involved in the export from Ireland and the import into Great Britain and the goods land with no requirement on the importer. That is a huge issue for Irish companies selling food products into the large multiples and warehouses in the UK. The difficulties that have come up in recent months as BTOM comes into effect is that in order to import into Great Britain, you need to be established, in effect, you need to have a company. If you cannot, you can get an indirect agent to act on your behalf, but it must take full liability for any costs, duties and impact and you will not get an agent to act in that way for obvious reasons. The only other option is to set up a company in Great Britain to act as the importer, and that is a huge cost to companies given what is involved in setting up a company from an establishment perspective - the staff, premises, and having all the documentation in place. There is an ancillary cost, which is not only the cost of the import, VAT, health certificates and SPS checks, but now we are looking at having another company operating in Great Britain. That is something that kind of fell out of the changes this year. Prior to this year, Irish companies had an exception whereby they could import into Great Britain much more freely.",

The Brexit vote and its potential outcomes for trade barriers, tariffs and misalignment of regulation was more than just a sleep disrupter. It had the potential to erode our business, put farm families out of business and damage the all-island economy. The Windsor Framework is working well. Lakeland's milk tankers cross the Border up to 100,000 times per year. The same tanker that collects milk from a farm in Newry will collect milk from a farm in Glaslough, County Monaghan, bring it to our plant in County Tyrone, take product from that and bring it to another plant for further processing. The seamless criss-crossing nature of North-South trade must be protected and the Windsor Framework is working well.",

There is one with the potential to be really damaging. Deputy Harkin has been a strong proponent of agriculture in the Border region and will be interested in this. It is the veterinary medicines issue. Right now veterinary products produced, certified and labelled in Britain can be used in Northern Ireland; from 1 January 2026, that will no longer be the case. That has the potential to remove between 30% and 50% of all medicines for animals, including companion animals and farm animals, from the NI market. What impact does that have? It is huge. We talk in southern Ireland of the impact the loss of the nitrates derogation would have on the agriculture industry. The lose of the veterinary medicines we have today would be like the derogation on steroids. It would have huge social, economic, animal health and, crucially, trade ramifications. Why do I say that? Some 2.5 billion litres are produced in Northern Ireland every year on farms. We are the largest purchaser of milk in Northern Ireland, about 1 billion litres. Some 30% of that milk comes south of the Border for processing. If vets in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are not comfortable with animal medicines used on farms in Northern Ireland, even though they are the exact same but just not certified, then where does that 30% of product go?"

There is strong support for the Windsor Framework. Over 95% of respondents to the survey back the framework as it stands. Our members said they appreciate the approach it takes to addressing the challenges posed by the Northern Ireland protocol and the compromises that had to be made in that sphere. Our members largely expressed optimism about the potential benefits of the Windsor Framework to their business. Some 73% viewed the arrangements as positive for their business. The sentiment is driven by the new customs arrangements, particularly the green and red lane system. The introduction of these lanes along with the trusted trader scheme represents a practical solution to streamline customs procedures and reduce the administrative burden on companies moving goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland.",
                "It is important to note the context in which it was agreed. The stakeholders noted and welcomed the broader opportunities that came with solving the protocol issue, especially the UK's admission to Horizon Europe, which was a major win for research and innovation and is as important for the Irish universities as for the British ones. Irish researchers overwhelmingly favour British research partners under these programmes. Overall, our members feel that, while it is not perfect, the Windsor Framework provides a workable solution to many of the wrinkles mentioned by my colleagues, fosters greater stability for businesses and customers and is essential for investment into Northern Ireland."

I remember as a Member of the European Parliament watching it being played out there and speaking not so much about the cost or geopolitical impact but about the thousands - probably hundreds of thousands - of hours that would be spent in committee meetings trying to sort it out and the cost of all of that. However, we are where we are and real progress has been made.",

That is massive. I am from a Border county and have raised at this committee the issue of the dairy industry. Milk coming from the North to the South is an integral part of the system. It is set up that way and would collapse if that did not happen. At the time, we were told things were working well - and they are - but there are huge challenges ahead with regard to the need for a comprehensive SPS veterinary agreement between the EU and the UK. Mr. Donohoe stated that the British say we probably do while the EU says \"No\" and that we must work within the Windsor Framework. What are the possibilities within the existing framework for dealing with some or all of the issues relating to veterinary medicines? Assuming it does not deal with them, do we need a new agreement? Is there the possibility for derogations or flexibility written into the framework? I am not au fait with all the detail. What is possible within the agreement?",

My experience is that the EU can be very sticky when it comes to regulation, and what is written is precisely what matters. One probably has this on both sides. Deputy Howlin already asked how Ireland, as an EU member state, can assist in this respect. What work can we do, as a committee or country, to smooth the pathway?",

Regarding a new framework and protocol, a review is due, but we are very conscious of the amount of water we had behind us in getting here and of not reopening matters. There is a big difference between dealing with a framework that is not operating as envisaged, or with some unexpected challenges, and renegotiating a new framework, which I do not think anybody has the appetite for. One thing we wanted from the get-go from the Northern Ireland protocol, and which would still apply, was the giving of greater strength and teeth to the joint committee that oversees it. Right now, it is just a matter of making sure the protocol is being fully implemented, whereas if the joint committee had greater strength and teeth, it would have a more dynamic response to some of the unforeseen challenges that have arisen. That would be the most pragmatic way forward; however, there is a different culture, perspective or outlook from the EU.",
                "Deputy Harkin has more experience than most in understanding that the EU, whatever else about it, is certainly a union of laws, rules and regulations. That said, there was a change of approach. Michel Barnier did much of the heavy lifting in the exit negotiations but Maroš Šefčovič, who is still in place, was far more pragmatic in finding solutions outside the box. That is what got us to where we are today, with the positive steps forward. We do not really want to open the whole thing again, go through all the battles again and have problems again but there are some identifiable issues that need to be addressed, as raised by Mr. Donohoe. To go back to what Deputy Howlin said regarding the review of the framework and putting something to Nick Thomas-Symonds, one could strengthen the joint committee on an ongoing by giving it some teeth.",
                "The common travel area is very different in terms of free movement. We are proudly and unequivocally in the customs union of the EU, and Ireland's position on that will not change. Obviously, there has to be a border somewhere when one of the countries is outside the EU but there are pragmatic approaches that we could take, as alluded to by Ms Lynch. In this regard, there is the question of whether companies need to be set up. The UK has control of its own customs policy entirely , so whatever Ireland can do under the European customs code is very different from what the UK can do. We have seen that so far in its approach, including through HMRC and Border Force.",

Things will be very difficult. I will not say both sides are entrenched but that there are different sides. They are on different sides in respect of what they believe is possible. As we know, politics is the art of the possible. A new agreement is critical. There are potential tweaks and suggestions of grandfather clauses and of using again what was in place before, but these do not seem to wash particularly well. To guarantee frictionless trade, the all-island economy and the integrity of trade, including international trade, given that we ultimately export 90% of everything we produce on farms today, we need the integrity to be upheld. It is a case of export or die, to use an old New Zealand expression. It is possible but it is a matter of clarity. We all talk about clarity and it is only the clarity that we want. If we were given clarity and told nothing could be done, we would be very annoyed, but we do need clarity to deliver a new SPS agreement. We met Baroness Hayman, the relevant Under-Secretary of State with responsibility for agriculture, in this regard and she was very keen and open. She is very proactive and informed on the matter. We need a new SPS agreement. Those concerned are far from confrontational but just on different sides or ends of the spectrum. It is incumbent on the agri-industry, Northern Ireland and southern Ireland to have this addressed. Crucially, and bearing in mind the considerable work that the chamber does, we would not be talking about the positivity associated with the Windsor framework if it were not for the collegiate, cross-party support we have here. That needs to be recognised as well. I am always positive, but I believe that, without addressing this, it will be very difficult."

                "When exporting from Ireland to Great Britain, or importing into Great Britain – this mirrors what happens with Great British companies importing into Ireland or elsewhere in the EU – the company has to lodge a customs declaration and account for its customs duties and its import VAT. If the products are food and agri products, the company has to get health certificates and be registered with the department. If selling in the UK, there will be another VAT point, along with complying with the UK rules for the specific products one is trading, as is similar with the EU. The regulatory requirements at the border can mount up, and that has become apparent to a large extent this year. The system was in place for European exporters and, as I have said, it has been in place for Great British importers into Ireland since Brexit kicked off. Irish companies had a derogation whereby they could choose, when their products arrived in Great Britain, not to lodge their customs declaration then but to do so within six months.",
                "I would say the rules with regard to whether a company should be established in the UK to act as importer were not applied with significant rigour. The health certificates have really only started to be introduced. That avalanche of regulation came into effect as the derogations for Irish exporters were removed. These issues have started to come to the fore as HMRC has become more active in auditing and as the rules have been applied more strictly.",
                "As Mr. Lynam said, the UK has the right now, as it is outside the EU, to apply the customs regulations within the context of the WTO rules, in its own manner. It is correct that we could not have a common travel area for goods. What I was suggesting was whether we could look at Irish companies, which export to the UK, establishing and having a UK company in place, or whether that could be resolved in some way. That is the particular regulatory issue for Irish companies.",
                "The reason for having that, as is the case in Europe, is that if you are not established in the territory and something goes wrong, such as the wrong customs duties, the wrong SPS requirements or the wrong VAT, who do you go after? In order to go after someone, to knock on the door, essentially you have to have the established company. However, that starts a tsunami of different requirements that are behind it, when you start to dig into it and ask, \"How do I import or export, if I am not established?\" and say, \"I will just get an agent.\" However, you realise that you cannot get an agent, so what happens next?"

That point is well made.",

Maybe we could get a summary of how things have gone since Brexit and the negotiation of the Windsor Framework as well. Have there been any significant changes in trade flows? The witnesses are not expected to have the information. We could probably get it somewhere else. However, I would be interested in anecdotal evidence of that.",

The witnesses mentioned the EU-UK specialised committee. In their experience, do they think that is working and that the committees are functioning and doing what they are supposed to do? I know there are various committees and it is quite complicated having regard to the various agreements but we can start with the EU-UK specialised committee.",

What are they doing in that regard and what is the feedback they are getting on that?"

We have been making the case for the benefits of the Northern Ireland Protocol, notwithstanding the concerns that we raised and the wrinkles that need to be ironed out. However, we will be supporting that but it is very important we depoliticise and de-dramatise that as much as possible and see it more as a procedural thing.

It is really only getting back into its flow now. That is specialised committees in energy and in various different avenues. We are starting to see it start to get up and running now. It probably needs a better level of communication between external bodies and specialised committees themselves. We are actively involved in the domestic advisory group to the European Commission. We would feed in our concerns directly to the specialised committees but more needs to be done there.",

What I am saying is putting the onus on ourselves in terms of the organisation giving better messaging to businesses based in the Republic and to businesses based in GB to also look to Northern Ireland before going more globally on it in terms of the investment opportunities for Irish businesses and British businesses in relation to Northern Ireland. I am putting the onus on myself.",

There has been significant growth in terms of trade between Northern Ireland and Ireland - €17 million or €18 million when we count in services. Again, in regard to east-west trade, the figures are kind of skewed in relation to some of the energy figures in terms of inflation. Generally, for the past couple of years, it has been on an upward trajectory. It depends on whether it is being assessed by the CSO or the UK Office for National Statistics. However, it has broken the €100 billion barrier in two-way trade."

First of all in regard to the work that has been done to attract inward investment into Northern Ireland, I was talking to my colleagues in BDO Belfast on this yesterday. It carried out a number of reports. In particular, there was quite a large report on prosperity in Northern Ireland, which was presented in the House of Commons and to the Tánaiste, Deputy Micheál Martin, pointing out the opportunities in Northern Ireland which are there to be availed of as the Windsor Framework has now set in. There is a significant amount of new US investment that has potential to come into Northern Ireland once the regulatory issues are settled.",
                "There is a great deal of work there as regards publicising that. It is a matter of trying to get that message out a little more internally in Ireland and looking at the structure and employment opportunities available in Northern Ireland to support that inward investment. There is definitely some work being done there that is achieving good traction.",
                "As regards the trade statistics, there has been a solid and really good result. Looking at trade statistics between the Republic of Ireland and Great Britain, there was certainly a belief that with Brexit initially there would be a significant reduction in imports and then, certainly from January or February of this year, with the changes in the UK as regards Irish exports, that we would have a significant reduction in exports to the UK. It is quite commendable to Irish exporters that this has not actually happened, that the work that has been done by Bord Bia, Enterprise Ireland, etc., in training and educating our exporters has really stood to them and that those challenges have been overcome. Notwithstanding the challenges I am raising as to what is coming down the line, we still have an issue with chemical exports, but I do not think that has anything to do with Brexit. As regards our food and agriculture side of things, those numbers have stayed constant. I do not have the actual details to hand, but that is at a high level."

There is a general conversation on misalignment and burden of regulation. I think Ms Lynch spoke about an avalanche.

When they got beyond just giving a report on the budget, they went into the fact that it is a taxation issue across the board and involves cross-Border workers, particularly remote working, and that many companies do not want to engage in this because of the hassle of setting up in another jurisdiction and all that goes with it. I imagine that would be an issue here as well. The witnesses have said not enough of the players have taken all this on board. As they say, that conversation is just not high enough on anyone's agenda. I suppose it is a matter of whatever role any of us can play, even given the timeline constraints within which we are operating. Mr. Lynam sees the joint committee, if it had teeth, as being something that could at least deal with some of this more dynamically. I think the only useful thing was using the example of Maroš Šefčovič as someone who was able to deal with and get around a number of issues. It is a matter of how disastrous we are talking about, how we get a framework in place and who the players who need to step up are. I imagine all this has to happen very quickly."

It would be the obvious thing while negotiating an SPS veterinary agreement, which can take some time. The difference is that, until a couple of years ago, the UK was effectively in the family; it was in the tent. This should not be as long and drawn out, as long as the principle of accepting dynamic alignment is put on the table by the UK and then the EU is willing to accept a fast-tracking of an agreement. They are easy solutions but hard to get to."

One thing I will put to the witnesses upfront is that they will continue to have the support of this committee, the Irish Government and everybody else. It is really important to recognise, however, that we are probably entering a very different phase of thinking by the European Union. What is happening is very welcome as to where the British Government will hopefully, in comparison with the previous Government, position itself. As regards one of the bigger problems we have to take on board, it is a matter of how we can work together collectively in our own country, but this is a Commission-UK issue. Deputy Howlin alluded to this earlier. As to where Europe is moving and what its thinking is, which is very much on the other side of Europe and relates to accession, security and so on, it is reshaping, though, the way in which it will approach discussions it has with the UK and so on. It is the impact, as the EU will feel it, for other discussions with other countries in other ways that will shape its thinking.",
                "Dynamic alignment is particularly important. As we have all talked about here, there are two things involved. The first is that Europe is built on regulations and the second is that, as Mr. Lynam correctly said in his opening statement, there is definitely an attitude within the Commission, and Mr. Šefčovič is a very progressive person in that regard, but even he would hold that if you are not a member of the club and you chose to leave the club, you cannot then turn around and say you want the full benefits of the club. If that were to be conceded by Europe, the problem for the latter would then be why anybody else should join the club or why the existing players should stay in if they can have everything they want. That is at the crux of it, and we will get caught up in that. It will be a more difficult argument in terms of the veterinary agreement than we probably realise, although I am sure the witnesses are at the coalface of this do realise that. However, that will be a major problem. I agree that the complications and consequences for Ireland of it going wrong will be pretty staggering."

On Deputy Howlin's point, the starting point is that we were talking about the EU position being dynamic alignment for a veterinary agreement. Should the UK concede that, and that is a big if, the advocacy would be in terms of fast-tracking such a veterinary agreement. Those are big ifs and buts. We do, however, have some level of precedent contained within the trade and co-operation agreement, when the negotiating position was dynamic alignment versus mutual recognition, based on key principled positions as to how we got the trade and co-operation agreement as regards goods. It will have to be much stronger than that in terms of agrifood SPS because of the sensitivity of the product. I totally accept that. I am just making the point that a veterinary agreement is in everyone's interests, but I completely accept that the UK would have to cede something as regards dynamic alignment or something very close to it. However, that is standard enough in terms of veterinary agreements. Different models exist, and the closer you get and the more integrated you get, the closer the UK will have to go to as regards dynamic alignment.",

We have that with New Zealand and Switzerland, for example."

Those posts were made obsolete by the stroke of a pen last December. That has a huge effect on nursing and midwifery because it usually takes approximately six months to recruit a nurse. Members can imagine that if we carried vacancies for six months in 2023 and had vacant posts in December 2023 and the HSE decides that the posts cannot be filled in 2024 and that they will not be funded in 2024, that will have a massive effect on our services.",
                "The recruitment as set out by the HSE in the numbers does not take into account the calibration of a whole-time equivalent post and its difference in 2022. In July 2022, nursing and midwifery hours were reduced from 39 hours per week to 37.5 hours per week. However, the number of whole-time equivalent posts remained the same. In other words, the hours loss was not recalibrated. We estimate that there are approximately 1,700 whole-time equivalent posts, when it is translated into hours. We referred that to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, as a dispute and had a conciliation hearing in May 2024. We then met the census division of the HSE, which confirmed that one whole-time equivalent post in July 2022 was calculated to be the same as one whole-time equivalent post calculated at the end June. In other words, no provision was made for the loss of nursing hours.",
                "Members might recall that the loss was covered by a national pay agreement and that €150 million was made available by the State to replace the hours lost due to the reduction in working time. The pay and numbers strategy must take into account the recalibration and must be based on the actual number of whole-time equivalent posts. Since 2022, the total growth in net nursing is 547 whole-time equivalent posts. We know this. We have two directors of nursing, our president, Caroline Gourley, who is a director of nursing in care of the older person services and Neil Dunne, who is a director of public health nursing in Dublin, and they can give examples of how the real front-line shortage is affecting services. I have examples. We surveyed our members in recent months and it is clear to us that there is now a huge issue with waiting lists being introduced in, for example, cancer services and nursing-led services, such as children's services, that did not exist. As one might expect, all the services are affected when we are trying to develop community services. They simply will not happen.",
                "The regional health areas have now been established and each of the CEOs has been advised of their budgets. They have not been advised that certain funds, for example, the funding for the framework on nursing and healthcare assistant safe staffing, which was indicated and agreed to be necessary for the maintenance of safe services in acute hospitals, is not protected. In other words, it may or may not happen, depending on the funding that is available. We are told that funding is interchangeable when we meet the regional health areas. In other words, they can decide what post to fill based on the financial allocation they have received and not on the agreements to maintain safe staffing. That is a huge problem because our members went on strike in 2019 to ensure they would have a mechanism to determine safe staffing and that rug has now simply been pulled out from under them.",
                "The current situation is that this year the HSE will not protect any funding for agreements it has brokered on staffing. We also know that the recalibration of the whole-time equivalent hours has not happened. We have a real concern that by placing caps on recruitment, we will score the biggest own goal the country has ever scored, because research now indicates that in 2007 when the last moratorium was introduced, nursing and midwifery suffered the most. It took us until the middle of 2020 to recover the numbers we had in 2007 and that was done by going to all corners of the globe to recruit, because at that point many of our own graduates decided to leave because they were not offered posts due to the moratorium. We are in exactly the same position today. We are imposing caps and refusing to allow recruitment. It is the wrong move.",
                "If the committee has any authority to influence that thinking, we argue that there must now be a system whereby the decision about recruitment is taken away from the financial control of the HSE and Department of Health and based on safety for patients. HIQA must be given the authority under the patient safety (licensing) Bill, which has not been enacted, but the heads of the Bill were published in 2018. We have a list of HIQA inspections I can share, but I am sure members of the committee know them well. All the inspections HIQA has done in the past five years in various acute hospitals point to the fact they are not staffed properly. However, there is nothing it can do about it. It can merely report on it. We want it to have the authority and we are asking the committee to ensure that section of the patient safety (licensing) Bill is enacted. It is imperative that patient safety is measured, not by the amount of money available but by the number of staff required and scientifically determined to provide safety.",
                "From the good research conducted into nurse staffing and patient safety, we know that when the staffing numbers are correct, patient mortality improves, the length of stay reduces, readmission reduces and agency costs also reduce. It makes sense. Already this year we are spending more than €500,000 more on agency staff per month, which defeats the purpose of any moratorium. We estimate that by the end of the year, we will have spent just over €26 million more on nursing and midwifery alone than in 2023. It makes no sense. We should be recruiting and directly hiring. The premise on which the caps are imposed is very damaging to patients and retention. It will increase burnout. Already the number of assaults on front-line staff is increasing and that is always directly connected to the number of staff on duty. Furthermore, development of community services will stall. It will simply not happen.",
                "If committee members want to ask us about any issues, I am happy to take any questions."

I am SIPTU’s sector organiser with national responsibility for support grades in the health division. I am accompanied by my colleague Aideen Carberry, who is the division’s communications officer; and our colleague Ms Deborah Kelleher, who is a radiation therapist. In the Gallery, we are joined by Sean Murray, Clara Cremin and Olivia Brereton, who are activists in our union.",
                "On behalf of SIPTU’s health division, we welcome the invitation to meet the committee today. Our division represents over 41,000 members within both public and private settings. Our membership includes the widest scope of grades within the health service including health professionals, health care assistants, psychiatric nurses, support staff grades and the National Ambulance Service. Our union is a strong voice within the ICTU staff panel of health unions and the health service union representatives on the national joint council.",
                "We have provided a detailed submission to the committee which seeks to highlight key issues for our members regarding staffing levels within the public health system. We have broken our submission into the following sections: a background to the recruitment embargo and subsequent suppression of posts; the need for safe staffing levels for all grades and departments within our public health service - currently figures and staffing levels are based on historical data; how insufficient staffing impacts the expansion of services within the public health service; a look at the HSE’s own employment census data; some case studies regarding staffing for SIPTU grades; and results and context of a recent survey conducted by SIPTU, demonstrating our members’ views on the recruitment embargo and subsequent suppression of posts.",
                "Our union has chosen these topics for discussion within our submission. They broadly represent the views of our membership and the issues they face daily in relation to staffing concerns within the HSE. While our submission goes into details of our members' concerns, we wish to highlight a few keys observations for today’s hearing.",
                "On the safe staffing framework, SIPTU contends that every department should have an established framework for safe staffing levels to meet the requirements expected of them. Currently most rosters are derived from historical information. It is our view that staffing levels should be measured to address the daily needs of the department and to ensure patient safety, but also to absorb the reality that the health service workforce has responsibilities outside of the workplace.",
                "In relation to existing staffing levels, our members do not feel any relief coming from the increases identified in the national health sector budgets. Their concerns in relation to staffing levels are borne out in the HSE's own census figures, as outlined in a table we have supplied. In our view, the HSE’s own data demonstrate that despite talk of record levels of investment, many grades and services have not benefited from this investment and our members do not feel that investment on the ground. For example, in the last 18 months only an additional 19 whole-time equivalents have been recruited out of a total of 10,208 support staff. Despite growing demand for home care services, we are actually down 84 whole-time equivalent health care support assistants in the same period.",
                "We note that National Ambulance Service management publicly stated in February 2023 that the service would need to more than double its staffing to deal with the unprecedented demands on the service. We note that according to the HSE’s own data, the number of whole-time equivalents employed by the NAS only increased by 140 from December 2022 to August 2024, an increase of just under 7%.",
                "We have previously highlighted that our health services have a 30% shortage of radiation therapists and this is leading to increased delays in cancer treatments. This staffing crisis has led to at least four cancer treatment machines not being utilised. These machines could treat around 30 patients a day, meaning there may be as many as 120 cancer patients who are not being dealt with daily due to staffing deficits. The recommendations of the national radiation therapist review report need to be implemented in full and without delay to develop a safe staffing model for radiation therapy and address the staffing deficits. SIPTU is not disputing the increased numbers in employment within the HSE. However, we believe that some grades have benefited to a greater extent than other grades which also provide vital services to communities. An increase of just three radiation therapists has been approved in the last 18 months.",
                "I now turn to agency spend. In addition to the above concerns, agency spend is still increasing. The total agency spend in 2023 was €647 million. In 2024, for the first five months of the year, agency spend was up 10% to €288 million. Only a small number of posts within SIPTU-represented grades are identified to be secured via the agency conversion programme proposed by the HSE. The embargo prevented the recruitment of direct staff to offset the need for agency usage, even though it would be cheaper to do so. The increased use of agency staff and contractors to provide essential health services presents a risk to the State. In addition, announcements on additional home care hours are made without the HSE having available resources to provide them, which means they end up being provided by the private sector.",
                "On health service demand, both the HSE and the Department of Health confirmed at the Joint Committee on Health on 18 September 2024 that there have been significant increases in demand for services. It is also recognised that there is significant demand on health services arising from population growth of over 11% since 2016. The HSE confirmed at last month's hearing that 2024 will see the highest level of activity ever within the public health system. To meet that demand, the Department of Health informed this committee that since 2021, emergency department presentations are up 29% and day cases are up 20%. The HSE is now delivering 4 million outpatient appointments, up 800,000 since 2021. Inroads are being made on waiting lists. Our members are behind those figures. They are working harder now than ever before and it is their view that any policy for the staffing of services within the HSE must take account of the expansion of services.",
                "Previous attempts to introduce an extended working day failed because of the HSE and the Department of Health not investing in their staff. It is frankly irrelevant how many staff of another grade have been employed if they are required in an area such as diagnostics, catering, home care, portering or the NAS. To demonstrate the fact that the pay and numbers strategy may be undermining extended working days, we might look at diagnostic services. Within our 52 diagnostic departments, only 34 additional staff have been processed in the last 18 months. That is less than one per diagnostic centre across the country and in an overall headcount total of 1,527. It is important to note that a nine-to-five roster equates to a 40-hour week, whereas moving to an eight-to-eight, seven-day roster involves an 84-hour period. An extended working day requires more staff. It is not possible for staff who are already working in depleted areas and have not benefited from the increase in staffing numbers promoted by the HSE and the Department of Health to be expected to move to an 84-hour roster. Our members are already struggling to cover the nine-to-five regime with additional on-site, on-call or overtime requirements.",
                "In summary, modern healthcare is a multidisciplinary effort. Many grades of staff interact with a patient during their treatment. Unfortunately, a lot of focus is spent on improving some areas of the service while little is spent on many others. It is for this reason that SIPTU contends that every department should have a safe staffing level determined to match the service demand required of them. Such a safe staffing level should incorporate issues such as the number of patients, acuity levels, speciality areas and hours or days of service, among other issues. The necessary staffing resources should then be made available to support the safe delivery of service. We have provided more detailed information on this in our submission. We look forward to the engagement with the committee today and are happy to answer any questions."

It did not matter, as there was no differentiation. The Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland has now produced figures which can differentiate between bedside and other work, so the OECD figures for the future will probably be better.

That means that any new posts we would have gotten are now obsolete, so that is going to exacerbate the current situation.

It is deeply disappointing to hear that although the embargo has been lifted, strict controls on recruitment are still in place. These constraints not only limit our capacity to expand services and meet the rising demands of healthcare; they also take a severe toll on the mental and physical well-being of front-line workers. That is the aspect about which I am concerned.",
                "During our discussion on 18 September, there was considerable focus on time, including maximising the time we invest, average waiting times and timeframes for achieving targets. However, rarely do we address the time healthcare workers dedicate to caring for others, often at the expense of time spent with loved ones and, in particular, caring for themselves. It is not surprising that in the annual INMO survey, not one respondent rated staff morale as excellent. It says an awful lot that 70% felt their work impacts on their physical health and 41% said it negatively affects their psychological well-being. I ask the witnesses to expand a little on that. It is often the biggest issue. We forget about the impact of all of this on front-line workers.",

Are there any statistics on this? Perhaps that should be a factor in workplace planning, especially at a time when recruitment is so tightly restricted.",

I never forgot that, and I often wondered how that nurse coped and survived."

It is money that could be used to address the terms and conditions of employment of directly employed staff, invest in and build on services and support the roll-out of the community functions we are all on board with. The choice being taken at the moment is about how to contract or outsource and not increase headcount. That is the challenge for our members.

They are actually retiring early. That means they do not see their future in the health service because they cannot work in that situation. As an example, I will give the committee a comment from one of our members who works in one of the busy Dublin charity hospitals. The hospital had 8,500 births but is only staffed for 5,500 births. It is impossible to keep going to work and feel protected. Assaults on nurses and midwives have increased from 3,465 in 2023 to well over 4,000 in the first half of this year alone. That is not a service. An employer can say it has an employee assist programme, which was one of the questions asked, but that is after you are assaulted. Employees can then have a phone call with a counsellor. We want preventative measures, not post-event measures. Intention to leave was way too high among public health nurses and community general nurses we surveyed recently. It is a combination of poor staffing levels and the focus not being on safety.",

When places are staffed properly, nurses and midwives are drawn to those areas. They want to work in those locations and they stay working in those locations."

The child was there a number of weeks in Crumlin hospital with the parents sharing the room with two other children because they could not get an MRI. Thankfully, the child has got that MRI. There were other difficulties in that case as well. An anaesthetist was needed because of the pain the child was going through. That puts things in context.",

Will she tell the committee where those machines are not operating at the moment? We heard for years there were two machines in, for example, Tullamore hospital, with one of them not being used. A few years ago, the Minister, when was asked before on the issue of scoliosis in relation to Crumlin hospital, said he was going to get an additional machine to help with the backlog. Will Ms Kelleher give us a sense as to where those machines are down?",

We hear all the time about the amount of money that is being spent on the health service, but it is almost like we are spending more money to stand still. There is huge money, but also huge gaps in this regard. Our population, as the witness said in her own contribution, has grown. Thankfully, we have a young population. We also have an older population who, we know from the statistics, are staying longer in hospital. The reality is we are faced with those challenges, which are positive ones for society, given that people are living longer. We have to back that up, however. We say all the time that these are the people who built the economy and we need to look after them. That is the general consensus of everyone. We do not, however, have the staff to do it. When we throw out all these figures, people do not really understand them. If a nurse is missing on a particular ward, who fills that gap? That is the big challenge.",
                "Ms Ní Sheaghdha mentioned the number of assaults. If someone is waiting for a long time, the tension that arises, particularly in an emergency department, is understandable, and I am not excusing such behaviour. We do not have the services within the community because we know for a fact the community services, or many of the key members of them, are missing, so people cannot get those services. We are told the best place for people to be is in their own home, but people cannot get the services in their home. A number of steps must be taken. While trying to fix this is not rocket science, the impression at home is that this is impossible. There has been reference to the Department of Health as \"Angola\" and the question has arisen of who would want to work in it. A lot of staff want to work in it. They see the wastage and the challenges. The biggest frustration when talking to members of the witnesses’ union is that they see that this can be fixed with not a huge amount of money or anything else. If there is a moratorium on jobs, those jobs are obsolete. It then takes six months to fill them, which creates a gap and means you are falling behind. I can understand the frustration of people wanting to get out of the service to go abroad and get into a service which works and provides a better quality of life. The message we need to be sending, as a committee, is that these people are doing really positive work and we want them to continue.",

The machine closures are standard as well, with one closure in each corner of the country. We have recently just completed a national review of radiation therapy services, which has 16 recommendations. Many of those recommendations are very easy and cost-effective to implement. It is just about getting those accepted by the Department of Health and implemented in a timely manner. They would make big differences in terms of staffing, attrition rates and reopening services.",
                "We also need to get those clinical tutor posts in. We need to start at the basics. Getting students into college places is essential to get the services up and running. That is a quick fix. We have only 12 radiation therapists being trained in UCC annually in a postgraduate programme. That is a two-year programme. There are only 30 places in Trinity College Dublin. It is easy to boost those numbers quickly and cost-effectively. We have amazing infrastructure in the country for radiation oncology services and phenomenal services in all parts of the country. Leaving them sitting there idle is the biggest curse to the country when we have such high rates of cancer. One in two of us will be affected by cancer in our lifetime. They are stark figures. First and foremost, opening up places to students and looking after our radiation therapist students would be a good start. Unfortunately, we were not successful within the health and social care professions group. We did not get any additional places this year. We seem to have been omitted from that pot this year and I do not really understand why when we have clearly stated that lifesaving cancer services are closed. Implementing the recommendations of the review would be a good start."

                "Public health nursing is geographically based, meaning that when there is a vacancy, there is a community without a nurse. You will often see that. There has been advocacy at TD level regarding communities with no public health nurse. Public health nurse recruitment is once per year through the student public health nursing programme and it did not reach its potential this year. The circumstances are even more worrying for next year. Currently, there are only 21 registered public health nurse vacancies within the system. That is extremely concerning. We have spaces to train 140 per year. When there is no nurse in an area like south inner-city Dublin, nurses must cross-cover, and that is when burnout arises. It means no patient- or family-centred relationship. We do not get to work upstream in circumstances where we need to work on the preventive side. Early contact with families and children on referrals is really important to later outcomes. Therefore, trying to protect the clinical workforce is so important, and that is obviously the job of the committee today. There is a particular challenge within community nursing or public health nursing services.",

However, we do not have that balance, and we do not have a model of care for public health nursing either.

That department has informed us it was down a further three staff since January, which means it is now down eight staff. In the 18 months from January 2023 to July 2024, we have had an increase of 34 staff within the 52 diagnostic centres. That is the scale of the challenge facing us.

The WHO has advised Ireland that it needs to recruit ethically. In other words, it has to grow its domestic supply of healthcare workers to avoid poaching – this is the term used – from countries that need their own workforces but that are poorer and whose healthcare workers consequently migrate. We are now heavily dependent on non-EU workers, particularly in nursing. Our population of Indian nurses has grown significantly. The WHO has given us a target for recalibration by 2030. We have to ensure we train domestically so as not to rob countries that need their own healthcare workforces of those workforces. This means that, by the period 2030 to 2035, we should, if following what the WHO has stipulated, be training over 7,000. We are training about 2,100 at the moment.",

We do not have a chance of achieving this with a postgraduate course that produces about 140 public health nurses every year. The training happens only once a year, meaning that if you do not fill your places, you do not get a second chance. Community general nurses advise that postgraduate education has not been provided for them, specifically in respect of the community. It is an ask that dates back over a decade. Many of the nurses tell us they must sometimes cover two roles when health nurses are not available. Clearly, there are not enough public health nurses employed.",
                "Overall, the HSE is too reliant on nurses in training. We met student nurses again last week. Senator Black asked what makes nurses want to stay. It is heartening to see students with enthusiasm for the career they have chosen but they tell us they are being absolutely exploited. They are on no pay, working in clinical placements and given responsibilities they should not be given. It is not even that they are low paid because, from first year through to third year, they get no pay at all. When they are in fourth year, for 36 weeks they get 80% of the pay at the first point of the qualified nurse salary. We saw during the Covid pandemic that the exploitation of unpaid labour, particularly of those in the student nurse grade, was just extraordinary, and that is still going on.",

It is good, the evidence is there, and we all know that, but our system, our overwork and the exploitative nature of short-staffing means they make decisions not to stay. That is fixable. That is easily fixable."

I do not know where that is coming from, whether it is at a political level or at a senior level within the Department of Health or the Department of Public Expenditure, NDP Delivery and Reform. The level of outsourcing at the moment is shocking. The point has been made already that it results in poorer terms of employment. It also results in considerable profits being taken out of the health service, money that should be used for the provision of front-line services. That has to be ideological. There is no doubt that in recent times there has been an acceleration in that. It absolutely flies in the face of the principles underpinning an effective public health service and what was agreed on a cross-party basis in relation to Sláintecare.",

There has to be a responsibility at Government level for that huge push. We used to talk about creeping privatisation. It is more like galloping privatisation in the health service now.

The service has to be provided when people are in long-term care. Obviously, that has to happen then. It was not today nor yesterday, as members know, when Sláintecare did its review. In this year's budget, I was reading yesterday, the allocation is to maintain the HIQA standard, which means actually to reduce beds in the public sector. Single and double occupancy rooms - changing away from the old buildings we had - have actually reduced significantly. However, 82% of long-term care is now provided through the private sector."

With privatisation nationally in the country, when nursing homes close, which they can do due to HIQA, we then have to source beds within the public area for those patients. It is very difficult. As Ms Ní Sheaghdha already alluded to, HSE accommodation is all multiple occupancy. People do not want to share anymore. Covid-19 had a huge impact on whether people shared rooms. They now want single rooms. The majority of beds within the public sector need refurbishment. They need to be changed. To meet the service need, we need about 10,000 long-term beds in the public service. Therefore, it has all been outsourced."

I can guarantee that, because of the age profile and the demographics, it is not the older person in their own home that gets priority. We do not have the home supports and the staff do not like making that choice. They are not providing the service our residents and the people require, nor are they providing the ultimate service they themselves want to provide. Staff are leaving, but they are also going home at night-time worrying that somebody does not have a situation. They could have somebody with dementia at home. I had a case recently where a woman fell. She was the main carer for her husband who had dementia and her son who had special needs. She lay on the floor for two days because she would not go anywhere because nobody could mind her husband and her child. We eventually got a place for them and sorted out care for them. That is the ultimate of what is happening in the community. The staff are not able to take it on anymore. They are leaving in their droves, as Ms Ní Sheaghdha said."

It is simply a case of describing the expenditure differently. We would prefer if there was not a ceiling. We want to reach safety-measured staffing levels without being as reliant on agency staff. We know this works because when we did a pilot study in 2020 on the framework on nurse staffing, agency expenditure reduced significantly once sufficient numbers were hired to meet requirements. Where we had a requirement for one nurse for four patients or one nurse for six patients and that number was funded and employed, agency expenditure dropped significantly. This information is available through the Department of Health. It is part of the framework for nurse staffing and skills mix."

However, that changed when the pay and numbers strategy was introduced. What has happened is that the six regions have each been allocated a sum of money and they must determine what posts they will fill based on the money that is available. Some have advised us that the total across all grades would be in or around 260 posts for one region. However, we know that, in that location alone, there are about 400 vacancies in nursing and midwifery. It does not make any sense not to look at what is required to provide the required patient safety levels. We have measured that requirement and the Government has accepted our measurement. In fact, the Government and the Department of Health initiated that study. They know what is required. When that does not translate to protections for those posts, it is a futile exercise."

When you go to work and you have correct numbers on your roster that are safe, that is a different scenario entirely. We know this to be true because there is evidence from where that exists. In California, New South Wales and other states in Australia, they have introduced staffing ratios and they are mandated by legislation to ensure they can never not do it, and then their retention is much improved.",

It is because the workload, as Mr. Dunne said, the nursing measurement, is based on a 1966 circular. To be eligible for public health nursing services, you have to have a medical card or have that status bestowed on you by the Minister. In reality, that figure has gone far beyond what the measurement of public health nurses was based on so it is not possible to provide any service.

For diabetics, urology patients and the people who need the care, people who are going to be with us for the rest of their lives and our work lives very often, we just cannot provide that service with the current challenges in recruitment.

What is needed is the community RGN to be able to step up to that. There is no science yet. We do not have safe staffing within that, like in the acute hospitals.

If the Deputy is asking what is the main issue, I would say simply it is the cap and not giving the front-line clinicians who know where the gaps and vacancies are permission to recruit. That has become a bureaucratic nightmare. It takes about six months to get through that process.

It does the opposite of what is intended. When you put a moratorium in place, you will increase your agency costs because people still turn up at the hospital and they have to be cared for. They still require services in the community. It is not an option. The problem I think everybody needs to focus on is that we have a growing population. Our needs in the health service are increasing. We only have to look at the Government's own figures and projections.

If we do not have those services or supports - whether it involves elderly people, young people or young mothers who have just had a child, all of which supports need to kick in - there will be a gap in services and it is the same in acute services.",
                "We tried today to focus on the nursing aspects of this whole area. If we have time and if there is enough space in the work programme, we certainly hope to return to this issue again. I thank the witnesses on behalf of the committee for coming in and giving their valuable insight into the challenges facing their members. I thank the INMO and SIPTU for assisting the committee in its consideration of staffing levels in the HSE, especially in the area of nursing. Again, I thank the witnesses. This morning was very useful."

                "A Cheann Comhairle, is onóir dom é buiséad 2025 a thíolacadh, buiséad deireanach théarma an Rialtais seo, don Teach seo inniu in éineacht le mo chomhghleacaí, an tAire, an Teachta Donohoe.",
                "INTRODUCTION",
                "When this Government took office in June 2020, we were still dealing with Brexit and in the midst of a global pandemic that was having an unprecedented impact on our society and economy. The effect on families, businesses and our way of living was devastating. While only emerging from that pandemic, we were then confronted with the war in Ukraine and the cost-of-living pressures.",
                "This Government, through successive budgets, has supported the individuals, families and businesses who have played an integral part in ensuring our economy is in such a strong position today. Government responded as it should have with a unity of purpose and provided extraordinary supports to deal with all the challenges we faced. The outcomes and the progress made were not inevitable. It is as a result of the drive and focus of this Government to provide a better future for everyone and in the careful management of our public finances. I believe budget 2025 puts in place the policies and measures to continue this positive trajectory and ensure that all our people see a promising and hopeful future in this country.",
                "Today’s budget is my first and it is also unique in the opportunity it presents to plan, transform and deliver for the future. That future is not just about next month, next year or the next decade, it is about ensuring that the children born today in Ireland and every day from here on can live prosperous and fulfilled lives. They will enjoy better healthcare, live longer, have better education, more housing and significant infrastructure improvements as a result of the decisions made today. However, we also need to give hope to young people now and to their families, their parents and grandparents whether living here in Ireland or abroad that the decisions being made today will help them afford a home of their own and live a life here in Ireland achieving their full potential. Budget 2025 puts the country on a firm footing for the future.",
                "Progressivity, fairness and catalysing real opportunity for the future have been at the core of this Government’s budgets and these principles have been central to how budget 2025 has been designed. Strengthening communities, building prosperity, tackling the cost-of-living challenges and enhancing living standards are all key components to build a better State that can make a real difference for the people of Ireland. We want our country to be an attractive place to live in, work in, raise a family, and create jobs and opportunity - a foundation of real progress for the future.",
                "INFRASTRUCTURE AND INVESTMENT",
                "Our ability to deliver for current and future generations is dependent on careful and prudent management of the State’s resources. The recent judgment from the Court of Justice of the European Union has provided the State with one-off revenue that has the capacity to be transformational. We know that the future economic performance of the State will depend on how the public infrastructure programme is prioritised and delivered over the next decade. It is imperative that this revenue is not used for day-to-day expenditure or to narrow the tax base. There should be a clear strategic direction in how it can be used to deliver for the future of our country, improving the lives of people and communities, and supporting our small and medium enterprises and multinational corporations.",
                "Today, I will outline a framework that will set out the principles and directions on how this revenue should be allocated in a manner that will maximise its return. It is the Government’s view that we should utilise these revenues to address the known challenges that we face in housing, energy, water and transport infrastructure. Our economic, enterprise and industrial model is central to future progress. It has transformed our country from where we were 100 years ago. We must protect it. We must nurture it. We must continue to advance this model as a catalyst to support the transformation of our country, ensuring opportunities for the future. We will invest in a future that ensures Ireland is a country and a society that is fair, equitable and a beacon of hope, prosperity and progress.",
                "We are in a global environment where competition for attracting foreign investment is intensifying. Infrastructure is a fundamental component of Ireland’s competitiveness, and is vital to businesses, large and small, and to attracting new foreign direct investment into the State. Maintaining our competitiveness and having the means to improve it are vital to maintaining employment in all sectors of our economy, no matter where those jobs are located.",
                "The framework for allocation of the windfall receipts should be based on a number of high-level principles and parameters, but the guiding principle must be to benefit all citizens by supporting our future economic development.",
                "The development of the framework will help ensure the maximum rate of return, both from an economic and societal perspective, from this once-off resource which can further complement the national development plan.",
                "The Departments of Finance, and Public Expenditure, NDP Delivery and Reform, will build out this framework, with input from other relevant Departments and agencies. This will focus on the expected considerations for public investment in key infrastructure, including: deliverability; value for money; additionality; and prioritisation for economic impact. That work will begin now, with the target to bring the framework to Government for approval in the first quarter of next year.",
                "The recent disposal of part of the State’s shareholding in AIB has presented us with an immediate opportunity to allocate additional funding towards capital spending over the coming years. To this end, today, I am making available €3 billion for infrastructure spending. This will help build on current progress, eliminating key infrastructural bottlenecks more rapidly, and help lay the foundations for further improvements in living standards and competitiveness. Deciding on the use of these resources requires prioritisation and it is important that their use results in tangible outputs.",
                "I recognise that there are substantial needs in housing, but also in water and energy infrastructure that need to be addressed. Investment in these areas will allow us to meet the current and future needs of our country. To that end, I intend that these resources will be ring-fenced and drawn down when the funding is required and the necessary arrangements are in place to use it.",
                "WATER INFRASTRUCTURE",
                "In terms of addressing water infrastructure, €1 billion will be provided to Irish Water for non-domestic capital investment. This will allow for works to be carried out across the country on capital projects related to remedial action lists, connections for new housing and addressing urban wastewater pressures.",
                "HOUSING",
                "This Government has invested unprecedented levels into housing delivery and it is our priority to continue to accelerate the supply of new homes.",
                "To support this, a further allocation of €1.25 billion will be made available to the Land Development Agency, LDA. This will bring the total amount of funding now available to the agency to €6.25 billion to deliver thousands of more affordable homes. The LDA will be tasked with deploying this capital in a way that can continue to drive the delivery of social and affordable homes.",
                "ELECTRICITY GRID INFRASTRUCTURE",
                "Confidence in our ability to provide a secure, stable and green energy infrastructure is important to position Ireland for future economic development and investment. To address this, I am also providing €750 million to facilitate an initial, direct equity injection to support capital spending on the further development of our electricity grid infrastructure. The upgrading of this key element of our national infrastructure will be instrumental in ensuring our economy is ready for the next phase of its development. Providing a secure, sustainable source of energy will encourage further industrial investment, facilitate the progression of the digital economy, enable decarbonisation and enhance our competitiveness. The upgrading of the national electricity grid will require capital investment in both the onshore and offshore grid. I believe the signalling of the provision of this funding to expand the capacity of our electricity grid will have a positive impact on future investment decisions currently being considered by both indigenous and multinational companies.",
                "In the event of further AIB share sales, I will seek to provide further funding to these critical infrastructure areas of water, housing and the electricity grid to underpin our future economic development. With this level of investment in the future, it is important to reflect on where we have come from. In the century since independence, Ireland has grown more tolerant, more diverse, more prosperous, more equal and more influential around the world. We need to keep building prosperity for the future. The measure of our success is how we treat people, how we turn the tide of our economic success into a force that lifts everyone, especially those who need our help the most. We can appreciate our achievement as a country more because of the generations at home who have had to struggle for it but we should not forget the people who struggle still. It is our responsibility to help because we can and we will.",
                "MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK",
                "I will now provide an update on the macroeconomic outlook. I am pleased to report that our economy, on aggregate, is in relatively good shape. Over the past year or so, inflationary pressures have eased considerably, our domestic economy has grown at a robust pace and we continue to experience record high levels of employment. Indeed, our economy has now been operating close to, if not at, full employment since the end of the pandemic. Almost three quarters of our working-age population are now in employment, with participation among female workers at its highest level ever. This is a truly remarkable achievement and one we should properly recognise.",
                "The rate of inflation, which was close to 10% just two years ago, has eased significantly this year. Inflation has been at or below 2% since March. This easing comes as welcome relief to households throughout the country who have dealt with everyday financial struggles due to rising prices over the past two years. Even as the headline rate of inflation has declined, I am acutely aware that many are still struggling as price levels throughout the economy remain elevated. That is why budget 2025 includes a cost-of-living package designed to support the most vulnerable and ease the financial burden over the winter months.",
                "It is clear that supply is the main constraint on growth at present. That is why it is imperative that we can continue to narrow the infrastructure gap and improve the productive capacity of the economy. The Government recognises the need to invest in our future and support our competitiveness in the years to come. As part of budget 2025, we are investing at scale to address these bottlenecks and put in place long-term solutions to ensure a more sustainable, productive and resilient economy.",
                "Budget 2025 is taking place against a backdrop of escalating international conflict and geopolitical instability. Our experience over the last number of years has shown that we are now clearly living in a more shock prone world. As a small, open and highly globalised economy, a deterioration in the international economy would, of course, have immediate knock-on consequences for the Irish economy. While we cannot prevent external shocks, we can ensure that we are on the best possible footing to respond when they occur. Within this context, budget 2025 has been designed to strike the right balance between ensuring families, workers and businesses have the supports they need today while also investing in our public services and infrastructure to prepare us for the challenges into the future.",
                "While external risks remain elevated, the short-term prospects for the domestic economy are encouraging. The period of elevated price pressures has passed and inflation has now returned to a more stable trajectory. This easing in inflation, which is projected to remain below 2% both this year and next, will allow for an improvement in real wages and help support growth in consumer spending.",
                "Overall, my Department is projecting modified domestic demand, a proxy for the domestic economy, to grow by 2.5% this year and by close to 3% next year. The strong growth in the domestic economy is expected to continue to pay dividends in the labour market. Indeed, the level of employment is set to increase by almost 110,000 in the two-year period to the end of 2025 and the unemployment rate is projected to remain low at around 4.5%. My Department’s macroeconomic forecasts have been endorsed by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.",
                "FISCAL OUTLOOK",
                "As outlined, the Irish economy is very strong on a headline level. However, there are real vulnerabilities in our public finances and these must be kept in mind when constructing a budgetary package. We know that our public finances are heavily reliant on corporation tax, much of which is windfall in nature and not linked to our domestic economy. Many of our income tax receipts are linked with this highly concentrated revenue stream. As I have said many times before, we must not use these potentially transient receipts to fund permanent expenditure measures.",
                "At this stage, we are all familiar with the structural challenges we have already started to face, namely, an ageing population, the climate and digital transitions and deglobalisation. We know that we are facing substantial costs on all of these fronts, not to mind the unknown challenges ahead. We must ensure that the budgetary decisions we make today continue to place us in a better position to deal with these issues.",
                "This year, my Department forecasts tax revenue will amount to €105.7 billion, an increase of €13.6 billion on our spring forecast, mostly attributable to corporation tax receipts and the revenue from the Court of Justice of the European Union judgment.",
                "Following the enactment of the Future Ireland Fund and Infrastructure, Climate and Nature Fund Act earlier this year, on July 30, I signed the commencement order to officially establish both funds. They are a critical part of ensuring that future generations are not left to deal with the known challenges facing us. They allow us, at a time when we are recording headline surpluses, to plan for the future while still being in a position to react and provide for those who most need our assistance, to continue to invest in improving public infrastructure and good public services and to continue to support our businesses. In September, €4.3 billion was transferred into the Future Ireland Fund and €2 billion into the Infrastructure, Climate and Nature Fund. A further €4.1 billion will be transferred to the Future Ireland Fund this year. Transfers to both funds next year totalling €6 billion will mean by the end of next year, more than €16 billion will have been transferred to the funds.",
                "I can inform the House that we are projecting a general Government surplus of €23.7 billion, or 7.5% of national income, this year and €9.7 billion, or 2.9%, next year. When windfall taxes and the one-off revenue from the Court of Justice of the European Union judgment are excluded, an underlying general government deficit of €6.3 billion is projected for 2024 and an underlying general government deficit of €5.7 billion is projected for 2025.",
                "Our debt ratio is moving in the right direction. When this Government took office in 2020 our general government debt stood at close to 110% of national income. My Department projects that this ratio will be 69% of national income this year and will decline to 56% of national income by the end of the decade.",
                "BUDGETARY STRATEGY",
                "The Government decided in the summer economic statement to provide a budgetary package of €8.3 billion for budget 2025, which is consistent with expenditure growth of 6.9% and will accommodate higher capital spending and provide for additional public services against the backdrop of a higher population. Budget 2025 consists of a net tax package of €1.4 billion and an expenditure package of €6.9 billion.",
                "I am also announcing today a cost-of-living package of €2.2 billion, which brings the total package for budget 2025 to €10.5 billion.",
                "BUDGET 2024 MEASURES",
                "INCOME TAX",
                "As I have previously stated, the focus of the personal income tax package in this budget is to support low- and middle-income earners by building on the progress already made during this Government’s term, specifically with regard to increases to tax credits and USC reductions. Therefore, today I am announcing a personal income tax package of €1.6 billion. I am increasing the main tax credits, that is, the personal, employee and earned income credits, by €125. I am increasing the standard rate cut-off point by €2,000 to €44,000, with proportionate increases for married couples and civil partners. Turning to the USC, I am reducing the 4% rate to 3%. This represents the second consecutive reduction to this rate.",
                "Following Government approval this morning, as of 1 January 2025, the national minimum wage will increase by 80 cent per hour to €13.50 per hour. Accordingly, to continue to ensure that these valued workers remain outside the higher rates of USC, I will be further increasing the entry threshold to the new 3% rate by €1,622 to €27,382, in line with the increase to the national minimum wage. This means that a full-time worker on the minimum wage will see an increase in his or her net take-home pay of approximately €1,424 on an annual basis. As a result of the cumulative increases to the main tax credits, a single person earning €20,000 or less in 2025 will now be outside of the income tax net.",
                "Carers play a fundamental role in our society, and the Government is committed to supporting individuals and families with caring responsibilities. It is also a priority to further contribute to the whole-of-government approach to tackling child poverty. Therefore, I am increasing the home carer tax credit by €150; the single person child carer credit by €150; the incapacitated child tax credit by €300; and the dependent relative tax credit by €60. Separately, the blind tax credit will be increased by €300, which is the first increase to this credit in many years.",
                "The income tax and USC enhancements I have announced today will provide a real benefit to taxpayers across all income levels. Of course, the various cost-of-living measures that will be announced shortly by the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, will provide further benefits. One of key objectives for this Government was to ensure that workers did not find themselves in a position where they pay more income tax solely because of wage growth as their incomes rise. Taking account of the cumulative personal income tax changes over the lifetime of this Government, the main tax credits have now been increased by 21% or €350 each from €1,650 to €2,000.",
                "The standard rate cut-off point for a single person has been increased by 25% or €8,700 from €35,300 to €44,000, with commensurate increases for persons who are married or in a civil partnership. The USC middle rate has now been reduced by 1.5 percentage points from 4.5% to 3%. The 2% USC ceiling band has now been increased by 34% or €6,898 from €20,484 to €27,382.",
                "CAPITAL ACQUISITIONS TAX (CAT)",
                "The capital acquisition thresholds, which apply to gifts and inheritances, were last increased in 2019 and I now intend to provide further increases to all thresholds. I believe this is appropriate given the increases in property values in the intervening period. I am increasing the group A threshold from €335,000 to €400,000, the group B threshold from €32,500 to €40,000 and the group C threshold from €16,250 to €20,000.",
                "SMALL BENEFIT EXEMPTION",
                "The small benefit exemption allows an employer to provide limited non-cash benefits or rewards to their workers without the payment of income tax, PRSI and USC.",
                "I am increasing the annual limit provided for in the exemption from €1,000 to €1,500 and will also permit five non-cash benefits to be granted by an employer in a single year under this exemption. This change will allow for greater flexibility to employers in giving non-tax rewards to their employees. This means that workers may receive up to three additional tax-free rewards or gifts, for instance, to reward exceptional performance or mark significant life events.",
                "CERVICALCHECK PAYMENTS",
                "I am introducing an exemption from income tax, capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax on payments made to the women impacted by the failures in the CervicalCheck national screening programme. Future and historic income or gains arising to these women from the investment of CervicalCheck payments will also be exempt from the relevant taxes. These exemptions are a further element of the State’s response to the failures of the CervicalCheck screening programme.",
                "EXTENSION OF SEAGOING NAVAL PERSONNEL TAX CREDIT",
                "The Naval Service plays a critical role in safeguarding our nation’s security. To complement the wider suite of recruitment and retention initiatives under way and to acknowledge the exceptional hardships borne by our naval personnel at sea, I am extending the seagoing naval personnel tax credit for five years, to the end of 2029.",
                "BENEFIT IN KIND - MOTOR VEHICLES",
                "With regard to the benefit-in-kind, BIK, regime for company cars, I am extending for a further year the temporary universal relief of €10,000 to the original market value, which was first introduced in 2023. An employee with an electric company vehicle will have an overall BIK relief of €45,000 in 2025, which comprises of the €35,000 electric vehicle specific relief, which is already in legislation, plus the additional temporary universal relief of €10,000. I am also providing for a BIK exemption for the provision of electric vehicle chargers at the home of a director or employee.",
                "RENT TAX CREDIT",

This measure, which will come into effect from 1 January next, will provide an alternative, much simplified mechanism for double tax relief for multinational businesses. Work will continue in the coming year on participation exemptions, including further consideration of geographic scope and of a foreign branch exemption.",
                "It is critical that we continue to actively work on maintaining Ireland’s attractiveness to businesses. The review of the tax treatment of interest, in respect of which a public consultation was launched last Friday, will seek to further reduce complexity in our tax code.",

Two changes will come into effect from 1 January 2025. I will retain the extension of the upper age limit for the relief from 65 years until the age of 70 to reflect current work practices. I am also providing that where there are disposals by the child or children above €10 million within 12 years of receiving the assets, a clawback of the relief will apply. Therefore, where the child or children retain the assets for more than 12 years, the CGT will be fully abated. This will support the growth and scaling of the family-owned businesses that are so important to our communities across our country.",

This Government has shown significant ambition in recent budgets in supporting the sector to capitalise on its recent successes.",

This credit will be available at a rate of 20% on qualifying expenditure of up to €15 million and, similar to the other audiovisual reliefs, projects will be required to pass a cultural test.",
                "In addition, in response to specific challenges being faced by smaller feature film projects in bringing their stories to the screen, I am introducing a new 8% uplift under the section 481 film tax credit, again subject to state aid approval. This will apply to feature film productions with a maximum qualifying expenditure of €20 million. Further details of these two new supports will be set out in the Finance Bill next week.",
                "I am also conscious of the importance of the visual effects sector within our wider audiovisual offering in Ireland.

I can confirm the extension of the following reliefs to the end of 2027: general stock relief, stock relief for young trained farmers and stock relief for registered farm partnerships. I am also broadening the scope of accelerated capital allowances for farm safety equipment by adding further qualifying farm safety equipment types that can benefit from the relief.",

                "I am aware that there can be income instability in the farming sector in general and the dairy sector more specifically. I am keen to advance an income volatility measure to support the farming sector for consideration in advance of next year’s budget. This requires detailed consideration of complex issues of policy around how this would operate in the context of financial regulation, governance and legal structures. My officials will work with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in progressing proposals for consideration.",
                "AGRICULTURAL STAMP DUTY RELIEFS",
                "How farmers organise their farm business has been changing in recent years, and to reflect modern developments in the agriculture sector, I am amending both the young trained farmer stamp duty relief and the stamp duty relief which applies to farmers who lease land. The relief for young trained farmers will be revised so that it will be available where it is claimed by an individual farmer who carries on the farm business through a company. The leasing relief will be amended to also encompass farmers who have chosen to incorporate their business.",
                "AGRICULTURAL RELIEF",
                "Agricultural relief promotes the transfer of farms from one generation to the next and is an important measure to allow our young people to pursue their lives on the family farm.",
                "In recent years, agricultural land has increased in value above inflation and it is difficult for genuine farmers to purchase the land they need for farming. To address this and concerns that agricultural relief is being used as part of tax planning strategies by wealthy individuals, I am extending the six-year active test to the person who provides the gift or inheritance. This measure supports current farmers and the next generation.",
                "FARMERS FLAT RATE COMPENSATION",
                "The House will be aware that the flat-rate scheme compensates unregistered farmers on an overall basis for VAT incurred on their farming inputs. Based on macroeconomic data received from the CSO and the Revenue Commissioners for the period 2022 to 2024, it is proposed that this rate be increased from the current 4.8% to 5.1% from 1 January 2025.",
                "RESIDENTIAL ZONED LAND TAX (RZLT)",
                "The residential zoned land tax is an important lever to activate the building of houses on appropriate sites which have been identified by local authorities across the country. It is important that the measure does not unduly impact landowners who carry out genuine economic activity on their land. Therefore, I am providing an opportunity for these landowners to avail of an exemption in 2025 if they seek to have their land rezoned to reflect the activity they carry out on their land. The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage will issue guidelines to local authorities indicating that they should consider and accommodate rezoning requests where landowners seek to continue undertaking existing economic activity.",

                "Changes will be made to the tax exemptions that apply to those bodies to facilitate long-term investments for the purposes of future capital projects and sport equipment needs to support Ireland’s high-performance athletes and wider sports participation.",
                "Furthermore, I will be bringing measures forward in the Finance Bill to allow those making donations to sports bodies for capital projects and the other objectives greater flexibility in how those donations will be treated for income tax purposes. It is my intention that both PAYE and self-assessed donors will be able to choose for the income tax relief on donations under the relevant tax provisions to go either to themselves or to the sporting body itself. I believe that this will provide an additional incentive for taxpayers across the country to provide direct support to their local and national clubs and bodies.",
                "I strongly believe that physical activity is an essential part of supporting the health and mental well-being of all our citizens, young and old. As such, I believe there is merit in examining how the tax system can help to achieve greater participation in sport and fitness activities, including through gyms, for example. Over the course of next year, my officials will continue this work with the view of developing proposals for consideration in advance of next year's budget.",
                "CHARITIES/PHILANTHROPY",
                "The five-year national philanthropy policy, launched last December, is key to fostering a new approach to giving. As an initial step in supporting the policy, I will remove barriers to charities having access to tax benefits under the charitable donations scheme. Charities will no longer have to have been established for at least two years to access the scheme, and will have a longer timeframe from the date of a donation to use the funds raised under the scheme for the important work they do.",

This will bring the price of cigarettes in the most popular price category to €18.05 and supports public health policy to reduce smoking levels in Irish society. A financial resolution will be introduced tonight to enact this measure.",

                "I am introducing a domestic tax on e-cigarettes on public health grounds as there has been a significant rise in their use. The tax will apply to all e-liquids at a rate of 50 cent per ml of e-liquid. A typical disposable vape contains 2 ml of e-liquid, and costs in the region of €8. This new tax will bring the price of such a product to €9.23, including VAT. Due to the operational and administrative challenges associated with this measure, it will not commence until the middle of next year and therefore will be subject to a commencement order.",

                "INTRODUCTION",
                "Today’s budget sets out a positive path for the future while striving to meet the needs of today. It is a budget for an Ireland with a growing population, full employment, public finances in surplus and public services expanding to meet our country’s needs. This positive position is the result of a balanced and planned approach to stewarding our economy and the hard work of the Irish people. Before we look to the future, I want to take a moment to reflect on the past four years. A series of shocks from beyond our shores guided many of the measures taken in those budgets that I have had the privilege of delivering since the election of this Dáil.",
                "Since 2020, we have faced unprecedented challenges and risks of economic instability. These challenges of a pandemic, war in Europe and spiralling inflation were external in origin, but caused real impacts here at home, which we have dealt with due to the careful management of our country's finances. Before I announce the measures in budget 2025, allow me to take a moment to highlight some of the lasting improvements that have been delivered despite those many challenges. Our investment has resulted in: 768,000 children benefiting from free school books, 500,000 children eligible for free school meals and 180,000 children benefiting from the national childcare scheme; a significant increase in expenditure in the health service resulting in outpatient waiting lists reduced by 50,000 since 2021 and our life expectancy reaching 82 years, the sixth highest in the EU; 116,000 new homes delivered since 2020; and a record number of people in employment – nearly 500,000 more than just before the pandemic – and a new public service pay agreement for our gardaí, nurses and teachers. The Minister for Finance and I absolutely appreciate the many challenges confronting so many of our citizens. We recognise the many difficulties that clearly exist, but here today we make the case that budget 2025 will make a positive difference to those difficulties, just as previous budgets have.",
                "EXPENDITURE STRATEGY",
                "Our strategy during this Dáil was to grow and improve public services by increasing our spending by 5% each year. Given the nature of the challenges that we confronted, including inflation and the pandemic, the 5% anchor was simply not appropriate to cover the growth and expansion of services our country needed and needs. Instead, our Government provided a robust response to the challenges we confronted to ensure the most vulnerable in society were protected, supports were available for individuals, families and businesses from the pandemic unemployment payment to cost-of-living supports, our economic growth was sustained and strengthened, and our growing population was provided for with investment in a higher level of public service provision. Our strategy was the right one. We made essential adjustments to it, depending on the particular set of challenges we were facing. Not to do so would have meant not being able to protect and to provide for our people during times of the greatest need.",
                "I am sometimes also asked why we do not spend more of our budget surpluses. During the pandemic, to keep people safe, we had to ask people not to go to work. Hundreds of thousands of people became unemployed with the Government spending billions of euro to support them and businesses during this difficult time.",
                "Just as our country and we were getting back on our feet, the cost-of-living crisis hit, and we were in a position to help once more as prices went up. That is the reason to run budget surpluses. It allows for flexibility and gives us a far better chance of being able to deal with the risks that we do not see coming.",
                "Every budget process is a balancing act. We are tasked with making difficult decisions and we know that our choices have a real impact. I am confident that the decisions and how we spend our money, such as investing surpluses in the Future Ireland Fund and the Infrastructure Climate and Nature Fund, will greatly benefit our nation in the decades ahead.",
                "BUDGET 2025",
                "Indeed, our public finances continue to show strength. They show resilience, and budget 2025 will build on the progress made in the Government’s previous four budgets. As set out in the summer economic statement, this budget sees expenditure of €105.4 billion. This is an increase of 6.9% on last year.",
                "LIVING STANDARDS",
                "A Cheann Comhairle, turning now to the specific spending measures, we are all so aware that we are still feeling the impact of the external factors I mentioned earlier. Although inflation has thankfully come down, prices have been slow to follow, and cost-of-living increases of more than 19% between January 2021 and August of this year have left many in our country worrying about their finances.",
                "While we have successfully insulated the lowest earning households from the worst effects of the price increases, the Government is still conscious that prices remain high and we remain committed to protecting the most vulnerable in our society through a series of supports.",
                "COST OF LIVING",
                "Budget 2025 will include an energy credit of €250 for all households. It will be paid in two equal payments, one before the end of the year and one after. A further €300 lump sum payment will be made to recipients of the fuel allowance in November.",
                "An additional €200 will be paid to recipients of the living alone allowance. There will be a €400 payment to those who receive the carer’s support grant, disability allowance, blind pension, invalidity pension and domiciliary care allowance in November of this year.",
                "To support parents and students, funding will continue for the school transport fee reduction and the State exam fee waiver.",
                "I am also providing for: the continued reduction of the student contribution fees by €1,000, a once-off reduction of 33% in the contribution fee for apprenticeships in higher education and an increase in the postgraduate tuition fee contribution by €1,000 for student grant recipients. I am also providing additional funding to support students at a time of increased strain from cost of living through the student assistance fund.",
                "SOCIAL PROTECTION",
                "In addition to those measures, which are temporary, to help at a moment of great challenge for many, I am pleased to announce a social protection package for 2025 worth €1.2 billion that is targeted to those with the greatest needs.",
                "This includes: an increase of €12 per week for an individual in receipt of a weekly social protection payment and further support to those with a disability and carers. I am increasing the carer's allowance means test disregard to €625 for a single person and €1,250 for a couple, increasing the rate of the domiciliary care allowance by €20, increasing the carer’s support grant by €150 to €2,000 and enabling the carer’s allowance to be made a qualifying payment for the fuel allowance.",
                "To further support families and children, the following will take place: I am increasing maternity, paternity, adoptive and parents’ payments by €15. We are increasing the weekly rate of the increase for the qualified child payment by €4 for under 12s and by €8 for over 12s. We are extending the hot school meals programme to all remaining primary schools in 2025 and introducing a school meals holiday hunger pilot project next summer. We will then introduce a newborn grant of an additional double child benefit payment, in addition to the first month of child benefit.",
                "This will be a €420 payment to families for each newborn child.",
                "I am also pleased to announce a further €1 billion for a range of cost-of-living supports, including an October bonus double payment for recipients of long-term social protection payments. Nearly 1.4 million people will benefit. These are our pensioners, those with disabilities, our carers, lone parents and those who are long-term unemployed.",
                "CHILDREN AND FAMILIES",
                "The ambition of this Government is for our country to be one of the best countries in the world in which to be a child. We have made eradicating child poverty an absolute priority in the last five years and have delivered a complete overhaul of supports available to parents. Under this Government, investment in early learning and childcare has increased by 95%, from €567 million in 2019 to €1.4 billion in 2024. Free GP care has also been made available to all children under eight."

Today, I am allocating €8.3 billion to the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, with investment in early learning and childcare increasing to nearly €1.4 billion. Funding for the national childcare scheme will increase by 44%. What does this mean? This investment means that next year parents will see full-time childcare costs reduce even further by an additional €1,100. In addition, the number of children availing of this scheme is set to increase to 216,000 in 2025.",
                "A €336 million increase is being provided for disability services to provide additional residential care beds, more respite, more home support hours and a day service place for school leavers.

Developing a dynamic, inclusive and affordable education system allows us to build the Ireland of tomorrow. That is why, in education, a capital allocation of €1.3 billion will support 350 building projects that are currently under way, as well as a further 200 new school projects. Budget 2025 will provide the funding for 768 additional special education teachers and a further 1,600 special needs assistants.",
                "Building on the success of the Keeping Childhood Smartphone Free initiative, 2025 will see the roll-out of supports to allow our post-primary schools to do just that during the school day. This policy is about how we support the well-being of our children and give them the best possible learning environment. The budget will also see a substantial increase in funding for the school transport scheme in recognition of its importance in providing access for children living remote from their nearest school.",
                "Reducing the cost of education is a priority for this Government. I am providing funding to extend the free schoolbooks initiative to all transition and senior cycle pupils in recognised post-primary schools within the free education scheme. Just as education is one component in ensuring a thriving country, so is feeling supported in times of ill health.",
                "HEALTH",
                "In July, I reached an important agreement with the Department of Health and the HSE to provide additional funding of €2.7 billion for the health sector over two years. It provides a stable funding plan, bringing the total health allocation to €25.76 billion. We agreed that this additional funding would support better financial planning and governance, establishing a clearer link between this level of funding and the improved health outcomes that are happening.",
                "Our health service workers are central to this work. In 2025, the numbers working in our health service, not including disability services, will reach over 130,000 whole-time equivalents, an increase of 27% since 2019. The budget will also include funding for a range of new measures that will increase access, affordability and capacity in our health service, including the introduction of 495 new beds to our health service across hospital and community services, bringing the total number of beds to over 18,000; 600,000 additional home support hours; and continued support for women’s health measures, including increased access to IVF and hormone replacement therapy free of charge.",
                "This budget will also include funding to facilitate the continued development and improvement of mental health services, as set out in the national mental health strategy, Sharing the Vision. Implementing this strategy is an important commitment in the programme for Government and it is a huge priority for the Government, the Department of Health and the HSE. That is why the funding provided in this budget will enable enhanced provision of services, including with regard to youth mental health services; counselling for the Traveller community; suicide bereavement counselling; the CyberSafeKids initiative; and additional children and adolescent mental health services. This budget ensures the health service is well funded and is able to deliver better access and better health outcomes into the future.",

This fund has two very important roles: first, to ensure we have money to invest during periods when the economy is not doing so well; and, second, to invest in climate transition to prepare for and make happen a greener future. More than €3 billion is being set aside for this second role between 2026 and 2030. We will shortly set out how this money will be invested to provide a clear and consistent signal to those who wish to invest in these ambitions. The allocation process will be subject to further work between myself and the other Ministers. It will be used to support important projects that can assist with the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, improve our water quality and improve on and deliver our nature and biodiversity objectives. What this will mean in practice is supporting projects that help Ireland to meet our climate and environmental obligations and ambitions, including climate neutrality. This will improve the lives of the people of Ireland. Further details on this proposed approach are set out in documentation published by my Department today.",

As we continue to invest in this, we will see further benefits, including warmer homes, less congestion in towns and cities, enhanced biodiversity and cleaner air and water. In support of these goals, capital funding for the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications has been increased to over €1.14 billion, allowing for record allocations to be made for investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy. Warmer homes funding will reach a record level and is likely to reach more than ten times the funding provided in 2020, which will increase the number of homes benefiting from deeper retrofits. Funding will also support up to half of the cost of energy efficiency upgrades being met by the State, complemented by loans supported by the State. To support our farmers in becoming more environmentally sustainable, over €716 million is being provided next year for those participating in agri-environmental schemes, such as ACRES.",

What this will mean is that it will bring the total carbon tax revenue that is available for investment to €951 million. Half of this amount will go to paying for the improved energy efficiency of our homes, which is an additional €89 million next year compared to this year. In addition, the carbon tax will fund €306 million of social protection spending next year. An additional €44 million for targeted measures, namely, changes to the qualified child payment and an increase to the income eligibility threshold for the working family payment, will ensure that the most vulnerable are protected from unintended impacts of the tax increase.",

This is why I am allocating over €2 billion for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for next year. This shows the broad support of the Government to all the sectors, ensuring that we support our farmers, fishers and foresters. This is because the agrifood sector is a core part of our rural communities and our largest indigenous industry. Budget 2025 will support an innovative and sustainable sector that enriches our biodiversity, protects our landscapes and contributes to our economy. It will provide additional funding for a range of supports across sectors, including: €30 million for a new tillage scheme to support farmers to plant their field crops; €10 million for animal health measures improving biosecurity; €22 million for the continuation of the national sheep welfare scheme into next year; and €8 million to enhance payment rates on the national beef welfare scheme.",

I am providing €472 million for the Department of Rural and Community Development. This will help deliver important commitments set out in Our Rural Future and the national development plan and will promote social inclusion in both urban and rural areas. The Department will have total capital funding of €235 million in 2025 to support the revitalisation of rural Ireland through schemes including the rural regeneration and development fund, the LEADER programme, the town and village renewal scheme, the outdoor recreation infrastructure scheme and the CLÁR programme.",

The enterprise sector lays the foundations for economic growth, our well-being in the future and our prosperity. We must also recognise the difficulties businesses have been facing. To support them we are investing over €1 billion in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment’s jobs and enterprise development, innovation and commercialisation and regulation programmes in 2025; capital funding to enable IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland to provide additional environmental aid to their clients; and almost €7 million in additional funding to the Department’s regulatory bodies and agencies.",
                "Recognising that rising energy costs continue to have an impact for hospitality and retail businesses, I am today announcing an energy subsidy scheme for these businesses, worth €170 million. This will provide support to approximately 39,000 firms.",

As the House knows, the fund is in surplus due to the growth in the numbers at work and also the increased contribution employers are making through their PRSI receipts.",
                "Today, I am announcing an almost €1.5 billion package over a six-year period to 2030, comprising both current and capital investment to better fund research, further and higher education, skills, development and decarbonisation. This multi-annual commitment will include an increase in core funding to higher education by €150 million per annum. The main focus of this will be on meeting the funding requirements of our universities, as set out in the Funding the Future framework. This in turn will deliver additional healthcare and veterinary places under the expressions of interest expansion programme and an increase in certain PhD stipends.",
                "The funding for further education will support: €78 million for the continued growth of our craft apprenticeship system, a system that is vital to the future growth of our economy, and will provide 6,800 apprentice registrations in 2025; skills requirements in micro, small and medium-sized enterprises to build business for the future, as well as upskilling for the community, voluntary and social enterprise sector; and the development of construction and the talent we need for a greener future in providing the people and skills to address Government priorities, such as Housing for All and the climate action plan.",

                "A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, we live in a volatile world. It is a world in which the pace of change is accelerating and the level of complexity is building, but the scale of opportunity is growing. This is why we must run budget surpluses. This is why we must set aside some of our country’s money for the future. This is why we must invest our recent gains in the Ireland of tomorrow and not spend everything today, no matter how tempting.",
                "In my years serving as a Minister for Finance for our country I have led our finances from deficit to surplus twice. These healthy public finances have allowed our country to build more homes; to keep and create jobs; to invest in our future and a greener future; and to improve our public services, all while dealing with the crises of a pandemic, a war in Europe and then soaring inflation.",
                "The politics and economics of the centre, of a steady approach to the many and competing demands, of embracing the opportunities and responsibilities of our role in the world, of supporting growth and jobs under this Government, is an approach that is working. Let me be clear. Making the case for progress is not the same as denying the reality of the many pressing problems that I know exist. This Government appreciates the urgency of the challenges of today. We are working to meet them head on. But, with optimism and with hope, I say to the Dáil, look at what our country has achieved in recent years, look at what we have overcome. Look at what we can yet do. Look at what lies ahead.",
                "Our recent budgets, and the choices that the Minister, Deputy Chambers, and I are presenting today, have and will play an essential role in this, in lessening our problems, in pursuing the great opportunities that await, and in building a better Ireland with a brighter future for all. That is why I commend budget 2025 to Dáil Éireann."

                "This is the last budget from this Government and like all others there will be a spending increase. But the question we must ask ourselves, as with all other budgets, is if it will make the big difference that people need in their lives and the difference they are crying out for. Will it address the housing crisis, and make housing affordable, as laid out by Sinn Féin? The answer is no, it will not. Will it fix the health service that is on its knees? No, it will not. Will it address the cost-of-living crisis in a meaningful way? For example, will it abolish USC on the first €45,000 of income for all workers? No, it will not. Will it deliver the fundamental change that we need in our childcare system by introducing childcare for €10 per day for families across the State? Again, the answer is \"No\". The answer is \"No\" because this Government is incapable of delivering real change. It is incapable of getting value for money. People see through the spin. People hear about the millions and billions of euro but they do not feel better off. For most people it is about what they have at the end of the week and if, when the bills are paid, there is anything left. That is the question they ask. The answer for far too many is \"No\". Workers and families cannot afford another five years of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. It is in this context that the budget will be judged and how the Government parties will be judged at election time. This Government has been exposed over and again as serial wasters. They treat the public with contempt when they waste taxpayers' money on every project, big or small.",
                "These go from a bike shed, to the national children's hospital, to a security hut, to modular units for Ukrainians that are costing more than semi-detached houses built with bricks and mortar. That is the record of the Ministers sitting opposite me. That is what we get after Fine Gael has been in office for 14 years and no one takes responsibility, no one is held to account and the merry-go-round goes around and around. The Government wasted €10 million on lawyers, fighting a losing battle to deny the State €14 billion that it now wants to dish out.",
                "Despite the budget being announced today, we still feel poor as a country in so many ways, such as in housing in health, in disabilities and in mental health. The Government's job is not just to spend money; it also needs to get results. That is where the Government is completely and utterly failing. Under Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, people see a deepening housing crisis. Month after month, we pass new, shameful milestones in housing with record homelessness, rents and house prices and nobody takes responsibility. We have a Minister for housing and that is his record. Yet, he stands up here an applauds a Government that does not provide any new additional social and affordable homes. Everyone suffers when this Government fails to build the homes that are needed. Higher rents and higher house prices are the consequences. Sinn Féin is committed to bringing homeownership back within the reach of working people.",
                "This Government is great at spin. It has talked over and over again about homeownership. To be clear, since this Government came into office, house prices have risen by €100,000, on average, in Dublin. That is the record of the Government. The other record it has is that homeownership for young people has collapsed under Fine Gael. There are 100,000 fewer people under the age of 40 who own their home today than when Fine Gael came into government 14 years ago. That is the Government's record. It has halved the number of people who own their home in that age bracket. It is a failure so big that it is hard to believe. On the other end, Fine Gael has more than doubled the number of people who are in their 60s and are still renting because they do not own a home. At the same time, the number of people in their 20s who are renting has completely collapsed. Why? They are not renting because they are living in their parents' box rooms or they are on a plane on the way to Australia. That is the record of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael and that is why we cannot afford another five years of these two parties.",
                "Many of these individuals are nurses, doctors, teachers and other essential workers. This does not just have an impact on them or on their families but it also has an impact on the wider public services that we all rely on in the State. In the Ireland of 2024, in a State where we are recording a surplus of €24 billion, we have children with autism being denied their constitutional right to education. Let that sink in. In the Ireland of 2024, with a surplus of €24 billion, children cannot get assessment of needs and parents have gone for years without therapies for their children. These are simple, basic things, such as speech and language therapy or the assistance that a child needs to be able to eat, speak or walk. In the Ireland of today, we are a poor country when it comes to issues like this. These are basic needs that any First World country should be able to deliver. Over and over again, however, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael continue to fail these families that are crying out for assistance. They want assistance to help their child to speak or to eat. They have been left fighting for these basics for year after year.",
                "The most glaring reminder for all of us in this House and outside, is the Government's failure for the children with scoliosis and spina bifida. In the past 24 hours, another parent had to go public with her child's heartbreaking story. No parent should have to do that because the State should provide the services for those most in need. No parent should have to campaign, fight or battle the State for what his or her child deserves. However, under Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael in the Ireland of 2024 with €24 billion of a surplus, parents have to fight and expose their children to that and battle every single day. It is not acceptable. The longer they wait, the worse the condition gets. It is a race against the clock against the child's condition becoming inoperable. What did today's budget do for them? It gave them no more hope for these children than they had yesterday. That is what the budget will be judged on. This Government has all the financial resources, but completely fails to deliver on basic services. That has been the hallmark of the Government's term in office. It has squandered money and five years. The Government will be judged on that when the general election comes.",

                "This is not a giveaway budget. This is a giving-up-on-housing budget. The Government has raised the white flag when it comes to housing, affordable housing and renters. This budget gives nowhere near the funding required. This means that the same inadequate social and affordable housing targets are being delivered. The Government is not planning to build a single social and affordable house more that it has already committed to. It has completely ignored the Housing Commission's report, which was a damning indictment of Government policy. The report accuses the Government of failing to treat housing as a priority. In this it was absolutely right. It called for a radical reset of housing policy and this budget again shows that the Government is incapable of delivering the radical reset needed. To not increase the targets at all is shocking. Not only is it shocking, it is an insult to everybody who is struggling to get an affordable house or pay rent. After eight years at the Cabinet table, what we heard recently is that the Taoiseach started talking about building more homes. This budget exposes that this is nothing more than soundbites. Not a single increase in housing targets is allowed for in this budget. This is a Taoiseach who cares more about headlines than he does about housing and this budget proves it.",

This could be delivered next year for all parents in centre-based childcare and Tusla-based child measures and then rolled out to all other childminders. We now see that all the Government's talk about supporting parents is just talk. There is no further reduction in the cost of childcare planned for next year. That is a fact. There is a lot of spin coming from Mr. Soundbite but, when it comes to substance, we see that childcare costs will not be reduced."

I have been responding to budgets for 14 years and never once has there been a bigger tax break for an individual in those 14 years. This Government has given a massive tax break to people with gold-plated pensions, increasing the standard fund threshold to give tax breaks on pension pots of up to €2.8 million. This gives an individual a tax break of €320,000. Neither in my time nor, I am guessing, before has there been a tax change that benefits certain individuals so much. Who are the only people who can benefit? Who are the only people in that golden club who will benefit from that change? It is people who already have a pension pot in excess of €2 million. They are the only people who will benefit from the Government's €320,000 tax break. I expect that sums it all up.

It was very upset that Sinn Féin wanted to tax luxury private jets but its Members gave a standing ovation to the Minister who is going to increase the price of petrol and diesel for ordinary workers, people who want to drop their kids to school or go to work or who need to go to a hospital appointment. Perhaps they do not know this but the reality is that the richest 1% are responsible for more carbon emissions than all middle and low-income workers together. Despite this, they are not being asked to bear their fair share of the burden. The Government just jacks up the carbon tax over and over again. This is a regressive tax that hits low-income and rural houses the hardest. We already have one of the highest carbon taxes in Europe. There are tax cuts for some and carbon taxes for everyone else. Sinn Féin's plan for funding the green transition fairly is very clear.",

There are children whose condition is deteriorating and others who have to wait months for life-changing surgeries. As we know, money is not the issue. We have been running surpluses for years. Time is not the issue either because Fine Gael has been in government for 14 years. For God's sake, the Taoiseach was the Minister for Health for four of those years. The issue is not time or money but the Government. That is the issue. That is why we have the health service we have. There are no more excuses.

We have been waiting for this Government to get its act together but it has not happened and is not going to happen. It is becoming harder and harder for ordinary workers to see a GP. Dental treatment for people with medical cards has collapsed. Mental health services in this State are threadbare. Everybody knows that. People who are reaching out and looking for support on the other side are not getting it. This is having devastating consequences for our young people. Last year, in the face of all this, the Government knowingly underfunded health. That was one of the most callous decisions I have ever seen. It was an extraordinary example of reckless management and Sinn Féin and others called the Government out on it immediately. The HSE called it out. The Government's own Department of Health called it out. Indeed, IFAC called it out. It took nine long months for the Government to admit it had it got in wrong in last year's budget. That did real damage to morale, to the reputation of the health service and to care providers' ability to plan.",
                "That decision led to a year of chaotic financial management and a recruitment embargo. All the while, the HSE was forced to become more and more reliant on expensive agency staff. Today, therefore, was the opportunity for the Government to lay out a vision for health and to lay out a vision for hope, but there is no hope, no vision and no urgency in the budget for health this year. Again, there is more of the spin. The Government has claimed there is a €3 billion increase for health. Let us be serious, however. Last year, the Government underfunded health and now it is playing catch up. Of that €3 billion, €1.5 billion is to cover last year's legacy deficit that was created, while €1.2 billion is standstill money. This means no improvement in services, it is just to stand still. When we strip all that back, therefore, and consider the fact that €240 million has already been announced in the form of pre-committed capital in the national development plan, it leaves €120 million for new measures-----"

We also proposed the most substantial package of supports ever presented by any party for carers in a single budget. That means the means test, which we all know unfairly excludes thousands of carers from receiving the carers allowance, being abolished. That is why we are very clear that Sinn Féin in government will abolish the means test for carers. Starting this year, it should start with a significant expansion of the scheme. We called for increasing the threshold for carers from €900 to €1,460 for a couple. That is five times what the Government did last year and ten times what the Government announced this year."

Ministers queue up to clap themselves in the back for divvying out the spoils to the electorate to persuade them to turn a blind eye to how they have been failed, how their families have been failed and how their communities have been failed. I wonder whether they will thank Commissioner Vestager for the part she has played in this in fighting to give us the €14 billion due to us. People know we have been here before, with the empty promises, the repeated announcements of the same projects, the claims that lessons have been learned, accompanied by feigned expressions of \"everyone was responsible\", yet nobody is accountable.",

Blank cheques have been written with other people's money. The shocking waste of money has rightly angered people who struggle to make ends meet and who are denied services and supports they desperately need. They are angered by the €336,000 bicycle rack, the €1.4 million security hut and the escalating overruns of most expensive hospital in the world. Why did the current Taoiseach, who was Minister for Health at the time, sign off on a contract that needed 469 change orders and more than 23,000 drawings? Now we have modular homes costing €442,000 each, more than double the original projected cost of €200,000. This level of bungling and ineptitude demands more than commentary from the Government that failed to carry out its duties. The delays for children who grow into adulthood without having access to the levels of services and treatment promised by this Government from the children's hospital are devastating and the consequence of money being sucked up by the national children's hospital debacle is delays in the expansion and refurbishment of regional hospitals and other health facilities."

How much more of our money is wasted? How much more is this Government hiding from us? How many times is commercial sensitivity used to cover up costly mismanagement of projects and the granting of open-ended, undefined contracts? Lessons are never, ever learned by Fine Gael or by Fianna Fáil. Let us cast our minds back to 2005, a time when the country was awash with money just as it is now. The Celtic tiger roared loudly, Fianna Fáil and their friends partied on borrowed money they should never have been lent in the first place and citizens were later forced to pick up the tab of austerity. Is it any wonder that people are saying here today that we should talk about the here and now and forget about what has happened up to now? I remind the Government that the HSE's PPARS computer system, estimated to cost €9 million ended up costing in excess of €220 million, almost 25 times more than the initial costing. Here we are, 20 years later but have lessons been learned? No, they have not. Why? It is because no one responsible every pays; only the taxpayers pay. Transparency matters, accountability matters and competence matters. Tá tábhacht ag baint le saoránaigh.",

The fact is that we have had decades of solid evidence to prove that Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil will again be reckless and careless with our money. Over the past 13 years too many people have been left behind by Fine Gael-led Governments. Too many people have suffered the consequences of bad policies and the failure to keep promises, not least the children who have been made to wait too long for their spinal surgery, the children with scoliosis who were promised. The Taoiseach has left the House now but he promised. They were promised. When I saw them last week, after Deputy Mary Lou McDonald hosted them in the audiovisual room, being pushed out in chairs in the pouring rain, it brought it home to me how much this Government has failed. A 15-year-old boy came into my office who has been told it is too late and the Government will not even give him a second opinion abroad. I got a letter from the Taoiseach wishing him \"all the best\". My God, he promised but he certainly did not deliver.",

Today we sit here surrounded by billions of euro, 14 of which Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil fought to have spent elsewhere. In fact, they spent €10 million of taxpayers' money fighting so that one of the richest companies in the world could benefit from being facilitated to pay no tax on €104 billion in profits. Lest anyone try to misconstrue Sinn Féin’s support for foreign direct investment and acknowledgement of the 250,000 plus jobs in Ireland, our commitment to remain competitive by urgently tackling the infrastructure deficit, particularly in housing, renewable energy, water, telecommunications and decarbonisation, is absolute, alongside our commitment to investment in education and training. The new OECD minimum corporation tax rate means it is more important than ever to invest in the drivers of foreign direct investment. Our indigenous businesses deserve tax fairness and opportunities to thrive. Our overreliance on a very small number of companies to produce year-on-year surpluses leaves our small open economy in a precarious position and vulnerable to geopolitical shocks, yet the Government has no explicit strategy to grow the regions and address key infrastructure deficits, particularly along the western seaboard. The Atlantic economic corridor is paved with empty promises and rhetoric. Macroeconomic headlines mean little to people who do not have a home of their own or cannot pay the bills.",

The wealthiest 10% of Irish households own approximately €518 billion or 48% of total household net wealth in the country. This creates conditions where extremely disadvantaged groups end up pitted against each other for the allocation of resources and this will continue after this budget. More than 500,000 people live in poverty, almost 177,000 of whom are children, yet we are one of the wealthiest countries in the world. People rightly ask why. One of the Government’s biggest privileges and responsibilities is the task of devising policies to reflect the needs of the population it serves. The needs of those who give it the power to protect, to cultivate opportunity and to break the cycle of poverty are never met. Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have failed miserably. We know that living in poverty can have extensive and multifaceted effects on individuals, families and communities. We know too that enforced deprivation and financial and educational disadvantage can be transgenerational without the right interventions. How deep will the scars of child homelessness, the denial of access to psychology, mental health supports, speech and language therapies or other vital supports run? How many generations will be crushed by the failures of Fine Gael-led Governments over the past 13 years?",

Just imagine the situation if they had not been successful. We could have 14,500 people homeless and more than 4,000 of them could be children, an affordable home could cost €500,000, crippling rents could be a reality and the average age for owning your own home could be 39 if the Government's policies had not been so successful.",

                "A Sinn Féin Taoiseach would immediately begin structured and detailed planning towards Irish unity, underpinned by engagement with citizens across the country. We would establish citizens' assemblies on Irish unity to discuss all of the elements of reunification, to listen to all voices and to hear from experts. Sinn Féin backs the implementation of the Perspectives on Constitutional Change: Finance and Economics report, prepared by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. It recommends a Green Paper on constitutional change, the creation of a dedicated Oireachtas committee, a designated Department for constitutional planning, a whole-of-government approach across all Departments and State agencies, and deeper co-operation on the island on issues such as climate change, energy, education, transport and infrastructure. These are commonsense proposals backed by the entire Good Friday Agreement committee and they should be implemented without delay.",

Those people across the country who are British, unionists and Protestants are a valued part of our nation. I respect their culture and traditions. I want them to contribute to the wisdom, ideas and hopes for a new and united Ireland. Together we can create an inclusive home that we all can be proud of.",

The Minister mentioned all the national strategies for cancer, cardiac, stroke and maternity, but did not say how much. We have €30 million for new drugs, just reprofiling what was already there. Where is the money to expand the hospitals and community care, and for the mental health for older people? My litmus test is whether the trolleys will still line up outside Mayo University Hospital. My guess is they will. Will the beds that the Government closed in Belmullet hospital be reopened? How long more do we have to wait? It did not just happen; the Government made a decision to close them just as it did with many other hospitals around this country. People will not be fooled.",

Sinn Féin's multi-annual plan will deal with overcrowding, reduce waiting lists, improve patient safety and deliver healthcare free at the point of use. As Deputy Doherty said, that includes increasing hospital capacity for an additional 150,000 people. Ministers tell people that the moratorium has been lifted. The moratorium has not been lifted. Valuable staff are waiting on panels while hospitals are waiting for people to be appointed. The Minister should not pretend that the moratorium has been lifted because it has not. He should go and see what is happening on the ground.",

This State has the lowest employment rate of people with disabilities in Europe because the barriers to employment for people with disabilities have never been tackled. For too long lip service has been paid regarding the rights of people with disabilities. Sinn Féin in government will deliver those rights. The Government has presided over the scandalous delays for people waiting for assessments of needs for years. Additional funding announced earlier this year will not keep pace with demand and longer waiting lists will be the outcome. Parents and guardians are forced to seek private assessments which in many cases they cannot afford since the Government has effectively abandoned their children. Last week we saw and every week we see Cara Darmody, a teenager, leading the demonstration outside the gates of this Parliament on this very issue. That child should be at school and not protesting here and begging for these issues to be addressed. This should be a source of deep shame for this Government.",

Some people have multiple family members living with disabilities as a result of mothers following medical advice. Has the budget thought of them? They had to fight for years to get the inquiry that is now happening.",
                "Denial of treatment reduces life chances - it does not take a genius to work that out. We are a rich country and we can do things differently yet the choices are made by the most senior politicians in this State to deny assessments, delay access and diminish outcomes. The Sinn Féin alternative budget would fund targeted recruitment and retention measures for children's disability services and establish a community care access fund to speed up access to mental health, disability diagnosis and interventions. Poverty rates by households headed by people with disabilities are unconscionably high with 39% of this group experiencing poverty. We must ratify the optional protocol to the UNCRPD and fully implement and resource the necessary actions.",
                "Carers who provide unparalleled service to those in their care and to the State have also been forced by the Government to become campaigners. Mary Lou MacDonald has given a commitment to abolish the means test for carers. Many of the things we outlined in our alternative budget are to give advice to the Government and tell it what needs to be done. However, as we see here today, moving the eligibility threshold to €1,250 will not even be done until next July. That shows what it really thinks of carers. We would also introduce a pay-related carer benefit to enable carers who are in employment to access supports.",
                "Our alternative budget provides access to vital therapies, respite services, residential care, personal assistant services, home support hours and day services. These are the measures that citizens need to live with dignity. In our alternative budget Sinn Féin has clearly outlined how we will reduce the cost of childcare to €10 per day, how we will really value childcare workers, how we will ensure that childcare providers are sufficiently funded, and how social enterprises and community providers can be encouraged and expanded.",
                "Sinn Féin recognises the responsibility of all citizens to deliver on Ireland's objectives to meet our climate change targets. Climate change affects everybody and ultimately impacts several Departments. However, the party also recognises that this is a burden not currently equally shared by everyone. With this in mind we intend to ensure that those least able to carry more of the costs are supported in that journey to decarbonise by committing an additional €178 million to a new and reformed scheme delivering warmer, more efficient, less carbon-intense homes, improving health and well-being, and directly addressing the cost of living. I heard the Minister today laud the extra money to be given to the warmer home scheme. There is a 26-month waiting list for the warmer home scheme. I have known people who have died waiting to have their houses insulated even for basic insulation.",

Furthermore we recognise as we focus on delivering economic growth in a more circular bioeconomy with sustainability at its heart, we have the ability to generate a plethora of new jobs with the green economy, building community wealth across the country, ensuring that all can benefit from transition. We have also committed an additional €75.5 million to be invested in green spaces and nature restoration to address biodiversity demands, and expand afforestation and grow our national parks, all underpinned by the development of a pipeline of skills and expertise in new jobs to support economic, environmental and social sustainability at local and national level.",
                "As children must be able to get to school safely, we have made provision for an extra 100,000 seats for children on school buses. Adequately resourcing on climate can deliver tangible benefits in health, education and agriculture in the economy. Investment in climate solutions can present opportunities and benefits for all. Sinn Féin demonstrates that addressing climate change is not just a prerogative of those less fortunate in society; it is everyone's prerogative. This budget should deliver more fairness and equity for society and more benefits for the environment than the Government proposes. What is happening is that the money will go to the richest people. Other people will be left in homes and left shut out of schemes that are wrongly designed by the Government. Why are people not accessing the schemes? It is because everything this Government does is skewed in favour of those who do not need it and those who have money already. The Ministers know this from the retrofit scheme and what is happening in their own constituencies.",
                "Sinn Féin fully acknowledges the importance of the agrifood industry to the Irish economy. The industry provides employment for more than 173,000 people across 135,000 farms, 2,000 fishing vessels and more than 2,000 food and beverage producers and is the glue that holds the rural social fabric together. It binds communities together and delivers wealth to rural towns and villages across the 32 counties. Much of the revenue the industry delivers locally is spent locally between retail, the service sector, food processing, manufacturing and engineering. The list goes on. This is why we in Sinn Féin firmly believe it is imperative that direct supports be assured and strengthened to ensure that farms can remain viable, sustainable and profitable to deliver the high-quality foods and public goods now demanded.",
                "Sinn Féin’s alternative budget is not just about the food produced. It is also about the social contract that has been broken by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. It is also about the public goods that agriculture delivers as we commit to supporting areas of natural constraint and pledge to set up a commission on the future of family farms. Our party understands the value of family and the value of family farms. It is not just about onshore food production. We recognise as an island nation just how important aquaculture and our fishing fleet are. This commitment to the industry is copperfastened by €8.1 million for the introduction of a continuity fund for the inshore fishing fleet and a further €9 million identified for a number of industry support schemes.",

No doubt we will have a flurry of promises again about Knock airport, the western rail corridor and everything else just before the election. Prior to all the elections before this, we had the same flurry of announcements.",
                "I wish we were in a scenario where people in rural Ireland could rely on public transport, but across rural Ireland we can hardly get a bus shelter, never mind more regular routes and services. The irony of the Government's provision of the €336,000 Leinster House bike shelter is not lost on people in my constituency in Mayo and others left standing in the rain waiting on buses that often never come while we beg for bus shelters. Sinn Féin's alternative budget would invest heavily in public transport. We would progress the Navan rail line and the western rail corridor and we would accelerate the Connecting Ireland rural bus scheme. We would also invest €25 million to make public transport, including buses, more accessible for citizens with disabilities.",
                "Our roads need urgent attention. This is a matter of public safety, not just transport. We would also scrap the Government’s fuel hikes on petrol and diesel introduced last August and we would not proceed with the increases due this month. Research by the Northern and Western Regional Assembly shows that counties Mayo, Galway, Roscommon, Sligo, Donegal, Leitrim, Cavan and Monaghan received less than 10% of the State-wide total investment in infrastructure projects worth more than €1 million, and just 5.7% of investment from infrastructure projects worth more than €20 million. These facts speak for themselves. The Government can dress them up all it wants. This is despite the region accounting for 17.6% of Ireland’s population. Out of the 234 regions across the EU, the north west ranks 217th for infrastructure. That speaks volumes to rural Ireland. The Government cannot hide from those figures.",
                "The housing crisis does not discriminate and people who live their lives as Gaeilge and who want to raise their families as Gaeilge cannot do so because they cannot find or build a house in the Gaeltacht regions. If our budget was being implemented today, there would be capital investment of €15 million to support Údarás na Gaeltachta and implement an Irish language capital programme. We would also increase baseline funding for Údarás na Gaeltachta and introduce a rescue package for coláistí samhraidh agus mná tí.",
                "Last week, at an event in the University of Notre Dame, Iar-Taoiseach Leo Varadkar spoke of de-emphasising the Irish language in relation to unionists and the potential for Irish unity. Let me say clearly in this House, under a Sinn Féin government both Irish unity and the development and expansion of the Irish language would be progressed. The Irish language is flourishing in the North, including in areas with large unionist and Protestant populations.",
                "Our communities deserve a police service which keeps them safe, responds to crime promptly and is adequately resourced and supported. Gardaí are simply stretched too thinly to cope. They put themselves at risk on a daily basis because there are not enough of them. Under Fine Gael's watch, we have seen the worst rioting in memory on the streets of our capital. Shops and businesses were plundered and looted while their frantic owners repeatedly phoned for help to no avail. The fault lies with the Government, the so-called party of law and order which has presided over chaos and crime. Sinn Féin would fund the largest Garda recruitment drive in the history of the State. We would invest in youth and community services and €1 billion of the Apple tax would be invested in communities that have been trod on and left behind.",
                "The Government’s job is not just to spend money, it is to get results. The hollowness of the Government seeking credit for giving people back their own money once they have wasted loads of it by its incompetence is not lost on people. People will continue to struggle under this Government and the policies that have failed them for over a decade now. The Government will continue to try to buy votes with voters own money. Do we really want a situation where we have another five years of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, whereby every child in the State under the age of 18 would know nothing other than a Fine Gael Government in charge? That is the decision before the Irish people - 18 years of Fine Gael Government with no child knowing any different and thinking this was normal. This is not normal and we must never ever make it normal."

We have the highest number of people ever at work, yet one in five of these workers subsists on wages below a living wage. We have surpluses the envy of Europe, with public services and creaking infrastructure that should shame us. We have an apparent economic miracle papering over the cracks of the daily, sadly now routine, indignities of crushing child poverty.",

A century on, the policies of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have succeeded in dividing the people of this State socially and economically, winners versus losers. It need not have been this way, but these were the choices made by Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil. Politics is about choices. A few short years ago, our country was bust and our options were limited. Now, for the first time in our history, after a decade of uninterrupted growth, money is not the problem. It is a lack of imagination and vision that is holding our country and its people back. The Labour Party is different. We are ambitious for Ireland. Our country is at a crossroads and it needs a change of direction. An election should be called now. Never before was the Labour Party, the progressive centre left, more needed in government to shape a better and fairer future for this country to help get the basics of a rich country right.",

There is gravy everywhere, a deep dinner place drowned in tasty once-off measures to hide the fact and reality that there is very little real meat on offer to sustain anyone. It is an insult to the intelligence of the Irish people. The tragedy of this Government is that it has contrived to waste a boom. Strangled by its own crippling conservatism, the Government's ideology has made this rich country feel so poor, all presided over by Schrödinger's Taoiseach, Deputy Harris, the man who manages to be both in government and in opposition at the same time.",

Now, no thought from the Taoiseach, no matter how trivial or frivolous, goes unsent to grateful hacks dutifully and diligently reporting on them. The conduct of this budget is a case in point. Frankly, I was fully expecting to see copies of the Ministers' budget speeches in my pigeonhole in Leinster House this morning when I picked up my post. They were not there. They were everywhere else. The utter disrespect shown to the Members of this House and, indeed, Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and Green Party backbenchers, with the farcical feeding frenzy of leaks going back to spring, is breathtaking. The Ceann Comhairle believes in the primacy of this Parliament. I believe he should make public statements on this. It is damaging. The Government is playing every day with people's lives so people can get their names in the newspapers. It is self-serving and arrogant. It does politics a disservice. It undermines good government and militates against the kind of big thinking that this country needs and that this Government, on all of the evidence over many years, is simply incapable of doing. It is a political culture, with some exceptions, dominated by ego. It is all about getting your name in the paper rather than getting things done. It is about time we grew up. Other mature European countries - sophisticated democracies - do their budgets professionally and respectfully. They actively involve parliament, not actively bypass and ignore it. Things need to change.",

They are always on hand to take credit but never around to accept responsibility. We live in very peculiar political times but real accountability is on the way. We need an election now. That is where accountability happens, as it should.",

It was an insight into the narrow ideological mindsets of parties that were once rivals but are now indistinguishable from one another. You could paper the walls of Leinster House ten times over with pearl-clutching opinion pieces from Fine Gael TDs and Ministers on the injustices of inheritance tax thresholds. I was on the verge of calling Amnesty International to see if it could help the Minister of State, Deputy Richmond, with a postcard campaign. I was very worried about him. Where is the anger? Where is the same anger over the injustice of nearly 15,000 of our citizens in this rich country living in emergency accommodation?"

The Minister, Deputy Burke, spent most of the spring and summer leaning on the independent Low Pay Commission to cool the jets on the delivery of a living wage for the lowest paid workers in this country. That is all we need to know about where Fine Gael is at at the moment. That was not always the case. Why is it that every small win for working people in this country is framed by Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil as a loss for business? That is not social democracy. That is not the kind of country I believe in and for which I want to fight. It is virtue signalling at its very worst, from a conservative Government that has chosen sides and is damn proud of it. This is a Government that has chosen sides, and it is proud of it, boxing off Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil voters while poor kids, the lowest income families and poor public services will have to wait.",

It should have truly rewarded work by using our wealth, not merely to cut taxes but to cut the cost of childcare, healthcare and education and deliver a real social wage, the thing that really matters for families and working people across this country. It should have heralded the radical step change demanded to build the homes we need. It should have delivered the massive investment we need to make homes warm, invest in renewables and cut emissions. It should have finally decided that, together as a country, we would fix the tattered social contract - the idea that if you work hard and play by the rules, you will get on in life. This budget is the last of this Government's five and it has delivered a resounding \"No\" on all fronts.",
                "Today could have marked a real turning point, the day when Ireland started a journey of real transformation. I cannot remember the number of times I heard the Minister for Finance use the word \"transformation\" or similar words. He did not mean a single word of it. The fiscal decision is stunning but this Government's plans are not. This is a country that is swimming in cash, but this is a budget for the status quo, straight out of the Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil \"Sure, it will be grand\" school of government. Even when we lock away excess business tax receipts, the Apple tax stash and the money from selling a stake in AIB, the surplus is striking. Today is an extraordinary missed opportunity. It is a missed chance to properly paint a picture of a better future. It provides €10 billion in new spending, €6 billion to the two new wealth funds, which we support, and, to top it all off, over €14 billion in an unexpected windfall to spend on future-proofing our country. Yet, with this budget, the Government has managed to make all this look like a problem, not an opportunity. That is one hell of a trick to pull off. It is a budget with no central theme in which nothing adds up. There is no compelling narrative and no ideas, no plan and no burning desire to put our wealth to good, responsible use. If there is a plan, this is just not it.",

The seeds of much of the largesse we are reaping today were sewn many years ago, helped by the Labour Party. This bonanza fell into the Government’s lap. The Minister, Deputy Chambers, was described on “Morning Ireland” today as being a jammy Minister for Finance. “Jammy” is a word that, unfortunately, is underused. It is a great word. It is true that he is jammy, and more power to him, but whereas he needed to use this opportunity wisely, he did not.",

This Government’s record shows that claims of responsible management of the people’s money are wholly unwarranted. I say that for three reasons. Although completely made up to pretend that Fine Gael could let Fianna Fáil back into the house without burning it down, the Government keeps breaking its own 5% spending rule. It will now be a heady 6.9% for 2025. Last year, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil knowingly introduced a health budget that was fraudulent. It was a work of fiction. Only in Ireland would a health Minister responsible for a fictional and fraudulent budget manage to remain in his job. He should have resigned or been sacked. The fiscal gimmickry goes on unabated. Another €4.5 billion was hidden away, described as “contingencies”, and the Government pretends to be taken by surprise every year.",

This Government lacks the ambition and willpower to build enough homes. Ideology is again getting in the way. For once, the Government does not lack financial firepower. The lack of imagination to transform the housing system is amazing and galling. When plan A fails, Darragh O’Brien resorts to plan A. As the Housing Commission's report reads, \"Only a radical strategic reset of housing policy will work.\" What is the solution for the next few years? To listen to the Minister, Deputy O’Brien, it is to extend the help-to-buy scheme. He wanted to increase its limit to more than €500,000, supercharging expensive homes rather than actually addressing the affordability question.",

The residential zoned land tax was the measure we were told would stop that, but it is being delayed again. There is no evidence basis for that, only an ideological one, with the Government looking after the people who vote for it. The tax is being fudged. This is a peculiar fudge. When I read the Minister’s remarks, I was taken by how all a farmer who was actively farming land needed to do was to seek an exemption – the farmer would not actually need to get one – and then it would be left up to local authorities, which will only ever dezone or rezone lands under master plans and county development plans that are developed every five years. Will we have a map of exempted sites? What criteria will apply? If land is serviced and zoned for homes, it must be built on. We have no difficulty with exemptions for farm land, but they need to be transparent.",

We now have the financial firepower to buy up the development sites we have invested in across the country. Let us legislate for the Kenny report and resource the LDA to step in and buy the sites we need. Then we can change the model of development once and for all and build homes in a planned and orderly way when and where they are needed. Private housing supply is being drip-fed into the system at just high enough of a rate to keep it ticking over, but nowhere near high enough to make a dent in the profits of developers and builders. To too many in the sector, housing is seen as an asset to buy and sell, not somewhere to live and raise a family. We need to stop the commodification of housing. The market is doing exactly what the Government’s ideology has set it up to do, namely, create more wealth for asset holders while renters and those trying to have a home of their own get screwed over time and again.",
                "Once again, the Government has made choices. These things do not happen by accident. The Government’s plans for building social and affordable housing raise serious questions. Why are plans still limited to building 10,000 social homes and only 6,400 affordable homes next year? We have the ability, space and capacity to do more, change people’s lives and give people security once and for all. We can build more cost-rental and truly affordable homes. However, the Government is limiting the amount of capital it allocates. The plans for next year are what we in Labour proposed in 2021, and we even admitted then that it would not be enough. That is why Labour has outlined costed plans to bring the targets up to 12,000 social and 10,000 affordable homes per year. It is why we have committed half of the Apple windfall to transforming the Land Development Agency, an initiative that, unlike some others, we supported, into a State construction company to give the State real teeth in the housing market and to building the water infrastructure we need.",
                "The latest wheeze that we read about this week – I am not certain that it found itself into the budget – had to do with measures to encourage living over the shop. We have been discussing this matter for many years. It is time to go back to the drawing board on these issues and do what we used to do. Resource councils with money and staff and they will take over vacant and derelict properties. Dereliction is a disgrace and scandal. It is a form of official vandalism, one almost encouraged by the State by the way we operate and the principle of the primacy of private land. Let us take on those vacant and derelict properties. I note the increase in the vacant levy, but it will be nowhere near enough to disincentivise the hoarding of vacant properties. Those properties need to be brought back into use.",
                "Regarding homelessness, we know that evictions, not immigration, are driving the record levels of family homelessness. The Government will not act to restrict the excuses for eviction, but we know that the cost-rental tenant in situ scheme works and allows families to stay in their homes. Across the country, Labour representatives are hearing about people being denied the chance to live securely under the tenant in situ scheme. There is clearly not enough funding dedicated to it. This is why Labour has proposed to increase it by 20% to 1,800 homes next year. Too much of homelessness funding is spent responding to crises when it is already too late. We need to invest in prevention.",
                "A 5% increase in stamp duty will not stop bulk buying, which has increasingly been stripping homes from the market. Why not make it truly punitive? Who is the Government seeking to protect? Do what my colleague, Senator Sherlock, constantly asks the Government to do and extend the increase to apartments as well. Apartments are homes, too.",
                "There is so much cash sloshing around that the Government does not know what to do with it. Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have decided to give more tax cuts. That is the perennial Fine Gael answer to a question no one asks. If you cannot get your child an assessment of needs, here is a fiver instead. If you cannot get affordable childcare, here is another fiver and it will be grand. These are performative tax cuts when we need performing public services. Look at the polling. People favour public investment in housing, care, climate, education and public transport over the few euro of their own money the Government is planning on giving them back. Not even the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the actual representative of working people, wants tax cuts. We need a decent social wage, one that is worthy of a wealthy republic, but we are instead seeing a race to the bottom between the Government parties and Sinn Féin on tax, not to mention on immigration. This never ends well. Who dares to speak of 2007?",
                "I see Sinn Féin has a new policy to give all carers the carer’s allowance. That was dreamed up overnight to take the bare look off a subpar party leader conference speech. It is Labour’s policy; I do not believe it was in Sinn Féin’s alternative budget, which was launched last Thursday. As Sinn Féin’s embattled leader is prone to say, “Here is the thing” – the USC cut that Sinn Féin proposes would cost €2 billion. That is a full three years of non-means-tested carer’s allowance payments for some of the best and most isolated and underappreciated people in this country. With each day that passes with this approach to tax, immigration and whatever you are having yourself, Sinn Féin’s credibility as a self-described left-wing party becomes more discredited. For a left-wing party, Sinn Féin is quite something. It has rarely met a tax it believes is fair or it did not want to get rid of – USC, the local property tax, taxes on the burning of carbon that is killing the planet. The list goes on.",
                "The €500 million in the Fianna Fáil USC cut of 1% could pay for a full year of targeted child benefit payments to make child poverty history but no, they decided to have a tax cut instead. Labour has no issue with workers' pay going untouched in terms of income tax when they receive a pay rise - that additional piece in terms of the pay rise. That is as it should be. We would allocate €1 billion in a neutral way to do this just this year, but the ever narrowing of the vulnerable tax base is irresponsible. The same people in the Department of Finance and elsewhere who warn us about the concentration risks of our business tax system - they are right - are the very ones who are supporting reckless decisions on tax here today. Every tax cut comes at a cost to someone. This Government will spend almost as much on tax cuts for next year as it will on new public services and on those who rely on the State for their incomes.",
                "The obsession with cutting the thresholds for inheritance tax is a case in point. The Government will spend €88 million of the money that belongs to working people on giving an even more generous tax break to not only children, but to grandchildren too, of those who stand to inherit very valuable properties, and all in the middle of a housing crisis. I can only conclude that Alan Shatter is living in the head of the Minister of State, Deputy Carroll MacNeill. That is the cost of rolling out hot meals to every school in Ireland over the next five years. That is the Government's trade-off. This is where this Government's priorities are. They have made a choice. I understand the Government's argument, even if I disagree with it, but it is not consistent. House prices have gone up, then so must the threshold. That is the Government's logic. I get that. However, wages have gone up too, so why does the Government keep the cap on statutory redundancy for a worker who will lose his or her job at €600 per week and not move it to the €1,000 average it is at now? This has not been reviewed in 20 years. Where is the logic? The inconsistency is appalling. The Government has chosen a side and it is telling the 3% of households who will ever stand to benefit from inheritance tax threshold cuts all about it.",
                "What Labour has made clear is that we would not introduce any unfunded tax cuts. There is scope to tax non-productive wealth such as increases to the bank levy and its application to more firms, greater stamp duty on share buy-backs, etc., to get the balance right and, crucially, to take the heat out of the economy. If I were a member of the Commission on Taxation and Welfare, I would be protesting outside here today because its calls for a rebalancing of the tax take with focus on taxing wealth and harmful behaviours has again fallen on deaf ears.",
                "Let me turn now to once-off measures - the most abused term in recent Irish political history. Inflation is slowing but the price of everything is high, and I agree people still need some help. That we need a series of once-off measures at all is an indictment of this Government, an admission of failure that it did not spend what the dogs in the street knew was needed last October to bring weekly social welfare rates and secondary benefits up to scratch. That means the Minister is back now with the temporary bazooka of cash again. The Government needed to increase all core social welfare weekly rates by €25; it did €12. On Saturday, the Minister had €1.5 billion to lash out. Now, it is over €2 billion. On Sunday, the Minister decided he would give us all back more of our own money, and all because he just has not a clue how to spend and invest it. We truly live in extraordinary times. This explains, for example, the Minister's eleventh hour conversion to Labour's idea in our alternative budget of an extra child benefit double payment. That just was not on the agenda until the cash started burning a hole in the Government's pocket last weekend. It is fiscally wrong to keep going with once-off measures. The scattergun measures have, in fact, put a percentage point onto inflation adding an extra €1,000 a year of cost to households and it is those on low incomes who pay the price when costs go up. That is socially irresponsible. What we have in Ireland is a low incomes problem described by commentators as a cost-of-living crisis and this is exacerbated by a failure of regulation, huge energy prices and price gouging in supermarkets. The list goes on. Fine Gael said last year, for example, that it would legislate, after Labour's campaign, to introduce price transparency on groceries. They have not done so. We cannot keep lashing untargeted wads of cash at the problem, but what we can do is pay workers a living wage, get serious about regulating business, put toothless regulators on the side of consumers for once and fix our broken social protection system.",
                "We must fix social protection. Society has accepted there should be a minimum essential standard of living for all citizens but this conservative Government has not. The nature of the internal coalition social welfare battle and pre-budget leaks were troubling. The arguments were described in the Sunday Independent as ideological. I hope they were. They should be. The fake hard men and women in Fine Gael were saying that pensioners and carers should get more of an increase than the unemployed. A warped version of Fine Gael ideology, the deserving poor versus the work shy, is, I suggest, their line for the news. It is dangerous and unbecoming stuff. It was trumped in the end, in fairness, by a bit of decency from Fianna Fáil and the Green Party - not enough decency, by the way, to provide for a pension that should be set at 34% of average earnings. When €20 increases are needed to maintain the value of the State pension, they give €12. There was a time when the old Fianna Fáil would not stand for this but they have drunk the Fine Gael Kool-Aid on social welfare.",
                "Where is the €25 cost of disability payment, for example, that Labour and others have argued for? This needs to be explained by a Minister who has limited resources available to her. There is now no difference worth talking about between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. They should just go and merge. Fine Gael says its position on a form of indexation for workers on income tax has moved to Labour's position. Their view on the indexation of social welfare rates has not, and it will not.",
                "I must say my heart leaped when Leo Varadkar, on assuming the office of Taoiseach again two years ago, said he would work day and night to tackle the scourge of child poverty. That rhetoric led us to hope for a children's budget to end child poverty. Last year's budget was not it and neither is this. Everyone knows one cannot and should not break a problems to a child, but Fine Gael did. They have broken an earnest promise to the 30,000 children who have been added to the enforced deprivation statistics since Leo Varadkar made those hollow promises in December 2022. Every child inside that cage of poverty that is so hard to break free from need not become an adult shaped by the long tail and lasting effects and shame and stigma, and the physical and psychological long tail, of growing up with nothing. This can change. There are choices. The unit in the Department of the Taoiseach needs to be made real with a plan, cash and action. Last year the qualified child payment went up a mere €4 a week. Labour has argued that this year it should rise by €15 for over 12s and €6 for younger children, on our way to finally deciding to end the misery of absolutely preventable child poverty by fessing up and saying yes, let us spend €700 million a year on that second tier of child benefit. We welcome some of the moves made today. They should have been done last year. However, let us not just rebrand the qualified child payment as something else; make it matter. Let us agree that all children need every chance in life. Let us invest in DEIS plus. Let us invest in genuinely free education. Let us pass Labour's seven-year-old Bill to end family homelessness. Ending child poverty is within our grasp. It has to be a priority for the next Government and be an election issue. It is by no means a priority, though, in this budget. Let us fight an election on ending child poverty, not on ending the USC.",
                "While we are on the subject of children, Labour, it must be said, is flattered by the Taoiseach's new-found interest in publicly-provided childcare. The problem is there is no sign of it in this budget. I cannot help thinking that the Taoiseach is using Government Buildings as a taxpayer-funded laboratory to road test manifesto ideas for Fine Gael. One journalist at the weekend bemoaned - he was right - the lack of big thinking in politics at present, but this is it - big thinking from the Labour Party leader, Ivana Bacik. It is the Niamh Bhreathnach or Donogh O'Malley moment, as it has been described, that we have been waiting for. Let us end the strange Irish exceptionalism that says we cannot have publicly-funded and publicly-run early years services staffed by skilled professionals in public buildings who are paid well and respected. We are Europeans or we are not. Labour would roll out 6,000 public childcare places in year one across 100 services at a first-year operating cost of €53 million. It can be done. This is the kind of transformational thinking absent from Government. There is no sign of it in the budget and no sign of any meaningful interventions to really bring costs down for parents. We are not serious about an equal start for all children and we are not serious about taking the economy to the next level if we are not serious about transforming our early years education system into the kind of system that is taken as read in comparable European countries.",
                "Just like in childcare, the gaps in terms of skills and competitiveness in Ireland are huge. So are the challenges, especially in the SME sector.",
                "If we are to sustain our economic success and be competitive, we have to invest in future skills, in work training and apprenticeships. I see there is only a 33% short-term cut in apprenticeship fees. Our PRSI levy-based National Training Fund is heading for a surplus of €2 billion, and that is a good thing. Now we see what the Government's plan is to fund third level. It seems it is to keep third level going by raiding that fund at the expense of other initiatives. We want to see free third level for everyone and we need to invest in in-work training too. We have no difficulty with taking some money from the National Training Fund to invest in third level, but it should not only be for third level.",
                "Before handing over to my colleague, Deputy Duncan Smith, I note our view is that the parties of the status quo are simply incapable of fixing the problems we have. The evidence is all around us in housing, lack of progress in offshore wind, anaemic retrofitting programmes, creaking water services and an energy grid not able to meet our current or future demands. The Parliamentary Budget Office report produced last week was very interesting. It states that despite all of this largesse, this Government will invest less in infrastructure than we did in 2008. This is damning. At no point between now and 2030 will those spending plans come close to that 2008 figure. That is truly shocking. Ireland's second century must be an era of investment and that can only be led by parties that believe in their hearts, and know in their minds that only the power of the State has the capacity, the mandate and the authority to do the truly big things we need to see happen, that is, the things that can truly transform Ireland. I note what the Government stated earlier today about the use of money from AIB shares and the Apple tax. Labour will make its case to be part of the next Government, a Government that for once in our history, will have the capacity to truly transform Ireland. We have made it clear how we would deploy the Apple tax money. We have the courage of our convictions and the experience to do so. We would spend €7 billion on housing to seed a State housing construction company through the existing Land Development Agency, with €1 billion of that to support the water network to service land. There would be two-and-a-half billion euro to make major transformative transport projects such as metro, Luas, BusConnects and DART+ happen and €1 billion so the State could invest to make offshore wind generation happen, as well as cutting emissions, keeping homes warm and slashing energy prices and helping to create an industry and new sustainable jobs and businesses. We would fund a street-by-street retrofitting revolution that will matter and deploy €1 billion to create a Sláintecare transition fund, half of which Labour would use to roll out digital health records to make our health service work better for patients and staff alike. This is the level of ambition and clarity of purpose we need to truly change Ireland, an ambition that only Labour has."

                "The Government has done a remarkable job trying to frame this budget as a budget that has no losers and only winners, that it is a budget that will benefit everyone, particularly children and families. If we look beyond our shores economically, we can see that the three largest economies in Europe, namely, Germany, France and the UK, are facing gloomy economic predictions of varying degrees. What are we doing in Ireland with this budget? We are shrinking the tax base. We are inflating our spending and funding this through windfall taxes. That is what we are doing. We have been down this road before, and we know where it ends. This is a \"when I have it, I’ll spend it\" splurge of a budget, giving people back their own money in exchange for short-term votes and support. People will welcome any money that is going back into their pockets because no sooner is that in their pockets, it will be in the accounts of utility companies, the tills of supermarkets or used in trying to knock off a few bob from that credit union loan that had to be taken out just to get through the cost-of-living crisis people are still enduring. That is what this budget is doing. Where will the people who are supposed to benefit from this budget be in a couple of weeks' time or months' time? They will be in the exact same place they were yesterday, because that money will be gone to chase their tails.",
                "The Government has positioned this budget to cover and help an awful lot of people and states it will only have winners. However, here are some losers. Nine-year-old children and above, who for their entire lives have benefited from the free GP care scheme will age out in massive numbers now, because Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil are not committed to free GP care, which was one of the greatest universalisations of healthcare in this country when it was first introduced by the Labour Party for those up to six years of age. It was only over the past eight years that two years were added. That has seemingly stopped. If you are a child on a waiting list for an autism class, this budget is of no use to you. It will not deliver any extra places or autism classes in any school in this country. There are just over 3,000 primary schools in our country. Only 1,000 of them provide autism classes. This budget does not rectify that in any real way, shape or form. If you are waiting for an assessment of need, about which there are some words in the Budget Statement, there is no detail because every budget delivered by this Government has had words about the assessment of needs waiting list. Yet, we still have huge waiting lists. Again, if you or your child is on that waiting list, they will remain on that waiting list because this budget will not help you. If you are waiting for speech and language therapy, OT or physiotherapy you will still be waiting because there is no detail in the delivery of the therapies and specialists needed to get those waiting lists down. If your child is waiting to be seen by CAMHS this budget will do nothing for you. If you are a medical card holder and currently unable to access dental treatment, this budget again has no detail that it is going to deliver for you. If you are a long-term carer about to lose your carer's allowance because your annual household income is marginally over the means test, this budget does nothing for you. That means test needs to go.",
                "If you are a young worker hoping to enter one of our care professions in either a voluntary, community or acute setting this budget does nothing for you. I do not know if the Minister for Health, or any Minister or senior member of the Government was over in Buswells speaking to student nurses. They are referenced in the document, which says there will be more funding for student nurses. The issues with student nurses relate to their pay, to how they are working and that they have to take shifts as healthcare assistants, usually on the same wards where they are doing their student placement. When they are doing their healthcare assistant shifts, they are being asked to act up for nursing responsibilities, which means the very important job of healthcare assistant is not being done. This budget does not help that problem. What we needed was a workforce budget, a budget that was going to develop our workforce. That is not sexy or eye catching, but that is what this country needs."

Our trolley count is a crude, but powerful, indicator of the health of our health service, and 576 people on trolleys on the first day of October is a near record for the first day of this month. We need new staff but we also need to keep existing staff. They are overworked and underpaid. This is the reality of our healthcare workers and nothing in this budget is dealing with that fundamental problem. I acknowledge this budget document states there will be investment in a number of healthcare strategies, which is welcome. The cancer strategy, for example, has gone underfunded for a number of years. It requires €20 million but in this document, it is included with the stroke strategy - again, vitally needed - the maternity strategy, the women's health action plan, the dementia strategy, the breastfeeding strategy and the palliative care strategy. All these strategies need to be developed and funded. There is no detail on the funding for these strategies. These are not documents that stay on a shelf and do nothing. Strategies in these areas help deliver healthcare and help save and prolong lives.",

We are at 50% of the level of clinical trials in Denmark, for example. We are so far behind in that regard and that is because we are not funding those strategies. Will the Government please provide the detail, the funding and the strategies? We are falling behind.",
                "My colleague, Deputy Nash, spoke about the investment in electronic health records. Again, this is something that will really deliver healthcare outcomes. It will stop the need for repeated X-rays and repeated therapies, the duplication or tripling of work, and will actually ensure timely diagnostics and delivery of healthcare. This should not be long-fingered.",
                "Regarding the hot school meals programme, this is one of the best things the Government has done. It is brilliant. I am glad it is being extended. What I like about it is, not only does it do what it says on the tin and makes sure every child that gets it is getting a hot school meal, but it is egalitarian. These pupils, these kids, are sharing the same experience. There is no difference. A son or daughter of privilege is having the same meal or at least getting something from the same menu as the son and daughter of a parent in direct provision. That is a good thing. We are a bit concerned with the holiday hunger pilot project next summer. It is not about the actual scheme itself. It should be rolled out but calling it the holiday hunger scheme lacks a bit of compassion. It takes away from what is good about the hot school meals scheme. Call it the summer meals scheme or call it something else. These children know better than anyone else that they are hungry. They will not need a scheme named that or see it printed on a box. Will the Minister of State take that point away? That kind of compassion is something that is needed.",
                "On transport, this budget is so devoid of vision and ambition. We have thousands of people who are waiting at bus stops and on platforms for buses that are not turning up and trains that do not have enough carriages. The problem is not just a timetable change; it is capacity, tracks, carriages, buses, workers and drivers. We do not have them and this budget is not going to deliver them in the slightest. This budget will deliver a shrinking of our tax base and an increase in spending and is doing it with windfall taxes. It is bringing our economy to a place that is precarious. Best of luck to the Government on these economics outlooks that will be put in the budget documents over the next five or six year. Hopefully, they will be delivered."

We have lots of breathless reporting of the gargantuan surplus figure, that €25 billion, and the complex array of one-off measures. However, looking a little deeper, it quickly becomes clear that the emperor has no clothes. Never has a Government had so much and done so little. Plenty of cash has been splashed around but mainly in one-off measures. All of these payments will certainly be very welcome, particularly at this time of year, but they will not last very long. What happens then? When happens when the bonus payments dry up and prices are continuing to rise? Will homes be any more affordable? Will rents come down at all? Will healthcare be easier to access? Will childcare places be affordable or more available? Will disability services for children with additional needs be more accessible? Will older people be better supported to live at home? Will child poverty be seriously reduced? We also have to ask will the huge inequality that exists in our society be addressed in any meaningful way? Will we be any closer to meeting our climate targets? Will any of it make any long-term positive difference? Will the country work any better? The answer, in the main, is \"No\". This budget has just one overriding purpose, that is, the self-preservation of the Government parties. A whole plethora of one-off payments are set to be made just before, or during, when we all expect a general election. It is a bit on the nose, even for this spin-obsessed Government. You do not need to be Sherlock Holmes to work out the rationale behind all of this.",
                "I read recently that the Taoiseach met the former Fianna Fáil leader, Bertie Ahern, in recent days. He invited him in to Government Buildings for a fireside chat. That is also quite instructive because this has all the hallmarks of a Bertie budget. Spray money around, create a distraction and hope that it is enough to win an election. However, I do not think people are that easily fooled. The Government is underestimating them. People can see that what the Government is trying to do is textbook electioneering, that is, to use people's own money to buy their votes. Worse, the Government is selling people short. Essentially, all they are getting is a few extra quid in their pockets, which will quickly be gobbled up in cost-of-living increases. It is a bad deal for the public and for the State finances. We all know the only way to significantly drive down costs for everyone is by investing in proper public services. We need to ensure people, all through their lives, have a strong social safety net through which no one is allowed to fall. We need genuinely free education, affordable housing, accessible healthcare, reliable public transport, affordable childcare and strong social care delivered in the community. Imagine for a moment what the country could look like were the social contract to be honoured and not left in tatters, as the Government is doing. That is the kind of vision and ambition we need in this country but it is not, by any means, what this Government has delivered. Regrettably, the Government prefers quick fixes instead of structural reforms and it is really shameful that, yet again, it has failed to target measures at those who need them most. The energy credits are the most stark example of this. These will be going to many people who do not actually need them, just as in previous years. After today's announcement, how much of this State largesse will have been funnelled to the owners of holiday homes? The answer is more than €90 million. In comparison, the Government ring-fenced only €19 million for spinal surgeries for children with scoliosis, which it could not even ensure was used for that purpose.",
                "This is the Ireland of today, under this Government, where children on long waiting lists live in agony for years, with their health deteriorating while resources are frittered away elsewhere. They are frittered away on bonus payments and energy credits for the wealthiest in our society, heaped on top of the bonfire of public money that is the endless budget for the children’s hospital, or spent on a bike shed that cost nearly €350,000, a security hut for €1.5 million or €500,000 modular homes. Not only is the Government engaged in a spending splurge unlike any other, but any value-for-money considerations have been left at the door.",

We were told that eradicating child poverty was a priority for the Government, as the Minister of State may remember. At least, that is what the former Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, said. He even published a plan in 2023, From Poverty to Potential: A Programme Plan for Child Poverty and Well-being. What actually happened? The number of children experiencing deprivation actually increased by 15% in the last year. One in five children is now living in a home where the family cannot afford to heat the home or afford two pairs of properly fitting shoes. Those on the Government benches, who were grinning from ear to ear earlier, should pause for a moment and think about that. On their watch, more children have fallen below the poverty line. The record budget surpluses do not mean anything to them because they have not benefited from all of this funding. The reason is simple. The Government has failed to target it at those who need it most. It ignored all of the expert advice - from the Children’s Rights Alliance, St. Vincent de Paul, the ESRI and others - and preferred to spray money indiscriminately rather than direct it to those who need it most.",
                "In 2023, a welfare payment that goes to the State’s most vulnerable children was increased by a miserly €2 a week. Last year, that figure was increased to just €4. This year, the Government has managed an increase of €8 but it is not nearly enough. In our alternative budget, the Social Democrats proposed increasing this rate by €15, nearly double the Government’s paltry figure. We did that because those children desperately need this support. We also proposed a range of other measures, like a public model of childcare, increased childcare subsidies for the most disadvantaged children, a new DEIS+ categorisation for schools and an increase in the threshold of the working family payment of €40.",
                "I do not see much of that in this document. Instead, everyone - the richest families and the poorest - get largely the same child supports and two double child benefit payments. I listened to the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, explaining the rationale for this on the “This Week” programme on RTÉ radio on Sunday, and I have to say that I was quite appalled by her. She made some reference to Christmas coming up and parents being under pressure to buy toys because of all the catalogues coming in the letterbox. Did she not listen before she spoke to the clip where parents of children with disabilities were crying out for basic specialist services? Does she not realise that, for some parents, the biggest struggle is not to buy the latest toy? It is to keep a roof over their children’s heads, make a choice between heating their home or cooking a meal, or buy a winter coat or new shoes. The level of disconnection from the reality of many people’s lives is extraordinary. What kind of bubble is the Government living in? Does the real world ever get a look in? We all know, or at least we should know, that the first few years of a child’s life can largely determine the rest of it. If we get those early years right, so much harm later in life can be avoided. Is it just that this Government cannot be bothered to target these resources or is it that it is so obsessed with trying to buy the next election that it no longer cares about those important things?",
                "We see the same stubborn refusal to tackle low pay. Ireland has a real problem with low pay. Hundreds of thousands of people subsist week to week on incomes that are not sufficient to live a dignified existence. Included in this number are the one fifth of workers who were promised by the Government that a living wage would be introduced by 2026. Where does that commitment lie now, given we are nowhere near delivering on it? I did not see any reference to it in the budget bonanza. If the Government wanted to make a genuine effort to reach that target, it needed a much bigger minimum wage increase than the 80 cent announced today. The Social Democrats proposed an increase of €1.30 to €14 per hour and committed to replacing the minimum wage with a living wage in next year’s budget.",
                "Increases to core social welfare rates, well above the €12 announced today, should also have been a priority. Instead of adequately increasing core rates and helping people in the long term, the Government reverted to its preferred approach of short-termism and one-offs. For months now, we have heard figures being bandied about in relation to social welfare increases, and figures from €10 to €20 were cited. However, despite endless commentary, I never saw any analysis of what the appropriate figure should be for such increases. Social welfare increases should not just be at the discretion of individual Ministers. They should be taken out of the hands of politicians altogether and benchmarked to the minimum essential standard of living. To do that, a weekly increase of €48 needs to be delivered over a reasonable period. If we were in government, the Social Democrats would have charted a course to get there over two years, and we proposed to start with a €25 per week increase this year. This would make a huge difference to those who are most at risk of poverty - pensioners, lone parents, disabled people and those who have lost their jobs. Again, however, the Government preferred half-measures. After some cynical politicking from Fine Gael and attempting to vilify those who have lost their jobs as somehow unworthy of support, the rate is increasing by just €12 per week across the board. It is a figure that has seemingly been plucked out of the sky by the coalition partners because it sounds a bit better than a tenner. Optics and arbitrariness are the Government's key concerns when framing the budget.",
                "I will move on to the tax package. If there is a theme running through the tax measures in this budget, it is this: the more you have, the more you get from this Government. Those earning €75,000 will benefit in this budget to the tune of €20 per week while those barely scraping by on €30,000 will get €5 per week. Equity and fairness are entirely absent. What we have seen in recent budgets from the Government is that very principle, the more you have, the more you get. The net result is that the gap between rich and poor has widened. We have become less equal and less cohesive as a society and, therefore, less successful. Instead of disproportionately heaping benefits at the top, the Social Democrats proposed an alternative, namely, increasing tax credits by €450 and making them refundable so the benefit was shared equally. This approach would have cost the State much less, just one-third of the Government’s tax package.",
                "Income tax is not the only area, of course, but it is essential that we do not erode the tax base that we have.",
                "The Government has been warned of that by various agencies, yet it continues to erode the tax base year after year.",
                "This is not the only area where the Government is looking after the better off. In fact, it could be said it is the only part of the budget where the Government made a real effort to target support. The increase in the threshold for inheritance tax is very targeted at a wealthy minority because the vast majority of people will never have to pay inheritance tax, despite scaremongering to the contrary. The idea that children inheriting a house might have to sell their home or face homelessness to pay the charge is bogus, as fair exemptions are already in place for to avoid this. Inheritance is not earned; it is received based on an accident of birth, yet we give it greatly favourable tax treatment when compared to productive activities like work. We do not tax wealth very much in Ireland; now we will tax it even less. Fewer than 3% of households ever receive an inheritance greater than the old threshold of €335,000. Now even fewer will pay inheritance tax and it is the better off who are being spared.",
                "Gold-plated pension pots is also an area that has seen an intervention from this Government. It has moved to ensure that pension pots in excess of €2 million will not face a tax penalty. This is yet another targeted measure to benefit less than 1% of our population. Just like with inheritance tax, it seems that a well-publicised lobbying campaign getting blanket media coverage has done the trick. Soundbites and a misrepresentation of data, have proven more influential on policy than any kind of sound analysis.",
                "We can get one thing straight: any suggestion that anyone would end up financially worse-off from taking promotions, if the standard fund threshold for pensions were not increased, is wrong. People whose pension benefits cross the threshold might face higher marginal rates, not higher overall rates, but those apply solely on the amount over the threshold, which was an already generous €2 million. This is an amount only a tiny fraction of people can ever hope to save for their retirement. Nobody would be worse off. Candidates will indeed get higher pensions. They were simply facing higher rates of tax than they expected or were lobbying for. All this move represents is an underhanded way of giving extra money to the highest paid civil servants in the country. I just wonder how many of those higher-paid civil servants had a hand in devising this change in policy. This gives an additional tax break that will be worth more than €300,000 per person to some of the best paid people in the private sector by 2030.",
                "I also want to say something about tax proposals from Sinn Féin. It is important to refer to what Sinn Féin is proposing because the Government parties are not the only ones with big tax packages in their budgets. Sinn Féin’s alternative budget outlined a tax package worth an enormous €2 billion. Sinn Féin has flagged plans to scrap the property tax, the carbon tax and to cut the universal social charge, USC. That is quite cynical and very hard to understand from a party that claims to be left wing. It is very cynical because one cannot promise to radically improve public services and slash taxes at the same time. People are not that stupid. They get that, even if some in this House fail to understand that. Our public services desperately need investment. We cannot repeat the mistakes of the past and bet the house on transient corporation tax windfalls that could disappear at some point in the not-too-distant future.",
                "The need for investment is particularly acute in disability services. As it stands, 15,000 children are waiting for their first contact from a children’s disability network team. Tens of thousands more of those children are being denied essential services. That is a shameful indictment of the Government’s term of office. The most vulnerable left on waiting lists are denied critical supports to live a life with dignity and to have any chance of realising their full potential. This is all happening while enormous sums slosh around in the Government coffers.",
                "If the Social Democrats were in government, disability services would have more than ten times the investment that has been flagged by the Government because this is a sector that really needs it and we can afford to do it. Included in our priorities in this area is a €30 per week cost-of-disability payment. This would be on top of the €25 increase in disability payment. This would mean that core payments made to disabled people would increase by €55 per week. Compare that to the €12 announced with great fanfare by the Government.",
                "This level of increase is necessary because having a disability is very expensive. The Government published a report in 2021 that put the figure at an additional annual €13,100. Why did it bother commissioning that research if it was not going to do anything about it? It is yet another report sitting on a shelf gathering dust somewhere rather than being implemented. The Government has done virtually nothing to address the enormous additional costs faced by disabled people. One-off disability payments are not sufficient. Having a disability is not one-off or temporary and the Minister of State should not need to be reminded of that. Why then are these payments being made? The Government’s dismissive attitude to disabled people is perhaps best reflected in the fact that personal transport schemes that were axed by the Fine Gael-Labour Government a decade ago have yet to replaced. That says it all. That level of inertia and ineptitude is quite shocking. We all know that disabled people are more likely to suffer from isolation and poverty. One in five people unable to work due to disability live in consistent poverty. This is almost four times higher than the national average. Where are the measures in this budget to address that scandal? I do not see any and that is absolutely shameful.",
                "I have also looked through this document to find the measures that will deliver affordable homes but they seem to be missing too. Of course, that is mainly because the Government persists with the delusion that homes costing €500,000 are somehow affordable. When starting out with that bizarre perspective, there is no hope of addressing the affordability crisis in any kind of meaningful way. My colleague Deputy O’Callaghan will speak about housing in a great deal more depth shortly.",
                "When it comes to the health service, I am glad to see that the Government has opted not to run that service next year with an enormous built-in deficit just as it did last year, which the House will recall. It is incredible that last year the budget contained a €1.5 billion black hole in health. The budget for the health service is large and we must ensure accountability but a reform programme costs money and investment now will pay dividends in the future. As it stands, there are too many who cannot access health services when they need them. There are too many people on lengthy waiting lists for treatment. There are too few primary care centres working in communities. The scandal of tens of thousands of people languishing on trolleys persists. Critical programmes, such as the cancer strategy, have been starved of funding and regional disparities in the availability of acute care continue. This also applies to home care supports.",
                "We cannot stand over a situation in which the midwest region is denied the resources in funding and staff that are available elsewhere.",
                "It was intriguing to hear the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, speak earlier when he referred to an increase in health staffing levels to over 130,000 staff. The current approved staff ceiling, however, is 129,753. It sounds very strange. By how many people are we actually going to increase the childcare staff? Increases in capacity at primary care level are especially important. I would like to hear from the Government what exactly they are talking about. How much over 130,000 does it intend going? Key to that is how many over 130,000 the Government is prepared to fund.",
                "One has to ask why this Government cannot take the long view and tackle the kind of fundamental problems that are facing this country. Instead, the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that these surpluses represent are wasted in this budget, mainly because of ephemeral, one-off payments. Why has the Government wasted those opportunities? We were in a position to do something of real consequence in relation to services in this country, to make it a more united country, to make it a fairer country, and to make it a more cohesive country. The Government has wasted those opportunities.",
                "So many people are again being left behind in this budget when they should have been the priority. When the dust settles on the splurge and when the one-off payments have been spent where will it leave us? I ask people to think ahead to next February or March. Will any of the major issues we are facing as a society such as housing, healthcare, disability services, climate action, inequality, or the lack of accountability, be better? Regrettably, I believe the answer to that question is a resounding \"No\". This budget is the ultimate in short-termism. It is a cynical, blatant and reckless attempt to buy votes on the cheap and to hell with the consequences that appear. Truly this is a Bertie budget. It is a Bertie budget for the ages."

                "Never before has the opportunity or the need for action from Government to address the housing crisis been so great and never before has the opportunity for Government to address the housing crisis been so great. The Housing Commission in its report published in May stated very clearly that we need 60,000 new homes a year to be delivered. Currently only about half of that is being delivered. This budget presented the Government with a great and golden opportunity to take radical and decisive action to ensure we get enough housing, and particularly affordable housing, that is desperately needed in this country. There is a generation watching on today who are stuck at home in their childhood bedrooms. This generation is absolutely horrified at a Government that has failed to grasp this moment and this opportunity. This budget is a real kick in the teeth for renters who are paying exorbitant rents, for every adult stuck in his or her childhood bedroom, and for every person who is currently experiencing homelessness or who is in fear of becoming homeless.",
                "The context of this budget for housing and for renters is that when Fine Gael took office initially someone looking to rent a place faced paying an average rent of €757. Now the average rent has risen to a whopping €1,612. Since this Government has taken office house prices have increased by more than €80,000. Home ownership is at its lowest level in more than 50 years. Back in 1991 Ireland had one of the highest home ownership rates in Europe at about 80%. In just 30 years that has fallen to 66% and is continuing to fall. At the same time the Government continues to subsidise and encourage expensive rental-only developments that are owned by international funds where there is no option at all for people to buy. This is a direct result of what the Government is doing, and indeed what it is failing to do.",
                "There are now 14,486 people who are homeless and living in emergency accommodation. When Fine Gael took office this number was still too high but it was 3,808. This is a 280% increase since Fine Gael has taken office. Rough sleeping in Dublin in the last year, not including the numbers of international protection applicants, has increased by 56% under this Government. Child homelessness has reached record levels and yet the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, told us earlier that this Government wants Ireland to be one the best countries in the world to be a child. If the Government is serious about that, it could start by tackling child homelessness and eliminating child homelessness but we do not see measures in the budget to do this.",
                "When we talk of all these numbers it is important to remember there are humans behind these numbers. Last week I attended an event organised by the Simon Community. I met two people who had previously been homeless, had come out of that, and are now in housing. They talked of the trauma they experienced in homeless emergency accommodation and how they will never recover from that. They spoke of how every week they count themselves lucky to be alive and how utterly traumatised and scarred they were by the experience of having no personal space, of not having proper support and care, and of feeling constantly under threat. These are just two of the people behind the staggering numbers this Government is responsible for. All of this is happening in the context of a budget surplus of €25 billion that could be used to end homelessness and to build the tens of thousands of affordable social homes that we desperately need to fix this housing crisis. There are more than enough resources available to fully fund the Social Democrats affordable housing plan, which would see us build 50,000 affordable-purchase homes over the next few years, in addition to what can be delivered in social housing and by private housing delivery. There is simply no excuse not to tackle the housing crisis in this budget and yet the Government has failed to do this.",
                "On the specific measures in this budget, the pathetic 5% increase in stamp duty announced by the Government on the bulk purchase of homes shows it is simply not serious about tackling this at all and does not want to stamp out the practice of multi-billion euro funds snapping up homes, pushing up prices and pushing out first time buyers. For example, we saw this happening earlier this year in my constituency in Belcamp Manor where 85% of the new homes were snapped up by a fund. What action did the Government take at that time? None at all. It has taken them all year to come up with a paltry 5% increase in stamp duty, which they know will not be effective. It is worth remembering that this stamp duty applies to funds which buy homes that are already built and already exist. These are homes that could and should have been made available to individuals and families to buy. Last year we saw a 56% increase in the number of homes bought up by these funds paying the ineffective stamp duty rate. It shows yet again that the Government is not serious about tackling this and that the Government is on the side of the funds, not the side of those people who are desperately trying to find an affordable place to live.",
                "This budget also fails to take any action on the large subsidies and tax subsidies in place for international funds and investors. This is especially the case when it comes to the tax subsidies that international funds and REITs enjoy. Let us be very clear that favourable tax treatment for these funds is a subsidy. That is what it is. The situation is that REITs pay no capital gains tax, no corporation tax and no tax on the rental income. International investors and funds who are investing into REITs pay virtually no tax at all in this State while extracting huge profits from rental incomes. This highly favourable tax regime for international investors is unjust.",
                "It is a slap in the face for every Irish worker who contributes, through taxation, to fund our public services. The Social Democrats proposed a levy on REITs to ensure that they would at least make some contribution towards our services with the profits they make. Is there another country in the world that subsidises large international funds in this way to provide very expensive rental accommodation? I do not believe there is. Other countries put their subsidies and supports into affordable housing to make sure there is more available for people. It is no wonder that, under this Government, rents, house prices and rates of homelessness have never been higher given that it is subsidising funds that are making huge profits by extracting very high rents.",
                "Part of the sweetheart deals is how the Government backs long-term leasing deals as a further subsidy to these funds. In today's budget there was no fanfare from the Government on this. It was just buried in the detail. We have seen the Government breaking the commitment it gave over the last few years on long-term leasing. Time and again, the Government has told us it is winding down long-term leasing, these sweetheart deals that ensure that, over 20 or 30 years, the State pays the entire cost of financing a home yet leaves the investment fund with full ownership at the end. This is incredibly bad value for money but, of course, we have come to expect this from the Government. It is not interested in value for money. It has presided over a bike shed being built that cost more than a new home. Value for money seems to mean nothing to this Government. We were promised that these sweetheart leasing deals would be wound down, yet today the Government announces 7,400 new long-term leasing deals over the next year. This is on top of the 38,000 long-term leasing deals the State has already signed up for. This measure is simply a bailout for developers doing projects that are otherwise not viable to build. What the State should be doing is buying these sites that are not viable and building social and affordable housing on them instead. The approach being taken by the Government is the worst possible in terms of value for money. In 20 or 30 years, when these loans have been paid off by the taxpayer, we will not own a single one of these homes. This bankrolling of developers and bailing out of speculators with these sweetheart deals simply cannot be justified.",
                "The vacant homes tax increase from 0.51% to 0.72% is pathetic and will not act as a deterrent to anyone sitting on a property and watching its value increase by about 10% per year by doing nothing. It is yet another half-hearted measure by the Government to make it look like it is doing something about the housing crisis. As we have been saying repeatedly, we need a vacancy tax with teeth to bring thousands of vacant homes back into use. In our alternative budget, the Social Democrats proposed a vacancy tax of 10%, which would be effective. It is time to stop fiddling around with tiny increases year after year and to take the housing, homelessness and vacancy crises seriously.",
                "On housing adaptation grants, I welcome the Government announcement that the income threshold and maximum grant will increase. Housing adaptation grants are an excellent support to help people to stay in their homes and continue to live independently. They are very good for people's well-being and health. That being said, these measures are long overdue. The grants have failed to keep up with significant levels of housing construction inflation. The review into housing adaptation grants was due to be published before the end of 2022. Why has it taken the Government two years to act on this? Was it simply holding back on this decision and much-needed announcement because it wanted to announce some good news a few weeks before an election was called?",
                "It is not simply a question of the thresholds and maximum grants. The number of grants being awarded needs to be looked at. The Government funded fewer housing adaptation grants in 2024 than in 2010. What has happened between 2010 and 2024? There has been a huge increase in the number of people aged 65 and over, with a rise of almost 300,000 people in the last 14 years. The fact that fewer grants are now being awarded is highly significant and the Government should be tackling it. There are significant waiting lists for the housing adaptation grants. People simply cannot wait. If someone needs a chair-lift to get up and down stairs and stay in their home, they should not be left waiting. The Department gave a commitment in 2019 to publish data about waiting lists. We are still waiting on that commitment to be honoured. We know that information published by ALONE under the Freedom of Information Act showed several local authorities with significant waiting lists. ALONE estimates that up to 5,000 people are affected. We need an increase in the number of grants awarded and we need the information about the waiting lists to be published and for measures to be taken on this issue.",
                "Never before has the opportunity for a Government to fix our housing crisis been so great. Never before has the need been so great, with record rents, house prices, numbers of people living in homeless emergency accommodation and record numbers of children growing up without a home. Never before has the need been so great and never before have so many resources been available to tackle this and has such an opportunity to tackle this been squandered. The Government had an open goal to take action on the housing crisis in this budget. Not only has it failed to get the ball into the back of the net, it appears the Government is not even on the pitch when it comes to fixing the housing crisis."

                "Incredibly, after the Housing Commission said we needed to double our housing output, which means at least doubling social and affordable housing output, the Government figures for social and affordable housing for next year announced in today's budget are the same as those for this year. There has been no change from the Housing for All plan, which has failed disastrously. Last year, the target was 10,000 social homes and 6,000 affordable homes. The target next year is 10,000 social homes and 6,000 affordable homes. There has been no change. That is absolutely incredible. The Government is planning to put an additional €4 billion on top of what it has just put into the Future Ireland Fund and the infrastructure fund before the end of year instead of putting that money into doubling the amount of social and affordable housing to be delivered, which is what is needed next year and for at least five or ten years afterwards. That is absolutely stunning. It explains why the Government refused for six months to discuss the Housing Commission's report. It refused point-blank because the consequences of actually having a discussion on it would have been to admit that, as the commission has outlined, the Housing for All plan accounts for less than half of what is necessary to deliver a solution to the absolutely catastrophic housing and homelessness crisis, which is getting worse by the day and which requires us to at least double social and affordable housing output.",
                "There is no action in the budget to deal with the unaffordable rents being charged. These are now well over €2,000 a month. There is a paltry increase in the tax credit but all of this is money going into the pockets of corporate landlords while rents are racing upwards. It will make no difference. It will just about keep people at the same level of extortionate rent they are already at. What is necessary is for us to cut rents or to deliver social and affordable housing on the scale necessary to allow people not to be dependent on these vulture funds and corporate landlords, which are charging rents that no reasonable person could be expected to pay or afford.",
                "There is no action to deal with unaffordable house prices. Whatever additional money is going into the help-to-buy scheme or any of these other schemes is money that is just going to pour into the pockets of developers and vulture funds. There is no action to deal with the profiteering and speculation of those who control land and the supply of housing in this country. It is shameful that, when the capital resources are available to establish a State construction company that could build social and affordable housing on the public land bank, the Government has failed to do so. We will therefore remain dependent on private developers and investors to deliver the supply of housing, including most social and affordable housing. We are still dependent on private contractors and developers when, even with the best will in the world, they do not have the capacity to deliver what is necessary. Even if they wanted to, they do not have the scale. In any event, what they deliver is too expensive, coming in at shockingly high prices. The development at Shanganagh in my area sums it up. So-called affordable housing is priced at €340,000 to €380,000. That is not affordable but that is all they are capable of delivering because the Government will not deal with the fundamental problem, which is that people who are out for profit control the land bank and are controlling the supply of housing and the capacity to build it. They are only interested in the profit they can make from other people's housing misery. We needed to use this money to develop a State construction company to build on public land and to control the profiteering of those charging exorbitant rents and prices for housing. While it is not a budgetary measure, it also would have stopped the flow of people being evicted from the private rented sector into homelessness.",
                "The Government boasts that it has boosted the health service budget. While it has indeed gone up in nominal terms, from €22.3 billion to €25.3 billion, it must be taken into account that the Government seriously underbudgeted for health last year and then had to introduce a supplementary budget of €1.5 billion. Inflation must also be taken into account. My God, the Government is certainly not able to control health inflation. Never mind bike sheds and all the rest of it, look at the scale of inflation on the national children's hospital. When you add in demographic changes, an older population and all the rest of it, it becomes clear that there is not enough here to stem the crisis in our health service, the misery of the nearly 1 million people who are waiting for procedures, the chaos in our emergency departments and the chronic understaffing in our hospitals and in multiple areas of our health service, including our CAMHS teams, our children's disability networks and public health nursing. There are deficits in all of these areas and many more. These are not going to be addressed.",
                "There is an issue I have raised before and I believe Fórsa workers are protesting about it later this week. Having announced the lifting of the recruitment embargo it imposed on the health service, in June of this year, the Government reintroduced that embargo under a different name - the pay and numbers strategy. A ceiling, a maximum number of staff that can be recruited into the health service, is again going to be imposed next year. According to the budget book, this will be set at 133,000. The Minister says this is an increase of 3,000 on last year but, as the INMO has pointed out, the pay and numbers staff ceiling imposed in June set staffing levels at the same levels as December 2023, meaning that this year would, in the area of nursing and midwifery alone, see an effective cut of 2,000 in the whole-time equivalent number of nurses and midwives. I am sure that, along with the rest of the areas of chronic understaffing, this will more than account for the so-called increases we are looking at.",
                "The reality is that the Government is imposing a ceiling that has nothing to do with patient safety or safe staffing numbers, which is what our healthcare workers and professionals have been telling us is needed. It is obvious when you go into the hospitals. Maternity leave and sick leave are not being covered in many hospitals. When people retire, staff are not being recruited to replace them. People are being pulled all over the hospital to cover for a lack of staffing in one area or another. People are often doing things they are not even trained to do, endangering patient safety. That is the reality of what is going on and it results from the imposition of an effective embargo through the setting of these staff ceilings. There is nothing in this budget that suggests the Government has any intention of increasing staffing levels, sanctioning posts and recruiting the people necessary to get us up to safe staffing levels, which should be the baseline for the funding of the health service. What is going to ensure patient safety? What is going to ensure that health workers have conditions that do not leave them completely demoralised, stressed and overrun? The situation for many of them is so bad that they just do not want to work in the health service and so head off to other countries.",
                "The mental health budget is still less than 6% of the overall health budget, even though it has been stated time and again that we need to get the mental health budget up to at least 10% of the overall health budget.",
                "Another really shocking feature of a budget where the Government has this enormous surplus of more than €20 billion and another projected surplus of €9 billion next year, is that, very importantly, it is coming against the background of staggering increases in the profits of the big corporations in this country and an enormous accumulation in the wealth of the very richest in Irish society. This has taken place under successive Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Governments over the last ten or 15 years. In a context where we have the resources that could eliminate poverty and give working people a break, the Government has given them crumbs. The European Anti-Poverty Network, for example, looking at the €12 increase, has said that to get the real value of the basic social welfare or pension payment just back to the level it was at in 2020, there would have needed to have been a minimum of a €20 increase on the basic payment. The Government has given the increase of €12. The €20 increase would just have been to get us back to where we were in 2020.",
                "People remain in poverty, therefore, and will remain in poverty. That €12 increase will not cover the accumulated cost-of-living hikes that people have endured and suffered over the last several years since this crisis took off. This was a period during which, I repeat, profits went through the roof and the accumulation of the wealth in the hands of the richest in this country increased absolutely dramatically. As we highlighted in our alternative budget, profits over the last ten years have gone up by 294%, but people on social welfare and pension payments are still going to be worse off than they were in 2020. It is absolutely disgraceful. In our alternative budget, we proposed to raise everybody on a social welfare or pension payment above the poverty level. We have about 700,000 to 800,000 people living in, around or below the poverty level and we proposed bringing all of them above that poverty level by having a minimum payment of €300 and a cost-of-disability payment of an additional €50 to cover the enormous cost of disability. The Government had the resources to do it, but it refused to do it because it is interested in looking after the superwealthy rather than eliminating poverty when it does have the resources available.",
                "I know the Minister of State is shaking her head. I suspect, you see, that people do not even know just the extent of the tax expenditures and tax write-offs that go to the giant multinational corporations because we do not discuss them. I still do not see those figures. I do not know if we are going to see them over the next day or two. I certainly did not see them in the budget package. I refer to the tax expenditures and the shadow budget of tax reliefs, most of which go to the big corporations. Where is the list detailing them and how much is going to them next year? We know. We go to the bother of bringing these tax expenditures and write-offs up at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight and detailing some of them in our alternative budget and they are quite staggering.",
                "The figures are always a year or two behind but they are quite staggering. In 2022, for example, capital allowances to the big corporations amounted to €101 billion, while intergroup transactions amounted to €4 billion in tax expenditures. Losses, including capital allowances brought forward, where these big wealthy corporations get to write-off taxes based on previous losses, amounted to €16 billion. The research and development tax credit, that goes overwhelmingly to the big corporations, amounted to €1.1 billion. I will not go through the entire list, but these sums are enormous and they bring down the taxable profits of the big corporations by tens and tens of billions of euro. This means that these corporations, in reality, pay not the 12.5% they are supposed to pay but about 7%. As we know from Apple, some of them are paying considerably less. The Government did not even want to take that money off them. It fought not to take that money off them. Now that we have that money, virtually nothing additional is being done with it. It has gone into the Future Ireland Fund and the infrastructural fund to be done we do not know what with.",
                "Regarding the money that has been mentioned, the €3 billion, it is not at all clear what is going to be done with it. Some €1 billion is going to the LDA and some extra money is also going into energy, etc. What, though, is this money actually going to be spent on? When we consider the slowness of the LDA in delivering social and affordable housing and the cost at which it is delivering it, it is debatable if it is going to increase in any significant way the delivery or affordability of the social and affordable housing it is supposed to deliver.",
                "For workers, there is an extra 80 cent for those on the minimum wage. I was looking at the Ministers' budget book and those on €25,000 are going to get about €1,400 extra this year, mostly because of the small increase in the minimum wage. Their tax liability, however, will be slightly more than it was last year, which is interesting. The tax changes brought in by the Government, therefore, have favoured the higher income earners. Let us contrast this €1,400, which, again, will not even keep pace, in reality, with inflation and the cost-of-living hikes, with another figure. According to the budget book, people on €127,000, or €125,000, which I think this was one of the examples, while another example concerned people on €114,000, are going to gain more from the taxation changes in the budget than someone on the minimum wage. It is disgraceful. There is no real effort to address the problem of the working poor in this country, who are the lowest paid workers. The people at the top of the income distribution are going to do considerably better.",
                "I also wish to mention higher education, and all we are getting in this area. People need to think about this aspect. One of the biggest problems we have along with the housing crisis, although it is significantly connected to it, is skills shortages. For the life of me, I cannot understand why it is being addressed this way in the budget when we need to get tens of thousands more people qualified in a whole range of areas, including the construction trades professions, the healthcare professions and teaching. We could go through the list and include examples in almost every area, including the caring professions. We need more people qualified, but instead of using all this money to eliminate the financial obstacles and barriers to people getting qualified, we have done virtually nothing. It is absolutely miserable. The Government has maintained a once-off €1,000 cut in the registration fee and a once-off 33% reduction in the apprentice contribution. There is also some vague mention of action on postgraduate stipends, although it is not clear what this actually is.",
                "With all the resources available to the Government, it is obvious to me that it would have abolished all fees that are financial obstacles to people getting qualified in higher and further education, in the trades and professions, and so on, where we need to get people qualified. There should also be substantial additional money for student accommodation, not just to provide more of it but to make it genuinely affordable, which it is not currently. Even when on-campus accommodation is built, it is offered at completely unaffordable rents for many, many students. We need, therefore, genuinely free higher and further education.",
                "The Government has done nothing, despite all of the resources at its disposal, to genuinely increase access, create more places and remove the financial barriers and obstacles to people getting qualified in these areas.",
                "In arts, culture and sports, there have been some minor increases but they just about keep pace with inflation. There was a 6% increase in total in arts, culture and sports, with only 3% of an increase in the arts and culture area, which represents just about standing still. There is no significant real increase in the money available and it is certainly not going to address the problem of widespread precarity and poverty among the vast majority of people engaged in the arts, music and performance in this country. We propose, for example, that everybody who applied for the basic income for artists should get it. All the Government is proposing to do is extend the pilot scheme by a few months, which sees money being given to only a fraction of the artists, performers and people who work in the arts who applied in the first place for that support. Again, the Government has the resources to do it. It could also, as we suggested, impose taxes on the social media and big IT companies to fund the arts, culture, and public service broadcasting in a way that would provide security and decent incomes for people who work in the arts. I could go on but my time is up.",
                "This budget is just more of the same from the Government. It is more of the same as it continues the big tax reliefs and tax credits for large corporations, protects the interests of the super rich and does nothing to redistribute the unprecedented wealth and profits that are being made in this country to eliminate poverty, to give working people a decent break in respect of the cost of living, to deliver social and affordable housing, decent health services and other public services that people in this country need and deserve."

He did not mention, nor did the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, that, as Deputy Boyd Barrett has pointed out, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael fought tooth and nail not to take this transformative amount of money, to say that €14 billion should stay on the cash pile of one of the biggest, richest corporations in the world. He also did not mention that they wasted €10 million of public money in fighting that case. People will remember what happened around the Apple tax. It will be a focal point of the coming general election campaign because it epitomises the reality of politics and the class nature of the society we live in where, in the words of James Connolly, governments are committees of the rich to manage the affairs of the capitalist class. The truth is that this Government puts the profits of big corporations like Apple, of big developers and of big corporate landlords before the needs of ordinary people. That is the essence of the sort of Government we have.",
                "In any case, against its own wishes, we now have the money. I actually agree with Deputy Chambers that it has the capacity to be transformational but is anyone in the Government actually making the case that this is a transformational budget? Where are the transformational changes in this budget? There is nothing that can be trumpeted as transformational. There are a few once-off payments and a few tax breaks, which I will get to presently, but where is the State construction company in the context of an unprecedented housing crisis with record house prices and rents and record levels of homelessness? Where is the public childcare? Where is the public provision of childcare, free at the point of access, in the context of families spending an extra mortgage every month for one child and an extra two mortgages a month for two children? Where is the investment in public transport, renewable energy and retrofitting in the context of the climate catastrophe that we are heading towards? There is no mention of the building of a national health service and no provision for a special class in every school across the country. There is nothing in this budget that can be pointed at as being transformational. In fact, it is the opposite of a transformational budget. It is a series of once-off, sometimes twice-off measures for ordinary people in social welfare and child benefit. There is a reduction in student fees but even the reduction in public transport fees is continued on a once-off basis.",
                "It is the biggest scam ever, this once-off business where the Government comes in, year after year, and announces the same measures that it announced the previous year and expects to get some applause for it. This is all a very obvious ploy to try to continue the 100-year rule of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. We have once-off measures for ordinary people but permanent tax breaks for the wealthy of various sorts. We have an extension of the angel investor relief. I am sure millions of people across the country are breathing a sigh of relief that their angel investments will attract tax relief. There are extra incentives like the employment investment incentive, start-up relief for entrepreneurs, a start-up capital incentive, a series of extensions to capital gains tax relief and a new extension of relief for incorporated farms, which are agribusinesses. Fine Gael just put out a tweet with which I agree. The tweet contains a graphic that says \"Fine Gael is backing business\". One of the headline points the party is highlighting to show how it is backing business, proudly, is \"no increase in sick leave days\" and in brackets, \"which were due to double in January\". In what world is it a bad thing to increase sick day leave, in terms of public health or workers' rights? Fine Gael thinks it is a bad thing to do something that was promised. When the Government originally introduced the sick pay legislation, we pointed out that it was not baked into the legislation that the number of days would increase in the way the Government was saying they would. The Minister said that there was no need to worry about that because it would be done by ministerial order. Now, precisely as we warned, the Government is not doing it. Why? It is because Fine Gael is backing business."

If anything demonstrates that this budget is an attempt to buy the election, it is the Government's treatment of young people. The Government is not attempting to buy young people but is attempting to drive them out of the country. There is almost nothing in this budget for young people because the Government has given up on attracting their votes. Its best hope is to simply drive them out. Let us take the issue of jobseeker's allowance for young people. One of the horrific measures introduced in the context of the financial crash was to separate out and create a new rate for people under 25, effectively cutting the dole for young people and 16 years later, this discrimination against young people continues. In the context of a massive budget surplus, the Government is continuing with this discrimination, leaving some young people, increasingly driven to live at home because of the housing crisis, on €141.70 per week. Then there is the issue of so-called sub-minimum wage rates. Passed by this Dáil well over a year ago, then delayed by a year, was a Bill that we introduced to get rid of these exploitative rates allowing people to be paid less than the minimum wage. The Low Pay Commission unanimously recommended the ending of these sub-minimum wage rates but there is nothing on this in the budget. The Government is going to continue with these sub-minimum wage rates, allowing the legal super-exploitation of thousands of young workers who can be paid as little as €9.45 per hour."

                "My God, what could have been done with this budget when we look at the wealth in this country. Oxfam has advised that 1% now own 35% of financial wealth and 10% own 54% of total household net wealth. Profits trebled in the last ten years. Corporations might have made more than €300 billion profits after tax last year. If we had a government that was prepared to use the State surplus along with the Apple tax and go after some of this wealth, we would have a government that could transform Irish society. A free national health service, a free State-provided childcare service and free public transport would be within reach. Instead we have a government with no vision introducing a one-for-everybody-in-the-audience budget in an attempt to buy an election and a government which is determined to defend the interests of the rich and powerful at every hand's turn.",
                "This could have and should have been a landmark budget but it is not because of this Government's slavish adherence to free market ideology, trying to find market solutions where market solutions have failed before. The Government's free market obsession can be viewed right across the spectrum of government, from bike sheds to bungalows.",
                "Let us take the issue of housing. The market is not delivering nearly enough houses. In particular the market is not delivering nearly enough affordable homes. Here was an opportunity to set up a State construction company with a laser-like focus on building not-for-profit social and affordable housing. The usual mantra that the money was not there would not cut it. The Apple billions gave the opportunity to provide the seed capital for such a company. This Government, facing a giant open goal with the ball at its feet, blew it. We have no State construction company, no seed capital, no not-for-profit social and affordable housing and not even an increase in the State's housing targets, which is quite incredible. We have the same old same old, only more of it, throwing money at developers and landlords. It is clear the housing crisis will not be tackled in the way it needs to be tackled by this Government. A new government can only tackle it by changing the policy and ending the reliance on these market-based solutions.",
                "Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael may well believe that ship of government is sailing into calm untroubled waters after this budget, but there are rocks up ahead and the budget does not seem to be steering away from them. One of these rocks is the HSE's pay and numbers strategy. During the summer, the Government announced an end to the recruitment freeze in our health service but then it replaced it with a recruitment freeze by another name. The Minister's pay and numbers strategy is causing distress and anger right across the workforce in the HSE. Some 88% of Fórsa members polled report staff vacancies in their own departments. Health service unions say the caps Government has imposed will leave at least 2,000 vacancies unfilled. The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation is balloting for industrial action on this issue in just 13 days' time. This Thursday I will join INMO, Fórsa and SIPTU members at a lunchtime protest at the gates of Cork University Hospital. This is an early warning for the Minister that he sails on with that one at his peril.",
                "While I am on the health service, I have two other brief points. There is a €3 billion increase, but €1.5 billion of that makes up the shortfall from last year and a further €1.2 million is just to maintain existing services. There is very little for new measures there. I think it might be heading for some difficulties over the winter with that.",
                "In November 2022 Transgender Europe ranked Ireland 27th out of 27 EU countries for trans healthcare. It reported that a trans person in Ireland might wait up to ten years just for an appointment with a specialist. This is not acceptable nor is the outdated approach at the national gender service. We need a significant increase in funding for trans healthcare and a switch to a new GP-led informed consent model.",
                "In 2021 the Department of Social Protection commissioned a report from Indecon on the cost of disability in Ireland. The report found that disabled people had to cover special costs averaging between €8,700 and €12,300 per year - the cost of medicines, the cost of care, the cost of extra heating and the cost of taxis and travel. This budget is proof if proof were needed that the Government does not see disabled people as equals. It increased disability payments by €12 a week and threw in a once-off payment of €400 - a combined total of a few bob over €1,000. That is a mere fraction of what disabled people need, even according to the report that the Government commissioned, if there is to be any semblance of equality for disabled people in our society. If the Government cannot take a giant stride towards income equality for people with disabilities when the State coffers are overflowing, disabled people will rightly draw the conclusion that the parties in this Government will never take the steps that disabled people need. We also need to see the abolition of the punitive means tax on disabled people who will not take charity any more. They will stand up for their rights and we will stand with them.",
                "The Minister announced extra funding for Uisce Éireann. People will want to see this money going to improve their water supply rather than to feed the fat cats at the top of this organisation. Last Thursday night I stood with residents of the Mount Farran estate in Blackpool on the northside of Cork city as they protested over the prevalence of brown and orange discoloured water flowing from their taps. These residents were outraged that Uisce Éireann now has 16 people on its payroll who were each paid more than €200,000 last year. They asked why there are such big bonuses for the people at the top when the ordinary householder has to put up with disgraceful discoloration. Many other communities in Cork and other parts of the country will be asking the same thing.",
                "There is an epidemic of gender-based violence in our society. Women's Aid received more than 40,000 disclosures of domestic abuse last year, the highest ever recorded in the charity's 50-year history. The Istanbul Convention signed by this State commits the State to one refuge space for every 10,000 of the population. To hit the Istanbul target there would need to be 512 spaces in this State. The total cost would be €1.27 billion to bridge from where we are to that. How much did the Government commit to organisations dealing with gender-based violence? An extra €7 million. To the Government's shame, with coffers overflowing these organisations will still be forced to go out and organise raffles and other fundraisers to provide the services that women need in 2025.",
                "On 20 October hundreds of services will be cut from five Cork city bus routes. Bus Éireann states it cannot recruit and retain the drivers needed to serve the routes. At the end of the day this is because of the wages and conditions of bus workers, which are inadequate. This issue should have been addressed in the budget. The people of Cork and those who rely on public transport throughout the State have been let down by the failure today to address this issue.",
                "The minimum wage is to increase to €13.50 an hour on 1 January, as recommended by the Low Pay Commission. It is a paltry pay increase when rents are sky high and the cost-of-living crisis still bears down on people and especially on the low paid. The Low Pay Commission also proposed that young people under the age of 20 should be entitled to the full minimum wage as and from 1 January. The Minister was silent on this matter in his speech. I ask the Minister to break his silence and to clarify the position. It would be outrageous if the Minister were to defy this recommendation and keep in place a wage structure that discriminates openly against young people. I ask for clarification please on this issue.",
                "If we had a government in the State that was prepared, in the interests of the very many, to go after the wealth that has been cornered by the very few, and couple it with the Apple tax money and the State surplus that is there, and if we had a government with a vision of a better society, better public services and better lives for ordinary people, we could have had a transformational budget. As I said at the outset, we could have a free national health service, free public transport and free State-provided childcare. These were within the grasp of a Government that had vision and that was prepared to take on the vested interests in society. Unfortunately it is clear that is not the Government which the Minister of State is representing in the House today."

                "I welcome the opportunity to speak on the budget announced today. A lot of money is being given out. There is a lot of detail that we have not seen yet. Something that came to my mind at the very start of this is that so much money is being flayed out all over the place, the most important thing will be how we are going to manage it. How are we going to make sure that money reaches where it is intended to go? With the social welfare payments, it will get to the people who need it but if we look at infrastructure and how we will spend the capital money, there are issues that need to be addressed as a matter of urgency.",
                "We have a procurement and public spending code that is not fit for purpose. It delays projects and adds more costs to them. We have a flawed national planning framework whereby we deny the zoning of land and, in turn, this denies young people a chance to build a house in their local town or village. This is because the local area plan must go with a core strategy.",
                "Last Sunday morning I was at a protest in Loughrea. Approximately 500 people came out at 10 a.m. in the rain because the Office of the Planning Regulator and the Minister want to dezone land that was zoned for recreational purposes. This is badly needed in Loughrea but we have a Government policy that says we cannot have it. We have to think about how we are spending money and how we are accountable for it. We have had plenty of examples in recent weeks of how things have got out of control entirely, probably because of the ego of an architect or an architectural design that creates large costs with taxpayers' money and no accountability.",
                "Something else the Government has to take into account leading into an election is that the Northern and Western Regional Assembly area is in decline. It is a lagging region. We should be positively discriminating in favour of the region in terms of investment. When I hear about all of the money being spent today I have concerns about the Galway city outer bypass. Where is that? Where is the western rail corridor? Where is Galway port? There is great news about Cork port but where is Galway port? What about all of the towns and villages in all of our counties that are devoid of wastewater treatment plants which means, in turn, housing cannot be built? I see that €1 billion has been allocated to Irish Water. When I look at what it is for I do not see a large amount of money being put in for the fast-track development of wastewater treatment plants.",
                "The budget has been neutral for farming. The concept that farmers have such volatility in their income at present is not being taken into account in the budget. There are announcements of millions for this and millions for something else. It is about how it is implemented and how quickly the money gets to the farmers' accounts. If they do not have certainty of when they will get their grants this will destroy their cash flow. It means that farmers are thinking about getting out of farming rather than being encouraged to get into it.",
                "I have a concern about the residential zoned land tax. It is important that we clarify this once and for all. It is more than 18 months since I first raised it with then Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, who stated then that there was a problem. We are still talking today about getting a resolution for it so that active farmers can continue to farm without having a fear that the land would be taxed. It should not be taxed, and people accept this, but there seems to be inertia with trying to get a plan in place to exempt functional farmers.",
                "I am a member of the Committee on Disability Matters and I am concerned about carers and children who have disabilities waiting for services. They are waiting to get assessments. With regard to the CDNT unit in Tuam, this time last year parents were protesting because of the lack of services. Money is being put into taking on more staff but money was put into this last year and staff were not taken on, for whatever reason. I know of people who have emigrated because the HSE would not give them a permanent position. It is important that we do not just throw money at a problem. We have to have an effective way of getting people to work in our health system. The only way we can do this is by making it attractive and giving people permanent jobs and putting in enough people to take some of the stress out of the job.",
                "The review of the housing adaptation grant and the housing aid for older people has been going on for a hell of a long time. Today money has been announced for these grants, which are administered and which help people with disabilities and keep people in their homes longer. I do not see the detail of whether there is an increase in funding to allow a bigger grant to be given or whether there is an increase in the income threshold for people so they can get the highest possible percentage grant from the local authorities. They are fantastic grants but because of construction inflation we need to make sure the money matches what is relevant in today's world and look at the income thresholds.",
                "Another issue I have raised with the Minister is with regard to the primary medical certificate. It is a Department of Finance issue. The primary medical certificate is not fit for purpose. The criteria are too strict and everybody knows this. The Minister has been reviewing it for a long time. Now is the time to put in place proper primary medical certificate criteria in order that people who need help to become a bit more independent and adapt their cars can get the certificate.",
                "I welcome the baby boost of €420 but what about the babies who will be born in October, November and December? Why will this grant not be given to babies born from now on, seeing that it has been announced? It is unfair to leave babies and families out of it just because we pick a certain date.",

                "This budget was framed as a budget for families and alleviating the cost of living. While there are aspects that are welcome, the measures barely scratch the surface of what is required to help ordinary families. We cannot celebrate economic growth when many are left behind.",
                "First, I will touch on housing. The Government has acknowledged the housing crisis, but its proposed measures are inadequate to address the challenges. Rents rising by 27%, record homelessness and an increasing housing list reflect the failure to provide affordable options. Recent figures show that 14,486 people, including 4,417 children, live in emergency accommodation.",
                "Record house prices, record rents and promises of increased housing supply have not translated into urgent actions. The Housing for All plan has proven ineffective and the ongoing housing crisis continues to leave more families struggling to find a home. Although the Government increased the rent tax credit, the budget failed to increase the housing targets to address the rental property shortage, leaving renters with fewer options and unaffordable rents. The Housing for All plan is overly reliant on the private market and vulture funds, with no measures to curb this. A thorough plan is necessary to tackle the affordability crisis, which should include funding for public housing, rent regulation and enhanced tenant protections. Without initiatives like rent freezes and preventing landlords profiteering, housing will continue to be unaffordable. Ultimately, home ownership has collapsed. The average age of ownership is 39. This budget lacks a clear strategy for expanding the rental stock, exacerbating the crisis and affecting students, young professionals and families. Young people are either living in their childhood home or emigrating.",
                "Second, I would like to discuss health and mental health. When we look at the healthcare allocations in this budget, it is clear that the Government is once again focused on firefighting rather than structural reform. No-one would argue against better resources, but we cannot continue to pour money into a broken system without reforming the way it works. Our health service is under immense strain with record waiting times, overwhelmed emergency departments and critical shortages of staff. To fix this, we need a complete overhaul of how we deliver healthcare. We must move towards a universal, single-tier healthcare system where access to care is based on need, not the ability to pay. This budget should have committed to a bold plan to make healthcare free at the point of use, as promised under the long-delayed Sláintecare plan. Instead, we see piecemeal funding increases that will not address the root causes of the crisis in our health system. Waiting lists are symptoms of deeper structural issues, poor resource management and a lack of co-ordinated care between hospitals and community services. This budget needed to focus on a strategy to streamline services, improve management practices and ensure that patients receive timely, quality care. We also need to address the chronic shortages in healthcare professionals by providing better pay, conditions and opportunities for training and development to attract and retain staff. In my constituency of Louth and east Meath, there is a lack of GPs, orthodontists, neurologists and psychologists. Community healthcare organisation, CHO, 8 is one of only two CHOs in the country that has not received funding for a community neurorehabilitation team. This list goes on.",
                "Furthermore, mental health services are overstretched and underfunded, with long waiting lists and inadequate support for young people. I will acknowledge the progress made with reforms to the Mental Health Act. Passing laws is not enough, however. We need action, implementation and resources. What percentage of the health budget will go to mental health? Is it likely to remain stagnant at 5% to 6%? We need ring-fenced funding for mental health to ensure it does not get swallowed up by other competing priorities and ensure full alignment with the goals set out in the Mental Health Act. That means increasing investment in mental health infrastructure and training and ensuring that services are accessible, particularly in rural Ireland. Additionally, we must prioritise early intervention programmes and community-based mental health services, which can prevent issues from escalating into crises.",
                "At this point, I would like to touch on carers and people with a disability. The €12 per week increase in all social welfare rates in the new year, an increase in the carer's support grant to €2,000, a €200 living alone lump sum and a range of cost-of-living payments for carers and pensioners between now and Christmas are welcome. However, these once-off payments do not come close to covering the additional costs carers absorb, such as medical equipment, home adaptations and transportation. Carers save the State billions of euro each year. The means test overlooks the emotional, physical and financial burdens of caregiving. The Regional Group motion last week called upon the Government to implement the unanimous recommendation of the joint Oireachtas committee on social protection to set a roadmap for a non-means tested participation income for family carers by 2027. While I will acknowledge the increase in the means income disregard, one of the greatest oversights in this budget is the lack of meaningful reform to the carer’s allowance means test as it is gender-biased and no longer fit for purpose. The abolition of the means test and its replacement with a participation income based on the valuable work family carers make in our society would have been welcome for thousands of carers, lifting them out of poverty and provided essential support.",
                "Similarly, the Government has failed to provide sufficient support for people with disabilities, which the Regional Group highlighted in our pre-budget meeting. Although there are small increases in disability allowances, this falls far short of covering the additional €9,000 to €12,000 per year incurred by a disabled person. There is still no comprehensive national strategy to address accessibility, independence and the provision of adequate services for those living with disabilities.",
                "Finally, the budget's minor business supports, and the unchanged 13.5% VAT rate are Government failures, risking closure for many food-led businesses. It falls short of what is required to ensure our SMEs remain competitive and viable in an increasingly challenging economic landscape. What this budget needed was a targeted package of supports for SMEs, incorporating tax reliefs with access to low-interest loans and grants to help them transition to more sustainable and digital operations. We should have empowered SMEs with the tools they need to innovate, grow and create jobs rather than leaving them vulnerable to further economic shocks.",
                "To conclude, I recognise and welcome the measures introduced by the Government today, which will offer short-term benefits. However, I urge greater reform and investment across the various sectors instead of once-off splurges to ensure basic rights and reduce poverty in the long term. Everything I said is what is actually happening on the ground."

There is no doubt that it will be short-lived, however, because now that I am experiencing my fifth budget, I know that most of what has been announced will not be delivered. That comes from experience. I have learned that quite often delivery never happens. Coming from County Wexford, we have had no extension of the N11, a 33 km stretch that is ultimately a car park at certain times of the day depending on the boat traffic for the growing port of Rosslare Harbour. We do not have the 97-bed hospital unit we were promised. I have been elected for five years and we are no further along. As I said, much of what the Government announces never gets delivered.",
                "I will come back to that, however, because I want to discuss some of the items or issues the Government has chosen not to deal with. The sorry fact is that when I was preparing my speech, I could actually have read last year's speech, and it would still be very relevant. As a Government, it has not changed, and it is not going to change because it does not listen. We face the same problems year in, year out. There is no doubt that some will benefit in the short term from the budget, but blind men on galloping horses can see the Government is just buying votes. It has failed to see the bigger picture. Government should not be frittering away the taxpayers' money. That is not the way a responsible government carries on, yet there is no end to the waste. The bigger picture is that the Government got lucky with the receipts for foreign direct investment, FDI. We are lucky that we are in a surplus scenario because with the lack of investment in infrastructure, we could well be in a deficit. That could all change with the election in November in America. I caution the Minister of State to think about this. We could be in a very serious deficit this time next year because the Government has not chosen to plan the infrastructure of either water or electricity, as is required by the FDI tech sector, the money from which we are now spending.",
                "In effect, the Government is killing off the goose that is laying the golden egg. Some €38 billion in Amazon investment has gone elsewhere because of our policies, our lack of infrastructure planning and our planning policy. This is a travesty and puts us in jeopardy.",
                "The Government has failed to recognise that a 9% VAT rate could have had zero tax implications for the State. It could have been done simply by joining the dots. There is a specific issue at Dublin Airport, which is subject to a passenger cap due to a traffic management planning process under a regulation that was introduced in 2007. We have failed to deal with the issue in the 17 years since. We built a second runway to increase our ability to take traffic at Dublin Airport, but the fact that we have capped tourist numbers means that we will be €500 million down this time next year. Had we dealt with the issue, the €500 million flowing from an increase in tourist numbers could have offset the €500 million lost through the reduction in VAT to 9% for the tourism sector. For the 300,000 people involved in the sector, not reducing the rate means that more restaurants and cafes will close. Many of them are in rural Ireland, where the hospitality sector has lost beds in recent years due to the Ukrainian war and the refugee crisis, which came on top of the housing crisis. We no longer have bed nights in rural areas, so the cafes and restaurants that depend on tourists are not seeing their footfall. The cost of living also means that locals are not out spending like they used to. Not reducing VAT is a missed opportunity. The tourism sector will effectively suffer a deficit of €1 billion because the Government is unable to join the dots.",
                "I do not know whether anyone has ever considered that Michael O'Leary of Ryanair has probably done more for this country than many of our foreign direct investors. This is not to praise Michael O'Leary. I do not know him and have never met him. I just know that he opened Ireland up to the world and the world up to Ireland. It is a travesty that we do not listen to people who know what they are talking about. That the Minister is being a bit of a big girl’s blouse about this and that the Taoiseach will not take command of the matter is not helping. I suggest that the Minister of State take the message back to the Government that if we are to continue growing Ireland and we have the sense not to ruin the tourism sector, someone should take action about the cap at Dublin Airport.",
                "The same applies to housing, where the Government has not listened to the developers or builders. It is as if they are pariahs. The Government is out of ideas, though. My proposal of a 0% VAT rate for new builds would instigate the commencement of the 50,000 planning applications that have not yet been commenced because they are not viable. The Government’s tax take on new house builds is 48%, but we are telling people that housing will be affordable. All we are doing now is building social housing, as no one else can afford to buy a house at the cost base the Government has set. Take 30.5% away. If the Government does not recognise the viability issue and reduce its tax take, we will never see those houses built. The Government has to know what the problem is if it is going to solve it.",
                "I am out of time, although I do not know if any amount of time would let me get through the exponential growth in waste overseen by this Government, from the children’s hospital to the modular builds. As we saw yesterday, those modular builds cost double their estimate. This is a serious issue. What of the bike shelter that is not really a bike shelter? At €336,000, it is a national disgrace. Add to that the cost of a security hut and we have flittered away approximately €2 million of taxpayers’ money, yet this is only the tip of the iceberg. I could go on and on. I ask the Minister of State to take the message to the Government that this is a serious issue and that we need to eradicate the waste, as we may one day not have the foreign direct investment that the Government is enjoying at the moment.",
                "We have to consider the SME sector. Some 1.2 million of our employees work therein, yet I can see nothing in this budget to assist SMEs. They have to undergo the increase in the minimum wage. That increase is necessary, given that we as normal people cannot afford the cost of living, but many of the measures the Government has introduced are inflationary and will drive up the cost of living. The carbon tax on fuel is being increased. As the Minister of State knows, anything that affects transport drives up the cost of everything else.",
                "It is time that the Government stopped thinking about the parties in government and what is politically expedient for them and started thinking more about expenditure for the people who elect them and their future in Ireland."

                "I welcome the opportunity to comment on the budget. Overall, I welcome its thrust. It is not perfect, but it represents progress in some areas. I will focus on three particular sectors that are rarely mentioned in the Chamber anymore: defence, agriculture and the shared island programme.",
                "I welcome the increase in defence expenditure. An extra €100 million represents an 8% increase, making for the largest defence budget in my lifetime of €1.35 billion. This is positive. It is neither adequate nor sufficient, but it is a half-step in the right direction. More important is how the €1.35 billion is going to be spent. We can throw around headline figures all we want, but this is where the focus should be.",
                "I wish to express my gratitude to everyone on the Government and Opposition benches and at home who has been involved in this work for the past number of years. Worthwhile and dignified advocacy down the years has led to some progress, particularly from a pay perspective. As of today, a new private, three star, of 18 years of age or whatever age can start at €40,000. This is a psychologically important level to focus on and represents an increase of more than 50% on the €27,500 level it was at at the start of this Dáil. The patrol duty offshore allowance for the Naval Service was doubled nine months ago. There has also been progress in respect of the naval personnel tax credit and the ARW allowance. However, our military personnel are still the lowest paid public servants, so there is still much more work to be done. We need to focus on long service increments, the European working time directive and, in particular, overtime payments. Every other uniformed service gets overtime payments for rostered duty hours. It should be no different for a peacetime military.",
                "Regarding premises, I acknowledge that there has been progress on buildings nationally, particularly at the Curragh Camp in my constituency. There is a new cadet school, new headquarters, a new engineering building and a new transport building. Work on a new communications building is also ongoing. There are two other buildings – one in Dublin and the other in the Curragh – I am not supposed to mention, but €35 million is being spent on them. However, more progress is needed. As the Ceann Comhairle will be aware, more than 60 family homes at the Curragh Camp are either vacant or derelict. This is unacceptable and unnecessary, particularly given the housing crisis. There should be a crèche in the Curragh, on the naval base in Haulbowline and at Baldonnel. If we want more women to join the Defence Forces, we must address these logistical issues. People will then join. Something else that is desperately needed is an east coast naval base in Dún Laoghaire, particularly given what is happening in the Irish Sea and given our critical national infrastructure, including the gas pipelines and electricity interconnector. The terminal is there, but it is almost vacant. We should take full advantage of it.",
                "The money being provided needs to be spent on sonar and radar. In recent weeks, the Dáil has discussed aircraft travelling through Irish airspace without us knowing about them or what they were carrying. It took journalists rather than the State to point them out and that is not good enough.",
                "Most metrics in the defence sector are going in the right direction now, bar people. The head count is still dropping, with the possible exception of the Naval Service. We heard approximately three weeks ago that the navy expects that there will be slightly more sailors at the end of this year than there were at the start, which is an important piece of information. For the first year in a decade, there will be a net increase in naval sailors. That is a positive development. The bottom line is, if pay rates are increased to normal rates, there will be a positive spin-off as well.",
                "The Reserve Defence Force will be rejuvenated. The sooner that happens, the better. It is the natural conveyor belt of people into the regulars. The sooner we get that programme up and running, the better off we will all be.",
                "The second sector I want to talk about is agriculture. It is hugely important, as I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Colm Burke, knows from his own county of Cork. Generally, it is the poor relation. It does not have the same clout that it had in the past in this Chamber but it should because farms are the original SMEs. They are the lifeblood of rural Ireland and communities as well. I recognise and acknowledge the increase of approximately €150 million to in excess of €2 billion in the agricultural budget for 2025. That is positive. In particular, I welcome the tillage support scheme, which is important for counties Kildare, Kilkenny, Carlow and all the east coast, and the beef and sheep welfare schemes as well. I welcome the additional funding being put onstream to assist farmers in meeting their important climate change targets relating to biodiversity, water and air quality.",
                "The Minister of State knows how hard it has been for farmers over the past two years. One bad year is bad enough, but to have two years back to back is almost a crisis. What we need is that the payments that farmers expect to arrive on time. They should be regular, they should be recurring and they should be absolutely reliable. What has happened over the past couple of years, where there have been delays in TAMS and ACRES payments, is simply not good enough.",
                "Finally, I will focus on the shared island programme. There are some very worthwhile projects here, particularly the Warrenpoint bridge. However, one project that rarely gets a mention is the Mitchell scholars programme. The Taoiseach is visiting the White House in the next couple of weeks and I would like him to raise it with President Biden. The programme, founded by Trina Vargo and named after Senator George Mitchell, is a hugely important link between this country and America. They need €32 million as an endowment to keep this programme up and running. Currently, it is in abeyance. We can provide this funding because the links between this country and North America are important.",
                "In summary, I welcome the general thrust of the budget but there is a huge amount of work to do. It is not perfect in any shape or form, but it is progress. I recognise that limited progress has occurred."

The measures announced offer a reprieve from the merciless grip of inflation, rising prices and the diminishing purchasing power facing families. For these many reasons, and the temporary relief it offers, I feel compelled to support it.",
                "People need this relief, but let us not mistake the genesis of these giveaways. They are because principally these concessions have been bought with the people's own money and I would not want to bet on the fulsome gratitude of the electorate in the near future. It is their own hard-earned cash after all.",
                "Indeed, if we fall into the trap of thinking that these windfall gains will last indefinitely, as IFAC believe the Government has, we may have the serious vibes of 1977, 2001 or 2007 all over again - an election bought with our money. I hope the Ministers and Government know what they are doing.",
                "Let us be clear. The Government’s hand has been forced by the crushing burden of the cost-of-living crisis. Previous budgets have added to this inflation. Wages are not rising enough to keep pace with the relentless march of price rises yet increased wage costs are seriously constraining the viability of the small-to-medium business sector and the agri-sector. Housing costs are soaring, energy prices are still punishing the commercial sector and families are cutting back on necessities like never before.",
                "Businesses, particularly those in farming and hospitality. are hurting and some are going to the wall. The budget throws out lifelines, but I am disappointed that the key SME sector appears to have received little to offset its costs crisis. I would also like to have seen something in this budget that offered reform to our dysfunctional public procurement system.",
                "Unprecedented though this budget giveaway undoubtedly is, it falls short of real ambition for Ireland's future in three critical ways. First, it does nothing to address the competitiveness and productivity problems in the economy. The runaway multinational sector is hiding the growing problems in our indigenous business sector. FDI tax has become the new budgetary scaffold allowing us to defy economic gravity. Where is the visionary policy and investment to unleash our indigenous enterprise sector? Where is the grand policy plan needed to empower our private sector to create new businesses, to invest, to collaborate, to innovate with universities, to compete and, most important, to scale? I do not see such initiatives in the budget measures announced. Second, this scattergun approach to spending will almost certainly fail to deliver value for money. We have become more than aware in recent weeks what a train wreck the value proposition has become in public procurement. It is not enough to throw money at problems; we must throw intelligence, strategy, planning and management expertise at them too, but when we look at the bike shed, the security hut, and the national children's hospital, the public at large has good reason not to have confidence in the State to deliver value on any measure. The budget should offer better disclosures on where the funding goes, and better oversight, better scrutiny, better management and better outcomes. We still await transparency in respect all of that. Finally, this budget appears to be the last in a series that patches the cracks without ever addressing the foundations of our economic and social system. There is no vision developed here or a cohesive long-term plan offering the long-term growth or equitable development we need to secure our economic future.",
                "The south-east, my region, like the Border and north west, is now experiencing economic contraction, a drop in regional GDP and a sharp rise in unemployment - all on top of the cost of living crisis. As this Administration draws its last breath, let me ask this of Government. Where is the 24-7 cardiac care that the people of the south east have been demanding for years? It was promised in 2016. Where is the sustained investment in higher education for the region? Less than 6% of the capital investment identified in the South East Technological University's strategic plan has been promised by the Government, let alone delivered. We need to end the regional brain drain that sees two thirds of young people who go to college and migrate out of the region. Without investing in higher education, the region will still lag behind in FDI. It will still miss its ration of this boom and perhaps the next boom too. What of Waterford Airport, a vital gateway and economic driver for the region supporting tourism and enterprise development? Everyone in Waterford and the south east witnessed the Government spend €484 million of public money on other airports, yet it bickers over approving €12 million in matching funding for Waterford.",
                "When regions are starved of investment and when their potential is ignored, they begin to pull away. They begin to question their value to a State that seems indifferent to their needs. This is not just the basis for an economic issue; it also questions democratic values. The people of this country want fairness and a certain toughness on their behalf. They want and expect leadership that is more than just bouncing from one crisis to another. They want to hear a vision for a better future. They want that vision to include them.",
                "Sadly, this budget, like previous others, offers little to national long-term strategic development. It appears more of an effort to buy off the electorate while responding to events. Like some of my Independent colleagues, I will support this budget, but with these reservations. We should use this election campaign to start of a real conversation about the kind of country and the kind of future we want to build, one where no region or its people is left behind and one where, instead of planning for the next election cycle, we begin an inclusive, national, conversation to deliver, not just for today but for the generations of tomorrow."

These once-off payments will disappear like snow off a ditch, and they will not get to the heart of what is happening with poverty.",
                "It is important to realise that the people of Ireland are not stupid. They can see the difference between promises and delivery. I will give a couple of examples. The Government has decreased the middle rate of USC, instead of spreading that decrease over the lower rate and middle rate. This means a person on €100,000 will now pocket significantly more than a person earning €50,000. The electricity credits the Government has promised will be completely eroded by the PSO increases and the carbon tax increase. These once-off payments are like sticking plasters for major problems within society. Nothing is being done about the fact that the electricity prices in this country are the highest in Europe. The electricity credits will not help that in the long run. The Government is giving money with one hand and taking with the other. Last year, the amount of money the Government got from fuel taxes was the biggest in the history of the State. The Government pocketed €3.8 billion in fuel taxes in the heart of a cost-of-living crisis. Today, we will see an increase in petrol and diesel again on the same day we see the price of oil spike as a result of the war in the Middle East.",
                "The Government is trumpeting the fact that there will be bigger investment in childcare, yet childcare providers around the country are closing down on a weekly basis. Parents have to book their children into a childcare centre when their child is born. I agree wholeheartedly with the increase in child benefit for newborn babies. Aontú called for that to be given at the fourth month of pregnancy because parents need that money before the baby is born rather than afterwards.",
                "The elephant in the room in this regard is the shocking level of Government waste. The backdrop to this whole budget has been the children's hospital, the €300 million spent on metro north and not a shovel put in the ground and the 110 electric buses that did not move an inch and a half for a year and a half because there was nobody to apply for the charging units. There is the €20 million spent on ventilators during Covid that never worked. In recent times, we have heard of the \"Gucci\" bike shed and yesterday we had the \"Tiffany\" modular homes. We have a Government that has managed to spend more on a 45 sq. m modular home in County Laois than it costs to build a house of twice that size in the middle of Dublin. The level of Government waste is excruciating. There is a bonfire of taxpayer money and none of that has been addressed in this budget. That is a major problem. The motto of this Government is \"You will get less for more.\" The Government will provide less infrastructure for more money into the future.",
                "In terms of the targets we see in the budget, it is very hard to take this Government seriously. It has a bit of the feel of Del Boy saying we will all be millionaires next year. The Government comes up with these targets every year for new house builds, especially social housing, and it never meets them. Last year, the Government was out by 2,500 as regards the number of social houses to be built. At the same time, we are spending €1.6 billion on RAS and HAP payments and washing it down the drain. We are getting nothing for that investment which is disappearing every single year.",
                "On regional development, Ireland is becoming a city state. We have people commuting from Connacht, Ulster and Munster into Dublin every day at massive economic, environmental and emotional cost for their families because they are away from them for so long. Yet, we see nothing about the rebalancing of Ireland in this budget. There is no plan for a Navan to Dublin rail line. There is no plan to bring forward the western rail corridor. There is no plan to open an accident and emergency department in the mid-west to deal with the crisis there. We had a promise of flood defences in Midleton, County Cork, in 2017 and there is not even a planning application ready to go in yet to get those flood defences built. When it comes to investment for IPAS residents, the majority of locations - 87% - in which they are housed are in the hospitality sector. A full one third of hotels outside of Dublin are now taken up with contracts with the State. There is nothing to deal with that. There is no talk about consultation and engagement with communities. The authoritarian approach by the Minister continues. The hospitality sector is on its knees, and we see pubs and restaurants close weekly. There is no talk of a VAT reduction to 9% for that sector.",
                "One of the major problems I find with this Government is that it does not do reform, so the HSE is in major trouble regarding overspend and waste. The HSE spent €2.5 billion on compensation in the past ten years. The number of adverse incidents in the HSE is significantly increasing, which is leading to damage done to patients and high levels of compensation. However, the reason that damage is being done in the HSE is that there are too few doctors and nurses because we are in an international recruitment market and people are being paid better in Australia and Canada. The Australian Government, incredibly, is recruiting more gardaí at the moment than the Irish Government. We need to make sure that in these budgets we provide proper pay, terms and conditions for doctors, nurses and gardaí so they can live in their local communities.",
                "The other issue I want to discuss is capacity. We need to create capacity with regard to doctors, nurses and construction workers. The way to do that is workplace planning, but that means investing in our university sector. It is incredible that right now more than 50% of the students in our medical schools are from outside the EU. The reason is that the medical schools are dependent on the high fees these students pay to keep them going. When these students finish their degrees most of them head home and we have a major problem with doctors working in our health sector as a result. We must make sure we invest properly in the university sector to get the doctors and nurses we need and to deal with falling GP numbers throughout Ireland."

How come other European countries can have it? It is an abject failure. Companies are under pressure with energy costs and the increase in the minimum wage will put more cost on them. There is also sick pay, new insurance measures and the mandatory pension scheme that is coming in this year. The Government is oblivious to the troubles of these companies.",

Hauliers move every product we produce through the country and abroad and they got sweet you-know-what. It is so unfair.",

It is a bit insensitive when so many businesses are struggling to keep the power on. Whoever writes these speeches for the Government had the insensitivity to call this power up. It will amount to €77 per week. That will not power up a lot in this day and age. Such audacity. That is the kind of a bubble the Government is in. It has such a false sense of security thinking it can buy votes and buy the people. The grant is for businesses paying rates of under €30,000. I have a case of a hotel in south Tipperary. Its VAT bill last year was €30,200 and it was denied the payment. In actual fact, it applied and got the payment and then had to pay it back. It is the same issue. It is not being increased either. It is so unfair that it is not a sliding scale. If a business is €200 over the threshold, it will get nothing of the €5,000 that was given this year and €4,000 last year. The Government has to be able to tweak these schemes.",

Four in every ten houses built in this country are bought by these vulture funds, investment companies or whatever we want to call them. Since the Government has come into power, the number has increased by 223%, with, as I said, four in every ten homes now being bought by these investment companies. How can ordinary people get a home? The Government can window-dress this all it likes and play around with bits and pieces of money here and there. Incidentally, it is taxpayers' money and the Government does that do them.",
                "The increase in the carbon tax by €7.50 per tonne is another punitive measure on ordinary people, road hauliers, the agriculture industry and anybody who has to put fuel in a machine, car or anything else. As I said, there are inflationary pressures in the budget. The Government is increasing spending by 6.9%, exceeding its own recommendation of a 5% threshold. This will drive up inflation, as warned by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, potentially adding €250 to household costs according to the Central Bank. Yet, the Government goes along with this folly because it wants to buy the election and voters. I hope the voters will see through it and will not be so foolish. I remember in 1977 an election was bought. Other elections were also bought and we paid dearly for them.",
                "The challenges for SMEs are enormous. The Government does not seem to get it. Across the board, it is bringing in regulation after regulation and makes things more cumbersome. A company with six or seven employees would definitely need one secretarial assistant to deal with all the regulation. It is form after form. Regulation has mushroomed; it is crazy.",
                "As I said, the inflationary pressures on the budget are crazy. When we had a surplus and huge sums, we could do something about it and give something meaningful. As Deputy Shanahan said, we could also be a bit visionary, as the late T. K. Whitaker was, and do something with the money we have, rather than patching holes and being self-serving. Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Greens, who are going to obliterated, are trying to buy the voters to get back into power again. We have a long-term responsibility and duty of care to our people and our forefathers who built this country, supported it and put it where it is, not to fritter it away on election promises and spin. The Government has more spin doctors now than it has anything else. There are overruns and nothing can be built. It seems no project can be done by the OPW or by any of the Government's procurement companies. There are massive overruns and nothing can be done. However, the enablers, the self-employed people who want to do it, will not be let do it. It is an opportunity lost. Of course, the Ministers concerned will not even stay in the House to listen. It was the height of ignorance earlier that everybody fled from the Chamber when Sinn Féin Members were given their time."

                "In recent days, I see Bertie Ahern had a secret meeting with Simon Harris. It is little wonder that he taught him about leaks and spins. Leaks usually come out of Fianna Fáil but they are now starting to come out of Fine Gael, with the leaks we had in recent weeks relating to the budget. It is like a bucket with no ass in it. At one time, when the budget took place nobody knew until budget day exactly what was going to happen. Everybody knew what was going to happen prior to this one. There was one thing we did not know, however, and the hospitality is absolutely furious about it. People in the sector from throughout the country are sending me messages about how they have been let down by this Government. It is an appalling travesty that the VAT rate the Government raised from 9% to 13.5% has not been decreased despite promises. Members of the VAT 9 Now group were up in Leinster House last week. I presume they were brought up here on a lick and promise. They thought the reduction was going to happen. Now, of course, Fine Gael is saying it wanted it to happen and Fianna Fáil and the Greens did not want it. That, of course, is finger-pointing, which is what happens when you are coming close to election.",
                "What matters here is that 270,000 jobs have been put in jeopardy. Over 600 cafés and restaurants are after closing in the past few months. The sector is in a desperate situation. The lower wage being increased is always to be welcomed but that is another increase for those businesses. They have to make payouts and they cannot afford them. Fáilte Ireland will spend millions promoting this beautiful country over the next few months but what tourists will see when they come here is empty commercial buildings for sale or lease because people are closing their doors. They cannot afford to stay in business. I obviously have limited time. I would like to spend my seven and a half minutes speaking on behalf of those people. I have met them. As Deputy McGrath just mentioned, we all met them. I met Peter and Elaine from The Fish Basket in Rosscarbery, Jim Edwards from Kinsale and people from The Townhouse O D's in Schull. All these businesses are in a desperate position. They pleaded with the Government to understand that but it did not understand it. It turned its back at a time when it says the country is awash with money. It has let these businesses down shockingly. No one running these businesses or any of their employees should answer the door when these people come knocking on it for votes. This will not be forgotten.",
                "This budget robbed Peter and paid Paul. It provides for fuel increases. It gives extra pension to the elderly, which I fully support. It reduces the USC charge but we should remember that Fine Gael promised to drop the USC altogether. It has only been decreased, so that was a false promise because it was not delivered. The charge should never have even been introduced in the first place. Then the Government turns around and gives a fuel increase. It is robbing Peter and paying Paul. The fuel increase will hurt everybody who pulls up at a filling station. It will add to 2.5 cent to the price of a litre of diesel and 2.1 cent to the price of a litre of petrol. Families cannot afford that. This budget is going to hit the working man and woman hard as usual. They are going to be penalised. These are people who have to go to work in the morning, take the kids to school and use a vehicle to get from A to B. The Government knows that is an easy catch. The cost of home heating oil and a bag of coal is going up. There is no sympathy whatsoever for those people who are going to be caught in that trap. They have little or no other choice. The Government is saying some of the carbon tax, which is only a farce to keep the Green Party happy, will help with the warmer homes scheme. Apart from those in denial, every politician knows it takes two years. It took two years before the Green Party came into government for people to get their house into the warmer home scheme. It still takes two years. It makes no odds. It is not any faster or any different.",
                "On agriculture, what I could gather is there is a lot of talk about schemes but that is a continuation of what was already there. In one, the Government said it will look into schemes for next year's budget. What is wrong with this year's budget in relation to agriculture? Why could this year's budget not be looked into?",
                "Fianna Fáil, the Green Party and Fine Gael decided to pursue the residential zoned land tax. It is here to stay, despite pressure from farmers heaped on TDs and Senators from the coalition parties. The surprise today from the Minister for Finance, Deputy Chambers, is that the residential zoned land tax is here to stay and the only compromise is that farmers will be given an exemption in 2025 if they seek to rezone their land. In effect, this means downsizing from a valuable residential zoning into agricultural zoning. Fianna Fáil has caved in yet again and tax-hungry Greens have put another nail in the farming coffin, but they do not care.",
                "To be honest, I do not think I heard any Minister speak about fisheries today. It is astonishing that although we are surrounded by water, neither of the two Ministers spoke about fisheries or what aids are available for pelagic and inshore fishermen, who are experiencing serious difficulties at this time. The Ministers have turned their backs on them. I have continuously said there ought to be a stand-alone Minister for the marine, fisheries and the islands. They are forgotten; they are the forgotten people.",
                "The Ministers said they have put extra money into the carers’ pockets and I respect that if they have done so. However, we are adamant that there should be no means test for carers. If somebody looks after a person in their home or looks after a neighbour, why are they means-tested? We are in a position where no hospital beds are available for elderly people if they need to stay long-term in hospitals. What do we do? We make sure to penalise those who try to care for others instead of supporting them. We are told we cannot have home helps for all sorts of strange reasons, and even though we are told there are plenty of hours available and plenty of funding, it is not happening on the ground. That is why the carers are another issue.",
                "While talking about health, will there be extra funding for beds for the elderly? It is a crisis in west Cork, where people are in medical wards and cannot find a long-term nursing home or community hospital bed. West Cork has fewer beds, not more. There is also the issue of reimbursement for cataract surgery. The Minister of State, Deputy Burke, was critical of me in an article in one of the newspapers a couple of years ago for taking people to the North. Has the Government increased the reimbursement today for the people it took money from recently? I hope the Minister of State has delivered for the people of his constituency in Cork, who are in a crisis and cannot get a cataract operation in Cork, or has he turned his back on them once again?",
                "Reference was made to funding for Uisce Éireann. Is it going to deliver? Is the money going to go to those at the top notch and none to the ground level? Is Shannonvale going to get its scheme this coming year? Is Dunmanway going to get its scheme this coming year? In Warren Beach in Rosscarbery, people are drinking raw sewage. Is it going to get its scheme? Goleen has been 25 years waiting and Shannonvale has been 29 years waiting. Are they going to get schemes or are they going to be kicked down the road, like everything else?",
                "With regard to pensions, the Green Party claims it looks after everybody. Does it look after everybody? Where are the women's pensions in this country? Every Minister and TD in government should be called out. How many women come into my constituency office every week to say their pension has been taken from them or they never got a pension because their husband got a pension? That is an outrageous attack on the ordinary, good, hard-working women of this country. Whether they worked at home or worked outside, most of them have no pension. It is a disgrace that their pensions have been taken. The Ministers should hang their heads in shame on that issue. The women of Ireland asked me to say that."

However, my overall sense is that these measures are short-term and are reflective of the short-term thinking of the Government. In other words, they are electioneering, and that is the only way that many people are looking at this, unfortunately.",
                "Given the limited time I have, I can only speak in general terms on most items. What I will say is that taxpayers and citizens are being dazzled by this magpie’s budget, with its nest full of shiny policy objects, but all that glitters is not gold, as we well know. The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, for example, has repeatedly warned that the Government is breaching its own national spending rule in the billions of euro it is allocating to spending and tax cuts. In fact, we know from data provided by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council that because of this approach, consumer prices will be 1.9% higher cumulatively due to the breaches of the rule. In real terms, this equates to adding €1,000 to typical yearly household outgoings. Is this the mark of fiscal responsibility so treasured by Fine Gael?",
                "While there is a lot of fiscal smoke and mirrors going on, we also need to be realistic. I understand this from a political perspective. Budget day is political theatre and very little else. This year, it is the theatre of the absurd. We have record levels of financial surplus and we are awash with cash, but our national debt is an eye-watering €200 billion. What have we to show for that? Our services are creaking at the seams, disabled children are unable to access basic services and the sick are being forced abroad in record numbers to access basic healthcare that they cannot access here in a timely fashion. Children and adults in my constituency of Laois-Offaly cannot find a dentist or GP. If this is progress, then stop the train because we badly need to reverse course. In Offaly alone, there are now 81 people waiting for GP assignment. At the end of this Government's tenure, we have a homelessness and housing crisis that is an affront to man and God. We are one of the richest nations on earth, according to some assessments, but our single greatest asset, our children and young people, are being squeezed financially or forced abroad.",
                "Until the dying minutes of its regime and through its own sheer gutlessness, the Government has refused to face up to the measures needed to reduce the vast numbers involved in illegal inward migration. It has allowed the growth of an entirely new phenomenon, the asylum-industrial complex. This is draining billions from the taxpayer, with estimates that Government costs are now running at over €5 million per day just to maintain a socially catastrophic policy. It is the most expensive virtue-signalling policy in history.",
                "Our farmers’ incomes have been decimated. It is disappointing to see that despite the small measures, not enough has been done for farmers. Hauliers have again been let down and are facing an increase in fuel costs and carbon tax. The hauliers and farmers are the backbone of our rural economy, as are the small restaurants and cafés that still have to endure a 13.5% VAT rate. Since last September, 577 restaurants and cafés have closed their doors and, unfortunately, we are going to see many more close their doors. This is because of the short-term thinking of the Government. Spending was not targeted at employers or the businesses that create so much employment. I am speaking in particular of rural Ireland, where the hauliers, farmers, small cafés, restaurants and hairdressers were hit by the refusal of the Government to reduce the VAT rate. We need these people. I again call for something to be done.",
                "Giving businesses energy credits and other small, tokenistic measures is not going to work in the long term and is actually letting the energy companies off the hook.

The Government could do that if it had the political will to do it.",
                "I believe the Government will make farmers’ lives even more difficult because of the fact they are being forced to meet green targets. The shiny green policy is only deepening the economic assault on Irish farmers who, as I said, are the backbone of our economy but are not getting enough support. As the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council notes, if the State does not achieve a timely green transition, it faces substantial non-compliance costs. We need to stop the madness. We need to stop billions of euro of taxpayers’ money being wasted and squandered on green policy when the Government is leaving businesses very much alone and unsupported."

In the Government's budget, it said that it would provide more beds. It cannot provide the beds if it does not provide nurses and carers. That is what is wrong.

I am talking about County Kerry because the people there have been contacting me yesterday, last week and last month. We have been lobbying the Government. We asked, pleaded and begged the Government but to no good. The Government turned around and abandoned them. Some 615 restaurants have closed in the past year. A measly grant will be provided to businesses which will be eaten up by the wage increases. I am not against the increase in the wages but they do have a ripple effect on employers.

At a time when the Government has to pipe the money out of their way, it cut the pensions of those four women in Kerry yesterday. They are left with nothing and are now relying on one pension going into the house, that of their husband. Has the Government got something against women, where it picks on the women's pension? Why?

The Government increased the means test threshold to €625 for a single person and €1,250 for a couple instead of abolishing the means test.

It was a battle to get that out of the Government for them. Why would the Government do that to people? It did that. It cannot claim it did not because it did. We spoke about it here in the Dáil.

These are just people who, because of where their land is located and because they still continue farming, are being treated as though it is a massive asset and that they will start building houses. It is growing grass they want, not to be building housing.",
                "With regard to housing and 10,000 new social houses, how many will be allocated to be built in County Kerry and, importantly, when will we finally get an affordable housing scheme in Kerry? More than 200 social housing units are being provided in Killarney town by an approved housing body. I welcome that and they are under construction. It is great news but when will we have something by way of affordable housing for young people? Every day, in places like Killarney, Tralee, Killorglin, Cahersiveen and Sneem, young people ask me why we will not do something to provide homes they can buy. They are not looking for them for nothing but they want them to be affordable. There is the help-to-buy scheme for the first-time buyers but second-hand properties are not included yet again. When will the Government wake up and realise that a first-time buyer is a first-time buyer whether the house is brand new or second-hand? This is not very complicated. If the Government were to listen to this it is very easy to understand.",
                "Of course tax relief is the thing that people would shout about. In case anybody says that I have a conflict of interest, of course I am declaring my interest but when it comes to tax relief and the people who provide accommodation, why do they not get some form of incentive, such as that put in place for the Ukrainian people whereby people could get €100 a month tax free? Why do we not have the same thing for Irish people? Why do we not have tax incentives for people who are providing accommodation for Irish people? Why should it be one for one and none for the other? That does not make sense and it is not fair.",
                "With regard to roads, I am glad to see an extra €400 million for the Department of Transport. I had to come in here last week begging and scraping to seek to get back the roads that had been taken off, or should we say shelved? I am very glad that those have gone back now to Kerry County Council and are going to tender. I welcome it. It is the road up to Bunane and the road below it to Kinacross and out into Fossa and Faha. There are schemes that are back on the road now again, thankfully, but the Government did not want to do it because the Greens wanted to take them off. When will the crumbling national road sector in Kerry benefit? The N21 from Tralee through Castleisland and up to the county bounds is in seriously poor repair. The surface of the N23 from Farranfore to Castleisland is very poor. The N70 Ring of Kerry road and, of course, Tahilla to Blackwater is a disgrace. I travelled it last night at 1.30 a.m. before coming here this morning and could not close my eyes - although there was no fear of falling asleep - because of the rattling and the banging going along in the car. We also need to properly fund local improvement schemes."

                "I would like to put forward a question to the people in Ireland and to all the different generations of people who have voted for Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Green Party and other parties. I ask them today whether their children and grandchildren are for sale because that is what this budget is. The Government is trying to buy the votes of those who have voted for those parties for decades. I will break it down for the people of Ireland who have voted for those parties for years and ask them again why they are going to sell out their children and their grandchildren.",
                "First, there are the fuel costs. The Government has raised the cost of fuel with the carbon tax. What does that mean to people in Ireland? On one side the Government is giving them an increase - and I welcome all the increases being given - but on the other side I want to see people being able to withstand the increases so they do not have to raise their prices. Let us take transport, for example. Everything that comes here and there to every household in Ireland uses transport. The Government has increased a carbon tax for every person who has a vehicle in this country. It includes the haulage sector, the person who goes out working and who has to drive to work because there is no transport network, the taxi service and the private bus operator. The Government has just taxed every single one across the country in carbon tax. The Government has already taken 50% of fuel costs in taxes and it has gone past that now in taxes.",
                "There is also an effect to the raising of the minimum wage, a raise which I welcome. As an employer myself I welcome it but on the other side, one must look at the people who have to sustain the increases. How are they going to sustain the increases in the hospitality sector, for instance? We asked the Government to reduce the VAT rate from 13.5% to 9%. The Government brought them all up here last week or the week before and said it was going to do something for them. They now know that there are two standards to the Government. It will bring them up, hoping for the best, but will send them home. That 13.5% VAT rate means the hospitality sector and all the small cafes and small restaurants that are putting people through college and helping them go through college also now face an increase in wages. While I welcomed this measure, the Government has given the sector nothing to sustain it. What have they got to do now? They must pass the costs onto people coming into their restaurants to eat. They must put up the price of a cup of coffee. The last time the Government raised the VAT rate from 9% to 13.5% it put 70 cent onto the price a cup of coffee. It put €4 onto a plate of food and now the Government has done it again. Not only has the Government crippled the businesses that are trying to employ people in this country it is now putting them out of business. Last year, 615 businesses went out of business. I want to ask people from every one of the Government parties, when they are visiting Limerick or Galway, to go around to the people in the hospitality sector and ask them if they are happy with the Government. They are not going to be happy. The Government parties have come up here for decades doing the same thing but they have destroyed the people who actually put in the work and built communities and villages.",
                "Reference was made to infrastructure but the infrastructure is only built in populated areas. The Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, might go around Limerick. For 40 years they have been waiting for an upgrade on the sewage system in Askeaton. Two thirds of Limerick, including Oola, Kilfinane and Dromcolliher - I will go through all of them if the Minister of State likes - have sewage systems that are defunct. For decades, the Government has been saying it was going to put money into infrastructure. Now it talks about infrastructure today through Uisce Éireann. I asked Uisce Éireann last month for a breakdown on funding that was put into the scheme in Croom, County Limerick. I got an email back today that €5 million had been spent in upgrading a water pipe to Croom for the surrounding areas. They have been bringing in truckloads of water for the last month and putting it into the pipes to keep water in the pipes at a cost of €200,000. That is what it has cost. Uisce Éireann is leaking at the seams and yet the Government keeps pumping money into it. It is not value for money.",
                "Consider the sports capital grants, again which I welcome.",
                "Every sports capital grant application is done by volunteers, putting the paperwork together to seek funding. Everything they do in their criteria is value for money. Why? It is because they have to meet the Government criteria. However, if the Government does any infrastructure, such as a bike shed costing €336,000 or €1.4 million for a security hut, it goes over budget on every single thing. The children's hospital is an example of the lack of accountability from any person in government. That is a problem.",
                "We now go to the health sector. I welcome the increases that came for the carers but they asked the Government to do away with the means test. Again, the Government failed them. What did the Government do on the other side? For carers who have to travel around the country, the Government decided to give an increase here but to take it back from them in carbon tax. This takes it back from people in their day-to-day living, buying groceries, with the tax on the trucks that bring the food to shops. It is a tax on people driving to work and collecting their children. It is all about tax. This is what the Government has done. It has taken it from the poor to give it to the rich, when it should be the other way around. The Government should be protecting the people. It has no concept of what can be built in a community and what a community can deliver. There is no accountability on the part of the Government.",
                "Let us look at the hospital service and UHL in particular. I have been here for five years giving out about UHL. The Government has now finally set up an investigation into six people in the hospital. Some €56 million has been wasted on legal fees fighting cases, when the Government should just have admitted there was something wrong and attempted to fix it. During those five years, Aoife Johnston has passed away, God rest her soul. The case of Jessica Sheedy in Limerick has been waiting six years for an investigation. During this time, someone is being fully paid while the investigation is going on and the Government has not brought this up. Every time they look at something, it has been delayed. There is no accountability.",
                "Today, I listened to the two Ministers giving their speeches and they mentioned farming. Then they mentioned carbon tax. The same people who are trying to help us with carbon - the foresters - are thrown to the wolves with the ash dieback problem. Eamon Ryan wants to let the wolves run around the countryside. The people who have been affected by ash dieback have been failed by the Government with the importation of trees. These people have been offered a measly €2,000 per acre to get rid of the forestry they have and replant it, after 30 years. The people who are trying to protect the planet have been screwed over by the Government with taxes. Are the children and grandchildren of the people who have voted for Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael for decades for sale for the sake of a couple of euros in a budget made by civil servants for civil servants?"

We knew exactly what would be in the budget long before it was laid before us. I read the full breakdown of budget measures in The Irish Times yesterday, which is beyond ridiculous. Why do we continue with the farce of a budget day special when it is all out there already anyway?",
                "I find it very cynical of the Government to manufacture a week's worth of budget coverage to distract from its many failings, as well as other important issues. I am sure it suits the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, to have the budget this week, as well as all the pre-budget coverage last week, to distract from his secret call to assure the Israeli finance minister that the Government would block the occupied territories Bill. This is a disgraceful and deceitful move by the Minister and one that will not be forgotten over a package of one-off measures, because that is all this budget amounts to. It is not the systematic change that is so desperately needed. It is just a lacklustre repeat of the previous years' budgets, with very little for the public to be truly hopeful about.",
                "The budget offers absolutely nothing in the way of long-term change or improved access to services. It merely throws out a couple of euro to everyone in the audience, including those who do not require it, in a desperate attempt to keep as many people as possible happy in an election year. When the Government took this approach three years ago, its argument was that a targeted approach would take time to figure out and ensure. Yet, this excuse falls flat when the Government continues to throw money at those who will not even notice its presence and refuses to ensure targeted measures and funding are aimed at those struggling to get by. It is disgraceful that the budget treats both these groups the same. This is far from the equitable society the Minister promised.",
                "For starters, this document does nothing to actively address the worst housing and homelessness crisis in the history of the State. We have recorded more than 14,000 homeless people in the country. The Simon Communities of Ireland, in its recent report entitled Hidden Homelessness, revealed that hidden homelessness impacts a further 30,000 across the island of Ireland. There is no affordable housing available for those looking to buy a home. Any TD who spends time in his or her constituency office will know this. House prices will only continue to rise. In Donegal, prices in the third quarter of 2024 were 12% higher than a year previously. The average price of a home in Donegal is now 65% above the level of that at the start of the Covid 19 pandemic. The Government's responses are to increase the threshold so that fewer people will have to pay inheritance tax and to extend the help-to-buy scheme. This scheme does nothing but push up house prices and very few people are actually even eligible for the scheme, given that it only intended for houses built after 2017. One will find very few houses built after 2017 in rural Ireland and so the Government's claim that it is helping all first-time buyers is just not true. Builders are the ones being helped by this scheme.",
                "The first home shared equity scheme is just as ineffective because it only applies to new-build houses. However, the budget 2025 expenditure report details that a further €80 million will be spent on the scheme, while, shockingly, only a meagre €21 million will be spent on Traveller-specific accommodation and just €70 million will be set aside for the remediation of homes affected by the defective concrete blocks and apartment defects. Some €210 million is needed to ensure a 100% redress for homeowners affected by defective blocks alone. Despite this, there is not a single mention of the defective blocks' scheme in the budget. This is a disgrace and shows that the Government has no compassion for affected homeowners.",
                "Neither does it seem to have care for the one in two people in Ireland who will experience a mental health difficulty, either directly or indirectly. Mental health was not a priority in last year's budget and barely got a mention, despite the fact that just €1 spent on mental health returns €18 to the State. I am disappointed but not surprised to see that this year's budget is not much better. Again, allocated funding for mental health is far below any other health funding. It is clear that the Government does not take mental health seriously enough. I welcome the intended funding for Traveller mental health initiatives but we have to ensure that this funding goes directly to the National Traveller Mental Health Network as is actually drawn down and used for its intended purpose, unlike Traveller-specific accommodation funding. We need to ensure a more equitable healthcare system and move away from the two-tiered system currently in place and which is encouraged by these Government policies.",
                "Our disabled community has also, once again, been let down by this budget. We know that significant additional costs are faced by people with disabilities, which are not met by existing social welfare payments. Yet, the Government continues to contribute to a national savings account, instead of increasing payments sufficiently or establishing a permanent cost-of-disability payment. I and many DPOs have been calling for this measure for years. It should not be the case that thousands of disabled children and adults are unable to access basic support services and equipment, with this being accepted and left unaddressed. We need to establish a permanent cost-of-disability payment of at least €50 per week for disabled people and we need to abolish the means test for carers entirely. If the Minister, Deputy Chambers, meant it in his speech when he said that carers play a fundamental role in our society, then he should put his money where his mouth is.",
                "The Irish National Teachers Organisation has advised that we need to invest in smaller class sizes. Reducing class sizes by two points has shown an improvement in student outcomes and allows teachers to deliver a quality education. We have also emphasised the need to restore the 1,700 assistant principal roles that were cut during the austerity period more than 12 years ago. This would improve school management and teacher retention. We also need to ensure a 20% increase in core grants, that is, the capitation and minor works grants, alongside increased ancillary services funding to meet the growing costs faced by schools.",
                "We also need to invest heavily in childcare to support working families. This budget has provided a 24% increase in funding for childcare, but this extra allocation is to account for the growing number of children in the system and will not bring down the extortionate fees that parents have to pay. In his budget speech, the Minister for Finance proudly stated that almost three quarters of our working-age population is now in employment with participation by female workers at the highest level ever. This does not take into account the fact that many parents and many mothers are forced to work, given that two incomes are now required to buy a house and to get by in this country. This is not something to be proud of. I would bet that many workers would rather not be faced with the equivalent of a second mortgage to pay to access work and childcare. I was glad to see the additional allocation for foster carers but more funding should be targeted at the children as well as the carers. Carers are supporting the needs of children from their own funds and Tusla is happy for this to continue. Significant investment is needed to ensure that the rights of every child and carer are upheld and that they have equal opportunities to thrive and achieve the best possible outcomes.",

The only problem is that today is a day when the Government has a lot of money. We did not have a fraction of it in 2013, 2014 or 2015. When you spend money, you need to spend it wisely. All the things I have mentioned needed money. I have gone through some of the budget measures. We are trying to go through all of the figures at the moment. I hope there are increased budgets for disabilities, children with autism and mental health because we are seeing major problems in those areas around the country and we need to help those people in society.",

For the number of houses we are talking about building, €1 billion is like peanuts to a monkey. If we are talking about building that number of houses, that sum will not cover the sewerage and water infrastructure, roads and so on that we will need to put in. That is right around the country because there are a lot of areas where the sewerage system needs upgrading. I heard someone on the radio today asking how we will spend all of this money we have. The fact is, over the past six months, 350 workers have been let go by two of the companies that do sewers and water for Irish Water because they had no money to spend. That is it. There are no ifs or buts about it. All those people were let go six months ago because the budgets were gone. We can put all the money we want towards housing but, at the end of the day, if you do not have that beginning in place, you are not going to get it done.",

It has been said on numerous occasions that there are 100,000 fewer youngsters under 40 who own houses now than there were ten or 15 years ago. That is a frightening statistic because they cannot afford it. We can have all the money in the world but it is like the HSE. We could throw all the money in the world into the HSE but if we do not have good managers to manage things and if we do not get value for money, we are wasting it. It is like throwing it into a bonfire on 23 June.",
                "While it was before the Minister of State's time, we have seen the likes of the modular homes. Modular homes are costing €445,000. Let us call it what it is; it is a half a house. It is 600 sq. ft. Houses in Dublin are smaller than those down the country. They are between 1,050 sq. ft and 1,200 sq. ft. We think they are dear and, by God, they are but around €600,000 will buy you one. However, if two modular houses have to be joined together, which are a half a house each, to make what we have in Dublin, we are at nearly €900,000 and may as well give up on it because it is like throwing money into a bonfire. It is absolutely disgusting to see that happening in Ireland. I recall bringing a company out to Coolock to meet the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien. This company was able to bring units from Germany and to supply them for between €70,000 and €80,000. Let no one tell me the ground works will not be done on that. It should be borne in mind that the sites are being supplied by councils around the country. It would be better to build a proper house than to go on with this craic. Someone has to call a stop to this type of waste. We should be getting three units for that €445,000 rather than one. We cannot keep going down that road. It is like winning the lotto, losing your head and going off. People have won the lotto and then run out of money. That is the problem. We are doing the same thing.",

We can give out about it and do whatever else we want but that is it. We will hear it said that this, that and the other is to be done but we cannot introduce deviations. If you offer someone something, you should draw it up right and say this is what we want and that is it. Otherwise, you can offer a design and build contract and that is it.

                "The other part of this budget relates to the agricultural sector. On a day when we had billions of euro to throw around the place, I looked at the agricultural estimates. There is approximately €100 million in measures but some of them are regurgitated. There is a bit for sheep, a bit for the forgotten farmer and a bit for the calf welfare scheme but it is small money at €5 million, €10 million or €8 million. I saw everyone below at the ploughing a few weeks ago. Politicians that would be seen on TikTok were putting their arms around the farmers. They were the greatest thing since the sliced pan when these politicians could see 200,000 of them when an election was coming up. The farmers got their answer today, however. They got a kick in the ass from this Government. Today's budget does not respect farmers. Wages in the Department are up 10%, which is something like €30 million. There are also running costs and all of that. That is fine. I do not have a problem with it but, at the end of the day, when we see the money that is being kicked around today, we have to think about the farming sector. Nothing has been done for the suckler herd, which has fallen by 40,000 cows. Damn all has been done for the sheep sector, which is down 6%. Do we have any vision for young farmers in this country? Does the Government know what we will do for them? We will give them a few small bits but we will raise the carbon tax to make sure that, when they go out with the tractor, where there is no electric one, they will get screwed a bit more. That is not the way to treat the agricultural sector.",

We are going to set up a crowd to look at this for the budget in 2025. Do you know what? Is there to be an election before then? It all depends. That may go out the window depending on the programme for government.",

Today, we had an opportunity to give a bit of light to youngsters in farming, to try to get them into it, to make the sector more productive and to give an incentive to older farmers to retire. Do we want a farmer to just be going from the farm to the church? That is what we are looking at because the Government wants to keep them working like hell all their lives. People can retire from every other job but, unfortunately, no retirement scheme has been brought in for this sector. It is a disappointing day for the whole agricultural sector. I know there is a bit for the grain men but look at the price of grain today. Everyone is talking about how we are importing stuff. If we do not want to import it, let us get our own to grow it. Let us give the people growing grain right around the country the incentive to grow it. That is how to do it.",

                "My contribution will be an overview of the budget and its context. It was a huge opportunity for the Government to examine the fundamentals in our society that need to be addressed. Instead, this budget is the final nail in the coffin for any idea that Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party Government has any plans or intentions to address the problems the country is facing. They are throwing money at people and hoping they will not realise that when these once-off payments are gone - even though they are welcome and anybody getting a double childcare payment twice before Christmas will welcome it - there will still not be enough houses, doctors, services or baseline money coming into people's pockets to allow them to live a decent life in this country.",
                "The Government parties have tried to buy the next election, but in the process they have given up any pretence to have answers for anyone struggling to make ends meet. They are giving once-off payments in an attempt to distract from the fact that the Government is playing catch up with itself after decades of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Governments that have left a State collapsing under the strain of cuts, privatisation and bank bailouts. We have a surplus of €25 billion that could have been used to target any one of the crises that have developed under the two parties' decades of rule. With that money, we could build tens of thousands of homes under a State-run housing development agency. We could develop a world-leading mental health service or eliminate child poverty and homelessness. We build the services and infrastructure this country is screaming out for. Instead, fundamentally, we get once-off payments that might keep some people's heads above water, but when those payments are gone, how many people will the Government leave who will be living pay cheque to pay cheque or social welfare payment to social welfare payment and struggling without the services or homes we all need?",
                "This budget is a last hurrah of five years of failure by this Government to implement the changes the country needs. Housing prices and rents are still going up while the Government plays catch up with the delivery of social housing, which has been abandoned for decades under the watch of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. We have a health service with recruitment freezes while the Government allows skyrocketing overspend on what might be the most expensive hospital ever built. We have public services that are falling apart at the seams. The Government has made it clear again and again that it lacks the political will to address these problems. It has given up. It does not have a plan. It had no real intention in the first place.",
                "In his speech, the Minister for Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, called eliminating child poverty an absolute priority for this Government. More than 250,000 young children and their families are under the poverty line. The rates of children living in material deprivation and at risk of poverty have risen since 2020 under the Government. This budget was an opportunity to try to resolve these issues. It is, of course, welcome that the hot schools meal programme will be extended to all primary school children and that children aged under nine will not be paying bus fares. However, the ESRI published an extremely detailed roadmap for eliminating child poverty in its third annual report on poverty last year. The Government has failed on every single one of the measures that the ESRI studied. There is no significant increase for a qualified child, no significant increase to the working family payment, no second tier of child benefit and none of the measures that everyone knows we need to take to make a meaningful impact on child poverty rates.",
                "Let us not forget that we have record child homelessness, with an increase of more than 60% since the Government took power. The Ombudsman for Children has called child homelessness a traumatic breach of the rights of children. Is that the record of dealing with child poverty that the Government is celebrating? I do not know what world the members of the Government live in when they stand up here and pat themselves on the back when they have failed by every measure to take any real targeted action on child homelessness or child poverty in this budget. It has abandoned thousands upon thousands of children to deprivation and homelessness. Children are spending their childhoods in hotel rooms or emergency accommodation, with nowhere else to live. Children are growing up seeing their parents struggling to keep them fed, keep them warm and keep them clothed as wages and social welfare do not rise to meet the cost of living. The Government is patting itself on the back for leaving the most vulnerable behind while it gives tax cuts to multimillionaires.",
                "Those children need targeted supports. Children on scoliosis waiting lists, on waiting lists for surgery or waiting for additional needs assessments need targeted supports. People with disabilities need the implementation of the cost of disability report. Instead, everybody gets a bump. Whether it is a child growing up in poverty or a multimillionaire, they get the same. These once-off allocations could have been done with the €25 billion surplus and there would still have been enough revenue increases to make real interventions and to make transformational change in people's lives.",
                "In my area, we have staff in a primary care centre on Old County Road telling older people referred from hospitals that they have no idea what they are being referred to the centre for because it does not have a single public health nurse to deal with them. In Dublin 8 and Dublin 12, there are no early childhood checks because there are no public health nurses. This budget will not give Dublin 8 and Dublin 12 more public health nurses. There is a geographical health deprivation in our area in respect of public health nurses, and I have raised that matter time and time again. I have people coming to me concerning broken sewage pipes in the back gardens and on public roads, and they have been told by Irish Water that it cannot help them this year and they will be put on a waiting list to perhaps get help to them in 2025. These problems would have been dealt with under the local authorities by their water workers before the advent of Irish Water. People would not have been left in this situation with Irish Water saying it does not have the resources.",
                "The budget will not change the long-term economic situation for a woman I am dealing with. She has been working for a State-supported entity for the past 14 years and has not had any real pay increases over those years. She went to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, as the statutory body to assist in resolving workplace disputes and complaints. The service is fully funded by the public through the Exchequer. The Government set it up as a voluntarist approach to industrial relations. The WRC adjudicated that this woman would get an increase from €14 to €14.85 per hour from 1 April 2023, but the Government's State-supported entity is refusing to pay her. The Government's budget and its policies will not fundamentally change her situation.",
                "I am also dealing with a woman stuck in one room in her parents' house. Every TD is dealing with these issues every day in their constituency offices. People have been on the housing list waiting list for 15 to 18 years waiting to get a three-bedroom house or apartment. None are being built so they are still languishing on the waiting list. Thousands of children are also waiting for medical care, surgeries, assessments of need and school places. This budget will leave them where they are. I have lost count of the number of people coming to my office who cannot find a home, cannot make the rent, cannot get anywhere on the housing list or are being evicted. This budget will do nothing for them. The Housing Commission called for an increase in the size of the social and cost-rental housing sectors to 20% of the national housing stock. The Government has budgeted for 10,000 new social houses next year, which is a drop in the ocean and it is not even an increase on last year.",
                "We are a wealthy country but working-class people see none of it. The top 1% in Ireland owns €232 billion in wealth, whereas the bottom 50% of the population owns only €9 billion in wealth. That level of inequality cannot go on. It is ruining people's lives. There is a deep need for change so ordinary people can get their fair share.",
                "Over the past five years, the Government has proved time and time again that it has no interest in bringing about this change. Decades of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Governments, propped up by the Green Party and the Labour Party, have left Ireland as a country where the rich keep accumulating more wealth and everybody else struggles to get by. What we need is a Government that will not govern for the wealthy. Ireland is one of the richest countries in the world, with budget surpluses of tens of billions of euro. We need a Government with the political will to do something with the money. What this budget has made clear is that the Government has given up. It is not going to resolve the housing crisis. It is not going to fix our health service. It is not going to change anything fundamentally and it thinks that people are stupid enough to forget all about this if they get a tax credit and lump sum. People will not be fooled by once-off payments when they know they still cannot afford a house. They will not be fooled while the Government lets the 1% and the multinationals run up hundreds of billions of euro in wealth and profits and they will not be fooled by a giveaway election budget by a Government that has given up on making any real fundamental change in people's lives."

However, notwithstanding that acknowledgement, the continuation of that approach by this Government is particularly shocking, particularly worrying and unacceptable given the challenges we face.",
                "It is 75 years since we made that wonderful declaration that we were a republic, which obviously is a work in progress. We have in the budget, for the first time, a surreal surplus of €25 billion, including €14.1 billion from the Apple case that the Government struggled gallantly not to take. That enables us to make the republic a reality in the real sense of what a republic means. The background to this budget that makes transformative action necessary is our declaration of a climate and biodiversity emergency in May 2019. In previous budget speeches, the Taoiseach, the former Taoiseach and various Ministers told us the world was burning but all of that type of language is gone, which is interesting in itself. We declared the emergency and then we had the Covid pandemic, both absolutely requiring transformative action but there is not a sign of that.",
                "We had the Housing Commission report earlier this year but it was never discussed in the Dáil. The commission stated: \"Housing must be a unique national priority, supporting social cohesion and economic development.\" It went on to say that the problems in housing have arisen due to the:",
                "...failure to successfully treat housing as a critical social and economic priority, evident in a lack of consistency in housing policy. Inconsistency undermines confidence. A consequence of these policy failures is that Ireland has, by comparison with our European partners, one of the highest levels of public expenditure for housing, yet one of the poorest outcomes ... Only a radical reset of housing policy will work.",
                "Did we get that in this budget? Absolutely not. The Government parties have continued to put their heads in the sand by renewing the help-to-buy scheme, which is pushing the price of houses to extraordinarily high levels. There is no increase in targets to the most minimal of requirements that should be considered.",
                "The number of people in homelessness has been normalised. We now have 14,486 people who are homeless. Any sensible government would say that is a policy failure. That total of 14,486 includes 4,316 children. More than 50% of renters need help from the State to rent, while rents continue to rise at 2.5 times the European average. When I mention homelessness of more than 14,000, I am not including the hidden homeless. Surely that is an indictment of our Republic. The Government claims that its housing policies are successful, even though the commission that it set up is clearly telling us that they are not. To tell us that the help-to-buy scheme is going to be extended is an absolute mockery. That we would need to give Government help to consultants and those earning good salaries, including TDs, to enable them to buy a house is totally unacceptable. I repeat the word \"mockery\".",
                "If we were truly interested in being a republic, or in working towards it, one of the most basic things that we would have introduced in this budget is a cost-of-disability payment. I welcome the various social welfare increases, although I might come back to that because they are not being benchmarked or placed in context but the one thing that would make a difference, a cost-of-disability payment, is completely ignored. The abolition of means-testing for carers did not happen. The means test is still there, even though we went to the trouble of having a referendum to tell carers that we thought they were wonderful for minding people who needed care. The Government said it was there for them, yet it retains the means test. We are awaiting a judgment in a Supreme Court case. A mother was forced to go all the way up through the courts and such is the importance of the case that the Supreme Court took charge of it, as I understand it. We are waiting on that. I worry that it might not be the ideal case to test what is being tested. Nevertheless, it is worth reading the judgments to date from previous court hearings and what was said about the burden that mother has to bear.",
                "Let me briefly refer to direct provision. I heard comments earlier today on direct provision but the Government's policy on it, as distinct from its policy on people from Ukraine, is absolutely wrong. The Government has used a divide-and-conquer mechanism whereby some people coming to our country are good and others are not. We decided a long time ago that direct provision was not acceptable. When I say \"we\", I am referring to the Day report in 2020 and the White Paper on Ending Direct Provision from the Government in 2021, which proposed going down the road of building not-for-profit centres. That has not happened. Not alone has it not happened but we have the Taoiseach of the country telling us that direct provision applicants are causing the homelessness problem or are part of it. It is shocking, divisive politics that is absolutely unacceptable. I am sure the Minister of State does not agree with that and I would love to hear his voice on it. As we talk about that, 6,500 individuals are still in direct provision, although they have refugee status and they cannot get out. Yesterday, I was in contact with the Minister for children again about a person who is living in a car, having been thrown out of direct provision in Galway to make room for other people. That is how cracked the policy is at the moment. That person is working full time, doing 12-hour shifts and is living in a car. The answer from the Minister in a letter to this person was to go to Dublin and get emergency accommodation. That would mean leaving their job, and then we castigate them for not wanting to work.",
                "With regard to indigenous industries, I despair with this budget. The Government has not even begun to consider the importance of indigenous industries, even though it has been warned by every organisation that deals with fiscal rectitude that we are overly reliant on a small coterie of foreign direct investors and we need to broaden our tax base, incentivise indigenous industries and look after our SMEs. None of that is happening at all. I think of seaweed, wool and of the fishermen in the coastal areas that have not been mentioned who are still waiting on a policy relating to sustainability for sprat and stopping the big boats from going in there.",
                "I will finish on infrastructure. I welcome that the budget mentions infrastructure but there is no plan or pathway. I come from a city where the sewage treatment infrastructure is collapsing. We have a plant that is functioning very well but the issue is with the collection and the pipes. One of them is in imminent danger of collapse and I referred to all of that last week. We cannot have balanced regional development or even balanced development within a city and county without the sewage treatment plan in Carraroe. None of that is happening. If the Government is finally taking a step, I welcome that.",
                "Finally, in the two speeches given today there was not one single mention of the homeless. The 14,486 homeless people were not mentioned. We had a Minister talking about hope and how important it is to give hope. The best way to give hope is to give shelter. A home is a basic human right. That is the best way to give hope, or at least to give a pathway to that, knowing that Government realises its policy is wrong and needs to be changed. It is not hope that I am taking out of today but hopelessness."

I actually voted for them in the previous budget and am glad to see they are being continued and that the Government is investing more in Irish Water and in the Land Development Agency. There are a few decent proposals on agriculture, including the provision whereby non-farmers who buy land will need to hold on to it for a minimum of six years and actively farm it before they can get a tax-free exemption from passing it on. There is a tax on e-cigarettes and a higher rate of stamp duty on the bulk acquisition of houses, which we tried to bring in earlier this year but the Government voted against us.",
                "All of those are positive aspects to this budget.",
                "The Government has kept the 9% VAT rate on electricity and on the installation of heat pumps but this is a massive sum. When a government has that kind of money available to it, we expect to see real impact, real change. We expect, as many people have said here today, to see a transformative budget. While there are, as I said, a number of politically very attractive decisions here, the Taoiseach said he would not apologise for any of them. Of course, why would he? They are vote getters. However, we need to look beyond the surface. We need to look at the substantive issues in this budget and how this money is being spent. It is not that Ministers puts their hand in their back pocket and says, \"Here's my money. I'm giving it to you.\" This is the taxpayers' money. It is not just about spending money; it is about how it is spent and where it is spent. It is about the vision, the transformation and value for money.",
                "I will give just one example of why I think the Minister is not so much dealing with the bread-and-butter issues but more with the jam on the top of the bread. We have the free schoolbooks scheme and free school meals, which, of course, we need. Parents are delighted to see them, and parents are voters. However, let us look at the education system, particularly the primary school system. Primary schools are on their knees. Capitation grants are totally inadequate. We have the highest pupil-teacher ratio in Europe and our teachers are emigrating. Those are the substantive issues. Of course, we need free schoolbooks and free school meals. No one could suggest that this deals with the substantive issues in education; this simply does not. That is my concern about certain parts of this budget. It underpins much of the thinking here. Of course, this is an election budget; let us not pretend it is anything else.",
                "We have decreased the cost of childcare for parents, which is hugely important because people need to be able to afford childcare. However, people also need to be able to access childcare. In my county of Sligo, six childcare providers have closed their doors this year. It was actually seven, but one has gone to a community service. They are closing because they simply cannot remain open and make a profit. The system that is in place is attractive and parents are very happy to see the costs are coming down, though not by enough but they are coming down. We cannot ignore the issue of accessibility so that childcare is available for parents. Some of these shortsighted measures do not deal with the totality of the issue that I have real concern about.",
                "The one-off payments are again a symptom of that. In fact, people welcome all of them because they represent money in their back pocket. However, if we really want to deal with poverty, whether it is child poverty or family poverty, we know that it is long-term social welfare increases that matter. There are a few of them in the budget. For example, I was glad to see that carer's allowance will be a qualifying payment for fuel allowance, which is really important, and that the qualifying age for fuel allowance has gone from 70 to 66 depending on the person's means. It is not as if the Government has none of this but it does not have enough. It has not made a substantive or transformative change in this budget.",
                "Somehow agriculture always seems to be a distant cousin when it comes to the budget - more of the same with a few extra euro thrown in here and there. One of the issues that really concerns me is that there is nothing about the efficiency of schemes, how they are delivered, how they are paid and the increasing red tape and bureaucracy. There will be extra money for ACRES, for example, but we need to consider how badly that scheme has been managed and the fact that farmers have lost faith in it. It is not just about money sometimes; it is also about how the schemes operate.",
                "The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, talked about four areas. He said our investment has resulted in many children benefiting from free schoolbooks and free school meals, etc. While I accept that, nobody on this side of the House looked at the perilous state of our education system. He talked about a significant increase in health expenditure. While I accept that, the numbers on trolleys have increased every year since this Government took office. My own hospital, Sligo University Hospital, is always in the top three, including today. It is just one behind Galway with 51 people waiting on trolleys. He talked about the number of new homes and he actually said that 116,000 new homes have been delivered since 2020. If we divide that by 4.5, because we have had this Government for four and a half years, that comes to 25,777 houses per year. We need twice that, as the Minister of State and I both know. That is, therefore, not an achievement. He talked about a record number of people in employment, which is true, but our young people are emigrating in droves because they cannot get housing. We need to manage both of those issues.",
                "I was hugely disappointed that the Minister did not reinstate the 9% VAT rate for hospitality businesses in the food sector. It will have a significant negative impact, especially in rural areas. There will be job losses and indigenous businesses will close. That is as sure as night follows day. The budget has placed increased costs on business. While we have increased the minimum wage, I am always bemused that the Government says, \"We increased the minimum wage.\" It is actually employers who pay the increased minimum wage. Governments need to support them to do that, especially small businesses.",
                "There is much more in this budget. I will have an opportunity to speak about some of it tomorrow. I agree with Deputy Connolly; I was really disappointed to see that no cost-of-disability payment was included in this budget. The Minister spoke about increasing numbers in the Defence Forces and improving their uniforms. He needs to look at improving their terms and conditions as well.",
                "There were only two mentions of balanced regional development in the whole budget - regional airports and urban regeneration. Given that the European Commission has ranked infrastructure in the northern and western region as 218 out of 234 European regions, those two items will not even begin to close that gap."

We know that electricity prices over the past three years have increased by almost 50% and gas prices have increased by more than 84%. Irish electricity prices remain among the highest in the European Union. All the while this is happening, the Government has refused to apply a windfall tax on electricity companies, allowing them to keep record profits at the expense of workers and families. Workers and families are seeing their bills go up time and again but there is no windfall tax, as we know, on the electricity companies. Figures released to my party show that 230,000 households were in arrears on their electricity at the end of April. We have provided for electricity credits of €450 for the autumn and winter but the Government really needs to do more with regard to the energy companies themselves. Look at a windfall tax and then make sure the money is ring-fenced to provide greater cost-of-living supports for workers and families."

                "I will move a Labour Party amendment to Financial Resolution No. 2. The Government motion intends to extend the 9% rate of VAT on electricity and gas until 30 April 2025. The measure is projected to cost €110 million, inclusive of November and December 2024, as it expires on 31 October. In our alternative budget, published last week, the Labour Party proposed this measure should be extended until the end of 2025. This would cost a total of €231 million or €120 million extra above what was allocated. As we know, bills remain 70% to 80% higher than pre-crisis levels. We do not have any proper measurement of energy poverty in Ireland but research by the Vincentian research centre shows the need for more supports and how even some A-rated homes cannot afford to cover their minimum needs.",
                "As Sadhbh O'Neill writes in The Irish Times today on another measurement by the CRU, its data shows domestic electricity prices were the ninth most expensive in Europe and gas prices were the fifth most expensive. As we know, it is the poor who pay more for energy. The Corrib gas field supplies us with approximately one third of our own gas but we have the fifth most expensive gas prices. One of the key reasons for this, as the Minister knows, is the explosion of data centres which are soaking up excess renewable energy added to the grid.",
                "It is clear that Ireland can afford an extended VAT rate. Prices remain far too high. The new PSO levy came into force today and will add €3.23 per month excluding VAT. Over a year it will add approximately €42. Further network charges could add an extra €100 to bills. A question the Minister might now also consider is, if the State is putting €750 million into the grid from AIB share revenues as was announced today, why extra charges will be passed onto consumers at all.",
                "To put it simply, our electricity and gas prices remain way above the EU averages. Energy poverty remains a big problem. State charges will add well over €100 a year to bills next year. Extending the 9% VAT rate on gas and electricity for all of 2025 would be a small but important step to help families throughout the country through this difficult time. I ask the Minister to accept our amendment."

This is not a popular thing to say but I am completely opposed to such a hike in the cost of cigarettes. I believe it is vindictive. It will not deliver the stated ambition of the Government. Yes, rates of smoking dropped from 27% in 2004 to 17% in 2019. This was due to the smoking ban, increased costs and other societal factors. Between 2019 and 2024 the rate increased by 1% despite the fact that prices increased by more than 34%. When we take into account that smokers suffer from the cost of living also, we are getting to the point of diminishing returns. I do not see how the Minister can justify a measure that will undoubtedly lead to increased prevalence of the black market and will penalise those people who are already smoking and who need our support rather than being penalised. I must also put on the record that the decision by the Government to put a charge on vapes is daft. I am a former smoker myself. Vaping helped me to come off cigarettes. It is a benefit. Yes, we want to prevent young people from beginning to vape but for those who smoke vaping is the best route out of it. We should support it as a better alternative rather than penalising people for making that choice."

I totally disagree with what the Minister said earlier, whereby he said it was the continuous increase in the cost of tobacco that has curbed smoking. I do not agree with this. Of course people are opting for a better and healthier lifestyle, and rightly so. I would be a lot happier if every young person never put cigarette into their mouth but among the people who are taxpayers and who are working perhaps there are people who have a nervous disposition and smoking cigarettes is something that they do.",

The group A threshold principally relates to gifts and inheritances taken by children from their parents. The group B threshold principally covers gifts and inheritances received from other close relatives such as siblings, uncles, aunts and grandparents. The group C threshold deals with gifts and inheritances between all other persons.",

The increased group thresholds will apply to gifts and inheritances taken on or after 2 October 2024. The increase in the amount of the group thresholds will cost an estimated €88 million for a year."

What it found is that only 30% of households, or less than one in three, have received an inheritance at some stage in their life. Two thirds of households will never get a substantial inheritance at all. Of that one third, which will tend to be the richest one third, the average inheritance that they get is €80,000, coming nowhere close to the existing threshold.",

This is a substantial tax break for some of richest people in the country. That is the reality. It is not as pure as the richest 3% in the country because it is impacted by how many children there are and so on. That is true, but basically it is a tax break for the richest people in the country at a time when approximately 4,500 children are growing up in hotels and emergency accommodation and will potentially be impacted by that for their entire lives. At a time when one in ten families is driven to use food banks to feed their kids, and one in three families says it has to cut back on meals to ensure the kids can eat properly, we have a Government that wants to ensure the children of some of the richest families in the country can get a tax break of another €21,450. It is scandalous. It has not gotten enough attention. The truth and reality of what a class-based measure this is, and the small number of people it benefits, has not been the focus of enough discussion. It is really scandalous that the Government is making this decision at a time when so many people struggle to get by."

Going back in time, if you were the son or daughter who inherited a farm, you were considered to be made for life. That is not the case anymore. The value of farms has gone up - there is no escaping that - which means that many young farmers starting out are landed with a massive bill to pay the capital gains tax, even at €400,000. You would not buy much of a farm now for €600,000 or €700,000. You would not live off that type of farm if you did not have something else. The threshold increase from €32,500 to €40,000 is completely inadequate. Again, it could be an uncle or someone. The increase from €16,250 to €20,000 is very low altogether given that the value of property is going up each day. Any fellow who takes over a farm has the ambition to hold onto it, try to make a living out of it and pass it on in better shape or as good as he got it."

It is not that I believe we should be throwing confetti up in the air in the budget and have everybody grabbing it. However, people paid for these properties. Most likely it is a farm or whatever. They are paying back the bank for this property. They are paying the property tax. They are paying for the repairs and the day-to-day running. Down on top of this, when they hand it over after all those years of payment, they are caught for inheritance tax if they are handing it on to their son or daughter or other family member. That is very unfair. I am surprised that people in this Chamber are objecting to that. That is a terrible infliction on people who have paid big money. As Deputy Danny Healy-Rae said, you are not going to buy a farm today for €100,000 or €200,000. You could pay up to €500,000 or €1 million for a farm. That is the bank being paid. When you have all those payments paid back after working mortally hard on your farm and your property, you are caught with a tax again at the end of it. It is a win-win situation for the State. It has made its money out of the property tax. It has made its money out of whatever other payments the farmer has had to make. The banks have made their money out of it. When the farmer comes to pass it on, they are going to bleed him dry. I believe that should be raised to €500,000. It is a hugely important issue. I know a decision has been made, but I do not think the Minister got the proper advice when he was making that decision. It is something we have looked into in recent times. I urge the Minister to make that change. I will not be supporting this unless the change is made."

If he studies the value of any type of property, be it a farm or any other asset, he will see that it is going up. At the end of the day, we have politicians in here who do not understand anything to do with farming, or with the value of land or any other type of property. They think that because a farm is worth a certain amount of money, that is something the farmer has. The Minister for agriculture understands this, but many Deputies in here have yet to grasp this nettle. I will explain easily what would happen if you were handed a farm tomorrow morning for nothing - if it was just given to you and you did not have to pay any capital gains or anything - and you were told to take that farm and make a living off it. The amount of land that is transferred in Ireland is minuscule. Why? Because it is transferred. People do not look on it as an asset or something that is worth €300,000, €400,000, €500,000 or €1 million. It makes no difference what it is worth because you are not bloody well selling it. What people are trying to do is just make a living and a profit out of it so they can call it a week's wages. People in here who are fully convinced talk about big farmers because they have a valuable farm. It does not matter if your farm is in the Black Valley or in County Kildare if all you are trying to do is make a living out of it. Again, people in here propagate this idea that whether it is houses or land or whatever it is, it is worth something. It is worth nothing unless you are selling it. If you are only holding it and trying to make a living out of it to pass it on to the next generation, people with farms adore their ground and all they want to do is improve it. I am saying the Government is not going far enough. If anybody looks at the way values have increased, they will see that this is not going far enough. When people inherit an asset, on the many occasions the first thing that happens is that they struggle to pay the tax."

The media and the politicians have all targeted the same people. They have said that people in households will be targeted or something at the end. That is not the case. I have even had people talking to me about this in my constituency office. These are people who will never have an asset worth this value, and they think they are going to be targeted. It is a big success for the Government in the way it has targeted this measure and made the public argument and discussion be about ordinary individuals and how they will be impacted. This is not aimed at them. This is aimed at wealthy business people so they can pass on assets at a reduced cost. That is what this measure is about."

                "It is certainly positive to see an increase in the level of stamp duty on the bulk purchase of homes, which I concede, but this simply does not go far enough. The Government resolution simply does not do enough to dissuade the bulk purchase of homes by institutional investors. We in the Labour Party had put down an amendment to increase the stamp duty rate to 20% on the bulk purchase of homes and, crucially, to remove the specific exclusion of apartment blocks. That is something that absolutely should be done and we are very disappointed our amendment has been ruled out of order. We had hoped it would be put because it would have given the Minister's Fine Gael colleagues, in particular, a chance to say whether they really wanted the rate set at 20%. Indeed, the Fine Gael Minister of State, Deputy Neale Richmond, specifically said back in September that he wanted to see a stamp duty rate of 20%. He said that Fine Gael would include that in its manifesto and he told The Sunday Times that the rate should be doubled to 20%. He said, rightly, that clearly there is an unacceptable level of bulk purchasing happening and this is to the detriment of people wishing to purchase their own home.",
                "Just yesterday, I stood in Mullen Park estate in Maynooth, which made news headlines three years ago when a large conglomerate, Ranhill Capital Sdn Bhd, attempted to bulk buy 115 homes in that estate. It was only then, in response to that deal, which eventually fell through, that the Government pushed through new rules in the form of hiked stamp duty to limit property funds from bulk purchasing homes. More needs to be done. I stood with Labour Party Councillor Angela Feeney in the estate, where now, happily, properties have been bought by individual buyers, but it is a real example of what can go wrong when bulk purchasing is facilitated and when a punitive rate is not applied to it. It shows the need to go further than the Government has done.",

This increase of 5% being put forward by the Government is pathetic. It shows it is clearly not serious whatsoever about stamping out the practice of multibillion euro funds coming in and snapping up homes, pushing up prices, and pushing out first-time buyers. We saw this happening earlier this year in Belcamp Manor in my constituency where 85% of the newly built homes were snapped up by a fund. Remember this tax and stamp duty applies to funds that buy up homes that are already built, that already exist and which could be made available to and be bought by first-time buyers. It pushes up house prices and makes housing even less affordable. It is a tokenistic 5% increase and is another example that shows this Government is all about the optics but is unwilling to take measures that actually work.",

Last year, there was a 58% increase in the number of homes where this stamp duty on bulk purchases was paid. It is an ineffective measure. Another 5% is not going to cut it. It needs to be an effective rate of 100% as proposed by the Social Democrats. These half measures are not going to work. It is clearly the case these investment funds are more than happy to pay out these kinds of stamp duties because they are making such gains by charging extortionate rents. It is no wonder home ownership is now at its lowest level in 50 years. In particular, it is very disappointing these higher stamp duty rates for bulk purchase do not apply to apartments as well. It would have been expected that the Green Party in government would have supported compact living, higher densities of apartment living and homeownership in apartments, but clearly it does not as this measure only applies to houses and duplexes."

Most of what is being built at the moment is apartments and these funds are buying them up en masse and then charging extortionate rents and passing on the cost. Whatever the constantly inflating cost is, this is passed on into extortionate rents to people who rent those properties, those who can afford them. We need to get these wealth asset management companies, as they like to refer to themselves, who manage the assets of the super-rich and who try to profiteer off the back of our housing crisis, out of the Irish market and out of the Irish housing sector.

This should have been done to end the scandalous practice of these vulture funds coming in and buying up homes that should be available for people who need them. The next time we have a debate in this House on the issue, and no doubt we will have more and certainly during the election campaign we will have a debate, the Minister and his party, and Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, will have to account for the fact that they have failed to take on the vulture funds and they have failed to protect people who want to own their own homes. They have failed on housing anyway in terms of all the targets they set and they have failed to deliver affordable homes. One of the key problems is vulture funds swooping in and buying those homes from under the feet of families who want to purchase their homes.

                    "I am a little disappointed that the senior Minister for housing is not here to answer on this very important issue. The Ringfort development in Rathmolyon, County Meath, has been plagued by mismanagement, delay tactics and questionable dealings that have left five families locked out of their homes for more than five years. It has been more than five years since couples put a booking deposit down on a home in the development. They signed contracts on homes that were being built and, instead of being in their new homes, they spent the past five years trapped in limbo, paying rent, storing furniture and living with a constant sense of uncertainty and frustration. They paid their initial €5,000 deposit in October 2020, followed by a balance of €24,500 in early 2021. One couple signed their contract in July 2021 and were told to expect completion within 18 months, by the end of 2022. That never happened. What began as small delays soon spiralled into a nightmare for these buyers. In early 2023, they were told by the developer that each buyer would need to pay an additional €60,000 to make the project viable. It was extortion. In May 2024, it was agreed to pay an additional €26,000 each to help move things along. A letter confirming this agreement was sent to solicitors. It was not subject to contract; it was open correspondence. The homebuyers accepted and signed, believing the end was near. By late 2024, every house on the site was structurally complete. The utilities were connected. All that remained were the final road surfacing and landscaping works. Now in 2025, a liquidator has been appointed, plunging everything back into chaos. The homebuyers face the prospect of losing the homes they paid deposits and signed contracts for. The financial stress and emotional toll has been immense on the five homebuyers who did not pull out of their contracts. They have spent thousands of euro in rent since 2020, not to mention storage cost and lost savings. One family from the group was evicted from their rental home earlier this year and is now living in a single bedroom with their young child. Another couple lives less than 200 yards from the Ringfort site and every time they pass it, they say they feel a mix of heartbreak and anger. Their contracts, you would guess, are legally binding. They have paid deposits and the homes are built, but these families cannot move in.",
                    "Even if these families had their deposits returned, they simply can no longer purchase houses at today's prices, which essentially leaves them homeless. One couple stated how ordinary people can do everything right and still lose. They have gone through every proper channel, kept every line of communication open and offered compromise after compromise, and still no progress has been made. The families who signed contracts for these homes are asking for accountability. I first brought this up nearly two and a half years ago. I ask the Minister of State to intervene and contact the Revenue Commissioners and his Department to step in and ensure the homebuyers' contracts are honoured after five years. Will he meet the five families affected as soon as possible? These families are close to losing everything they have worked so hard for. They need help and support from us all, and they need it now."

                    "I thank the Deputy for raising what is a very distressing situation for the homebuyers who entered into contracts and indeed paid significant deposits for the purchase of 16 homes at Ringfort development in Rathmolyon, County Meath. I have read news reports as recently as this morning about this case. My deepest sympathies go out to those families. I understand the frustration they are facing. For many of us, buying a new home is a dream. It is an aspiration for all families. The Government is committed to ensuring such aspirations can be realised. That is why we published the Government housing action plan last week, which commits to delivery of 300,000 homes to the end of 2030, including 90,000 starter home supports.",
                    "As I am sure the Deputy will understand, this matter is subject to an ongoing legal process and I understand the developer company is appointing a liquidator. Accordingly, I am constrained in what I can say on the matter. While I certainly share the understandable concerns of the Deputy and the families concerned, there are clear laws of contract and legal frameworks governing the purchase of houses that should be enforced.",
                    "I am aware State support has been drawn upon by both the homebuyers and developer concerned. I understand help to buy was used by some of the homebuyers to support the purchase, while the developer drew down loan funding from Home Building Finance Ireland to help finance the development, debt I am given to understand has been repaid. Notwithstanding the State support provided, the matter remains a private contractual and legal one between the homebuyers and the developer in question. Accordingly, it would be inappropriate for me as Minister of State or for the Government to intervene, especially when the appropriate legal processes are under way."

I visited the site in Ringfort last Friday and blocks were being delivered to complete works on the boundary wall. This site is nearly complete, which begs the question why the developer would continue to work on the site if it is going to liquidate it. Yesterday we attended a meeting with the liquidator, the developer and the homebuyers. The homebuyers left the meeting with many question unanswered. The homes they paid deposits on are built, the lights are on but five years after giving deposits, some with the help to buy scheme as the Minister of State said, the doors are still locked for the five families who just want to move into their forever homes. Residents believe this case exposes how existing company and receivership law allows directors to manipulate processes at the expense of ordinary homebuyers. I have seen developments delayed in different towns. Developers are hoping that homebuyers pull out of legally binding contracts so they can get the current market value for houses they are building, which is at an all-time high and increasing. If the price decreased in value, the developer would expect contracts to be honoured. It should be the same the other way around. I ask the Minister of State again to intervene here so these homebuyers can move into their homes. The way they are being treated is appalling. The flaws in Ireland's housing regulation and receivership system are being taken advantage of. I plead with the Minister of State to make the right decision and intervene to protect these five homebuyers and families who remain and want their contracts, legally binding agreements, honoured in the middle of a housing crisis."

                    "I raise deeply worrying and entirely unacceptable issues for apartment owners and renters who are experiencing them in my constituency of Dublin South-Central. Let me paint a picture for the Minister of State. When I visited some of these apartment blocks, I saw fire safety hazards and potential for flooding. In another apartment block, I saw water coming into people's homes. This was not from a river. They do not know where this water is coming from. It has dripped into their home so much that it is now forming mould behind cupboards that have to be taken off. It is lifting skirting boards. I have been in their homes, and they invited me in to show me what exactly was going on. They have a wonderful area outside, which could be a communal area, but because it so badly damaged by water and the lack of ability to have any remediation, they are not able to use it. After I visited, a few weeks later, part of that apartment building fell apart. The family who live underneath have twins. They are brand new babies. If it had been warm enough to be out, they could have been sitting out underneath that balcony and they would have been seriously injured or worse.",
                    "The difficulty is that they are stuck in a situation where they are not able to get this remediation because they do not seem to be able to do it. They have a sinking fund, which is sinking rapidly into things that should be fixed ordinarily. There are developers that still own parts of those apartments. They are not paying money to the owner management company. There are people who own their apartments and they have spent a lot of money on these apartments. I do not know if the Minister of State knows my constituency, but Dublin 8 is an area where properties are very expensive. These properties were bought at the height of the boom and they were incredibly expensive. They are gorgeous, but people are frightened to live there. They are at their wits' end. One of things that I remember from that meeting was that one couple said they hated to hear the sound of dripping because they knew that was when something was going to go bad. In their minds, they hear drip, drip, drip all the time. They have buckets, pans and pots trying to gather the water, but they are emptying them all the time. It is causing them absolute stress. When I met them, what should have been a wonderful place to live in was an extremely stressful place to live in.",
                    "Will the Government deliver a comprehensive and fully funded statutory remediation scheme for apartment owners and renters? According to parliamentary records, legislation to establish an apartments and duplex defects remediation scheme is being drafted. The Government has approved in principle such a scheme with the aim of covering 100% of the eligible remediation costs for purpose-built apartments and duplexes constructed between 1991 and 2013, but the scheme seems to be unimplemented. These people living in these apartments are not able to access this. I am not going to name them because that would not be fair, but I am happy to talk to the Minister of State afterwards and give him the names. It is causing them a huge amount of stress. Will the Government provide a clear and publicly published timeline for when this legislation will be passed, when the scheme will be opened and when affected residents can apply? Will the Minister of State guarantee that as part of that scheme no apartment owner or renter will be forced to shoulder the costs of the defects that they now have by ensuring that remediation costs already incurred or levied will be eligible for refund or support under the legacy defects provisions of the scheme?"

The Government fully understands and acknowledges the difficulties that homeowners and residents of many apartments and duplexes are facing and the stress that is caused when defects arise in their properties. The Government is committed to helping those whose lives have been impacted by this issue. As the Deputy is aware and mentioned, the Department is, as a matter of priority, preparing legislation to put in place a statutory remediation scheme for owners of certain apartments affected by fire safety, water ingress and structural defects. This legislation will establish supports for the remediation of these defects in purpose-built apartment buildings, including duplexes, constructed between 1991 and 2013. Given the complexity of the issues, including the significant amount of Exchequer funding that this Government has committed to assisting affected homeowners, sufficient time is required to ensure that the scheme is fit for purpose, provides value for money for taxpayers and contains appropriate oversight and governance measures.",
                    "Indeed, good progress has been made with Department officials attending a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage yesterday evening to begin the process of pre-legislative scrutiny. Pending the introduction of the statutory scheme, the interim remediation scheme has been established to provide for funding of emergency fire safety defect works to provide an acceptable level of fire safety in buildings until full remedial works can be completed. This scheme, which is being administered by the Housing Agency on a nationwide basis, is open to applications from apartment owner management companies, OMCs, via the Housing Agency's website. Given their status under the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011 and the key role they play in management of the apartment sector, OMCs have been identified from an early stage as being an essential ingredient to ensuring the efficient and effective delivery of this remediation scheme. The Housing Agency will oversee the process, ensuring OMCs receive the funding necessary to carry out these remedial works. It will work with the companies through the application process. In addition, an effective advice and information service within the agency has been established to provide support for OMCs. In principle, full funding will be provided for all eligible works necessary to achieve an acceptable level of fire safety in each building. To ensure value for money and good governance regarding Exchequer funding, appropriate terms and conditions will apply to such funding, outlined in the grant agreement."

If people are not paying in and if everyone is not in the OMC, what seems to be happening is that they are not able to access the remedial fund. When that happens, those areas are not being looked after because there is no one able to do it. What happens then for apartment blocks where the OMC is not as strong as it could be?

I will not outline the total, but one woman has paid in a lot of money to make sure that her home is safe for her children, herself and her husband. The reality is that when these apartments were built, building standards were not upheld. This is a problem of a regulation that was never enforced. We have a number of apartment blocks not only in my constituency but around the country, which now have to be sorted out because there was no enforcement. I do not know how this happened. We are supposed to have regulations for everything, and it seems to not have worked. We have fire regulations, but this water ingress is also happening. The people who live there are taxpayers. They are renters or they own their apartments, and they deserve better. I acknowledge the need for value for money, but there is no value for money for the people who live there. They are seriously stressed. I thank the Minister of State for his response. I will keep pressing on this issue because time is of the essence. People spend a lot of time in their homes. This is totally fixable. If homes are dangerous and if they are stressed in their homes, time is of the essence."

If we are to invest significant sums of taxpayers' money in remediating these properties, we have to ensure there is effective governance in place in all those complexes. The last thing we want to see is money being poured into something and for it either not to be improved to the level it needs to be or to be misused in some other way. This money, which is taxpayers' money, will be ring-fenced to improve apartments and duplexes that were impacted between 1991 and 2013. The report in 2022 estimated that up to 100,000 units could be impacted, not just in Dublin but right across the country.

Louth has stroke survivors trying to relearn how to walk and speak with no specialist community rehab team to support them. People with acquired brain injuries are being discharged from hospitals straight into a vacuum. Families are caring for loved ones with progressive neurological conditions without any structural follow-up. Patients are travelling across counties or simply giving up because the service or the medical team recommended to them does not exist. We are not talking about a luxury service; we are talking about physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, psychology and medical rehab oversight. Those are the fundamentals of recovery and these are supports that determine whether persons regain independence or lose it permanently. Right now in Louth, that recovery depends entirely on a person's postcode, a system that is failing us. In reality, for every month Louth patients wait, they lose more function. For every year the team is delayed, more function becomes permanently lost. That cost is inaction, and that is what patients are dealing with.",

We have been left behind in the north east. The HSE has confirmed year after year that it has submitted estimate bids to fund the CNRTs for the regions with nothing, including mine, and those bids have not been delivered. When I ask through parliamentary questions whether existing neurological services in Louth will be expanded or integrated, the answer is that we have to wait for the national service plan for 2026. When I ask about monitoring this, the reply is \"details to follow\"; when I ask about staff and recruitment plans, it is \"not yet available\". There is no timeline, no commitment or no clarity. It is completely unfair to the patients in County Louth and the people of County Louth that they are continuously waiting for this. We cannot leave families continuously waiting while the rest of the country moves on. There is no equity in that system. We cannot pretend that a region of nearly half a million people does not need what the HSE itself describes as essential population-based rehabilitation services.",

                    "The history of this pool is an absolute mess. In the 1980s, Lucan Community Council collected moneys for a leisure centre. People paid towards this and were promised a pool in phase 2. Unfortunately, the project went into debt with a bank loan to AIB and had to be bailed out by the council and Lucan leisure centre became owned by South Dublin County Council. People were still asking whether they could have a pool. In 2002, the council said it was sorry but the swimming pool programme was closed and we could not apply. I was a TD at the time. I put in a number of parliamentary questions and was told that we could have still applied. The council made a hames of it for the first time at that time.",
                    "Along with my colleague and friend, the late Councillor Fintan McCarthy, I was involved in the swimlucan.com campaign in 2005. We collected over 1,000 postcard petitions and an equal number of emails were sent into South Dublin County Council. Fintan was able to get a commitment from the council that it would add the Lucan swimming pool to its own programme. The response was that while the council was committed to building a pool out of its own funds, it would be remiss not to seek funding elsewhere as well. That was the story. Unfortunately, in 2006, my late friend and colleague died tragically in an accident in China. His vacant seat was taken over by my late father, Billy Gogarty, who subsequently became mayor. He was told during his term as mayor that he would be turning the sod for Lucan swimming pool. This was in 2007. Unfortunately, he died tragically of a brain tumour in 2008. His replacement, Councillor Dorothy Corrigan, in due course asked about the pool. The council stated that there were no plans for a pool at the time. Having given a commitment, they reneged on it after two people involved in the project died under tragic circumstances.",
                    "It is no surprise that, in 2014, when I came onto South Dublin County Council again, my first speech in the chamber was about the Lucan swimming pool. This time there were a number of a community individuals, including Helen Farrell and Sandra Whelan, who were interested in doing a campaign on the pool. Along with other councillors, including Liona O'Toole, Guss O'Connell and Francis Timmons, I decided to support their massive campaign to bring it back into the eyesight of the then county manager. After a number of trials and tribulations, we got it into the county development plan and the rolling three-year programme and the council committed €6.2 million towards a pool. This is where it becomes a matter of State interest because €3.8 million of that initial investment came from national sources.",
                    "The pool design was passed in 2018 and we were told that construction would commence the following year and it would be completed in 2020-21. Covid hit, obviously, there were supply chain issues and prices went up. At some stage in the period between 2020 and 2022, the council took its eye off the ball. When I was a councillor, I submitted many questions asking when the pool was going to be completed. We were told that it would happen in December 2022, in April 2023, and so on. A new architect was appointed to oversee the project a year and a half ago. That individual deserves a medal because they have been chasing a lost cause. They were trying to keep their finger on the pulse of what was happening with the contractor. The contractor was not allowing any proper oversight until recently. The contract was then terminated. The council said it cannot do a review until the project is finished but I believe a review up to the point of the contractor's termination is absolutely necessary."

Government investment in sport is essential to increase participation levels in all sports across all sectors of society. The allocation for the sports programme in budget 2026 is over €290 million, an increase of just under €60 million or 26% compared to the 2025 allocation. When the national sports policy was published in 2018, it set a commitment to double investment in sport to more than €220 million by 2027. Obviously, we are significantly ahead of that already.",
                    "With regard to the development of physical sports infrastructure, the role of the Department of Culture, Communications and Sport is to provide capital funding for such facilities, including swimming pools. The construction and day-to-day operation of swimming pools is a matter for the respective local authority in the first instance. The Department operates two capital funding programmes for sport, namely the community sports facilities fund, CSFF, and the large-scale sport infrastructure fund, LSSIF. Over €250 million was allocated to 3,048 community sports clubs and facilities in 2024 from the 2023 round of the CSFF, representing the largest ever investment in sports facilities in communities across Ireland. The LSSIF was established under the 2018 national sports policy to provide Exchequer support for larger sports facility projects, typically those requiring investments greater than the maximum available under the CSFF. A total of €297 million has been invested through the LSSIF across 68 projects. The 2018 round awarded €124 million to 33 projects, including top-ups in 2023. In November 2024, €173 million was allocated to 35 projects following record demand. An allocation of €28.9 million was made to nine swimming pool projects. In addition, the CSFF has provided allocations in excess of €5 million over the last ten years to swimming projects.",
                    "Previously, the local authority swimming pool programme, LASPP, provided grant aid towards the capital costs of new swimming pools or the refurbishment of existing pools. Fifty-two pools have been completed and just one swimming pool project, Lucan, remains in the programme. Lucan swimming pool is currently under construction. I note that South Dublin County Council handed over the dry-side facilities, including the gym, to the appointed operator on 22 July 2025. These facilities were subsequently opened to the public on 28 July 2025. In relation to the funding provided to Lucan swimming pool, the Department, as the Deputy rightly states, provided a grant aid allocation of €3.8 million from the LASPP to South Dublin County Council, which is responsible for delivery of the policy. Formal approval for the grant was provided in 2019. To date, the Department has paid out €3.2 million to South Dublin County Council for the ongoing construction works on Lucan swimming pool. South Dublin County Council has confirmed that the construction programme for Lucan leisure campus was impacted, as the Deputy said, by supply chain issues, Covid and the war in Ukraine. Since then, various other factors have contributed to project delays.",
                    "I am informed that South Dublin County Council is actively working to advance the project and ensure delivery of the facility for the people of the area. A tender process for appointing a replacement contractor is complete and a preferred bidder has been identified and notified. This step is critical to progressing the project and completing the remaining works. The newly appointed contractor will assume responsibility for co-ordinating all remaining works which will include finalising the swimming pool element of the development. Following the conclusion of the contractual arrangements, an updated project completion date will be communicated publicly. This will provide clarity and certainty to the community regarding the timeframe for opening the leisure centre and swimming pool complex."

The Minister of State mentioned the Covid issues and the restrictions on working practices, etc. The council was aware of this from an early stage but it took the word of the contractor. I have had stories told to me about electricians walking off site because they were not getting paid commensurate to the increases in costs. As they are obviously the ones who have to certify the work, this would have caused delays. What we were told by the council which could not be put into the public domain was that while that contract was live, it had to adopt a softly-softly approach because if the council had to re-tender the contract, it would massively increase costs and delay construction of the pool. Three years later, we have seen a massive increase in costs. The original pool was approximately €10 million. It was €13 million at the commencement and now it has gone up to €20 million. We have had an increase in costs that goes way above Covid and supply chain increases.",

There has been a massive clamour for proper transparency - as there has been none - from members of the public in Lucan who have been looking for this pool for years. The council has consistently refused to give any sort of information now that the contract is complete from the McLoughlins side on why it held on as long as it did. What were the factors? There could be valid factors. I would like to see them in the public domain. We cannot wait until after the pool is completed. We need this information now because it is a huge waste of public money that we need to investigate. I ask that the State would use its own resources to try and get such an inquiry going."

The governing body, Swim Ireland, is currently undertaking an analysis of the overall ownership structure of swimming pools across the country that will feed in to future projects. I assure the Deputy that this is something the Department will keep a close eye on, as we want to see this project completed and the pool opened as quickly as possible."

                    "Recently, Home and Community Care Ireland, HCCI, published its new report and witness for home and community care throughout the State. Home and Community Care Ireland is an umbrella group for home and community care providers across Ireland. Its report is based on the latest available statistics. The report makes for grim reading, with almost 5,000 people currently waiting for home care, but what is of particular concern for me is that my constituency of Clare has a waiting list of 304, which when calculated per 1,000 people of population equates to 2.386 per 1,000 or 157% of the national county average. The lowest waiting list per 1,000 of population is Dublin, with 0.076. County Clare's waiting list is more than 3,000% higher than that.",
                    "HCCI has compiled reports on waiting lists for a few years but they were based on the total number of people on the waiting list in each county. Under that measure, Cork had the highest waiting list. This is the first report that calculates the HSE waiting list as a percentage of the population of each county. Since it is the first report of its kind, we cannot even say for sure how long this problem has persisted in County Clare. More importantly, we do not know why the waiting list is so much worse in County Clare, so that is the first question that needs to be answered. What is causing the excessive waiting lists in County Clare? If the Government does not know, what does it intend to do to research the problem and find out its causes?",
                    "These 304 are not just numbers. Behind each of them is a person who has been approved by the HSE for home care hours and yet cannot avail of this vital service to keep them in their own home for longer. Without this help, people's health can deteriorate, making them more likely to need hospital care or nursing home care. They may also face difficulties in being discharged because they cannot be sent back to their own home if the home care is not available to them. A spokesperson for HCCI said that they have heard of examples of where people have died while on the waiting list, only for their families to be later offered home care for them. This must be utterly heartbreaking for family members. They must feel like their loved one was completely let down and neglected by the State in their time of need.",
                    "The HSE issued a statement to the media in response to the HCCI report. We should not be reliant on the HSE to issue statements in the wake of a report like this about the lack of services that people have to endure to try to find out what is going on. The HSE statement may have been its best guess as to why the people of County Clare have been so neglected but a number of its assertions simply do not add up. It states that the mid-west has an ageing population and that is a contributing factor. However, other counties with higher age profiles have lower waiting lists. The Central Statistics Office gives a ratio for the number of people over 65 years of age to those under 65 in each county. County Leitrim, for example, has an age ratio of 28.4, according to the latest census data compared to a ratio of 25.1 for Clare, yet its waiting list is 1.254 and ours is 2.386. Let me be absolutely clear: the waiting list in Leitrim is far from acceptable. No one should have to wait for the care services they need.",
                    "The HSE's statement also implied that County Clare is a rural county but so is County Kerry. It has a waiting list of 0.676 per 100,000 compared to our 2.386, so ours is more than three times the waiting list of Kerry, even though both counties are rural.",
                    "The HSE is responsible for managing the waiting lists and for managing decisions to allocate home care to people in the first place, yet it seems it is not able to adequately account for the large difference between the waiting lists in each county. Even if we in County Clare does have a higher ageing population than anywhere else, and even if we have a more dispersed rural population than anywhere else, as the HSE seems to assert, it is still the job of the Government to ensure that Irish citizens have proper, full and prompt access to appropriate home care when they require it. Every Government has had access to census data for years, which was supposed to be used to plan for future needs, so why do we find ourselves in this unacceptable situation?"

It is an increase of nearly €122 million on the previous year and an increase of over 70% when compared to the 2020 budget of €487 million. We are on track to exceed the target of 24 million home support hours, excluding complex home support, for this year.

                    "It is a pity the Minister for Health is not here because, unfortunately, the Minister of State has been left to read out a response which indicates that he has not even heard what I have been saying. The answer he has read suggests that the Department has exceeded targets but we are not seeing that in County Clare. The answer does not tell us what we want to hear. While I thank HCCI for this report, which clearly identifies the problem of waiting lists for home care in various counties, we should not have to rely on a report to tell us what we should be informed of by the HSE. It is the responsibility of the Government and the HSE to bring forward solutions for this, but I am not hearing solutions. The Minister of State is saying that there are increases, but they are not being seen in County Clare. These solutions have to be rooted in a clear understanding of the sources of the problems. It is deeply concerning that the HSE cannot clearly identify the causes of the current excessive waiting times in County Clare. The suggestion that County Clare has longer waiting times because it is a rural county does not hold up when other rural counties do not have the same level of waiting lists we have. The idea that it is caused by an ageing population overlooks the fact that other counties with ageing populations have shorter waiting lists than ours. This seems to be another case of postcode lottery in terms of services. We in County Clare have inadequate services and the agencies responsible do not seem to know why.",
                    "The people of County Clare have a right to feel abandoned by the Government. The HCCI stated in its report that it relies on parliamentary questions to get access to statistics and data relating to waiting lists. We need to see transparent reporting from the HSE. Will the Government instruct the HSE to compile and report on waiting lists regularly in the same way it reports on other matters? If so, when will it do so? If not, why not? This report should serve as a wake-up call. People are being left to wait and suffer in silence and that is not acceptable. Ours is a modern society in the 21st century. This dereliction of duty by the Government cannot continue. The Government and the HSE need to formulate a plan to introduce protocols for the capturing, analysing and publicising of data related to what is clearly an inadequate home care service."

Nonetheless, I acknowledge the points the Deputy has raised. The Minister of State with responsibility for older persons and housing, Deputy O'Donnell, is committed to ensuring that where there are gaps in provision, including in County Clare as the Deputy has pointed out, they will be addressed through the national service plan which the HSE will bring forward. There is no question that areas of rural Ireland should not be disadvantaged in terms of home support - or any other service for that matter - that is provided by the State. Where there are disproportionate waiting lists in certain parts of the country, we are committed to addressing that through the HSE service plan, which the HSE is responsible for bringing forward. It is the Government's responsibility to ensure the funding is put in place and it is the HSE's responsibility to ensure that adequate provision is provided across the country to ensure people can remain in their homes, as is their requirement, and to ensure we free up capacity within acute settings as well. I will take the points the Deputy has made back to the Minister for Health."

                "I am sharing with Deputies Murphy and Coppinger. This Government speaks out of both sides of its mouth when it comes to the issue of Palestine. In one breath it states it stands with the people of Palestine against the crimes that Israel inflicts on them and promises sanctions while in the other breath it reassures its friends in the White House that it is going to do nothing at all, and the consequence of that is that despite promises for nearly ten years on the occupied territories Bill, it still has not passed it. It is bad enough that since 2018 the Government has refused to pass this Bill to impose sanctions on Israel for the illegal settlements in the West Bank but then after two years of a genocidal massacre, the Government still refuses to pass it, having made solemn promises in the recent general election that it would pass it, and is seeking to dilute it by leaving out services. It is an absolute disgrace. There is simply no justification for it. I hope the fact that the new Minister is not here is not a sign of a disrespectful attitude towards this Bill and towards taking the issue seriously.",
                "As our motion sets out, there are simply no excuses left for this Government. Politically the Government promised the Irish people it would pass the occupied territories Bill, with no mention of leaving services out or anything. The Government made a promise and it should keep that promise. The joint Oireachtas committee, which includes Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael members, has recommended the occupied territories Bill be passed and the Government got clear legal advice from the Attorney General to the joint Oireachtas committee that there is no difficulty legally with including services in the occupied territories Bill and the ban on the importation of goods from the occupied territories. The Government has stated that the International Court of Justice advisory opinion is an authoritative statement on international law and that it requires all EU member states to prevent the importation of goods from occupied territories but, of course, this Government still refuses to do it, even when other governments in Europe have now done it. Slovenia, Spain and The Netherlands have all now passed Bills imposing sanctions on Israel in terms of the occupied territories. Yet, this Government that I do not know how many times I have heard come in here and claim it is the most pro-Palestinian voice in the EU still refuses to do so.",
                "Of course, the double standards and contrast with what we heard last night in the statements on Ukraine is so blatant it is really outrageous. Rightly, the Government condemned Vladimir Putin for an imperialist invasion of Ukraine. What was the response of this Government to that invasion? It was instantaneous sanctions and 19 rounds of sanctions imposed on Putin for what is and was a bloody, brutal and unjustifiable invasion in Ukraine. However, in the case of Palestine, after two years of a genocidal massacre, 17 years of a criminal siege on Gaza, decades of ethnic cleansing, 700,000 illegal settlements on the West Bank, an apartheid system, denial of the right to return and ethnic cleansing on an ongoing basis and there is not a single sanction. It is shameful. Stop dancing to the tune of Donald Trump and the White House; the enablers of the genocide in Palestine. Do what was promised to the Irish people. Do what is right for the Palestinians and for humanity.",
                "If the Government has any respect for international law and for human rights, it must pass the occupied territories Bill, which, by the way, is only the minimal sanction that should be imposed on this regime. Let us be clear: all the occupied territories Bill does is impose a ban on the importation of goods from the illegal settlements. In our view - and I will be absolutely clear about this- we should be going a lot further than that. There should be a complete boycott, divestment, and sanctions from this criminal regime. A regime that is capable of genocide has no place in the civilised world. This Bill does not even address the issue of the right to return or the apartheid system and the criminal siege of Gaza. It is a minimal sanction in line with the Government's international legal obligations. Do what you said you would do: pass this Bill and finally impose sanctions on this criminal regime."

                "Two days ago, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 2803, a resolution endorsing the so-called Trump peace plan - a peace plan that, disgracefully, was welcomed by the Irish Government. We will probably hear it welcomed again today. It makes the saying from Tacitus, \"they make a desert and call it peace,\" the most appropriate it has ever been because after two years of genocide, after killing at least 66,000 people, over 20,000 children, after imposing famine, after mowing people down while queuing for food, after destroying the majority of buildings, the hospitals, the schools, the universities, the homes in Gaza, now a peace is declared but it is no peace at all. It is a continued colonial carve-up that is remarkable only for how naked it is.",
                "The UN resolution explicitly endorses the so-called \"board of peace\" as a \"transitional administration\". This is a board to be chaired by Donald Trump. The only other member we know who is going to be on it is Tony Blair, a war criminal, but presumably he will be joined by a series of other war criminals and these people are to be imposed, without vote and without any consultation with the Palestinian people, as new colonial viceroys on the people of Gaza.",
                "What Trump plans to do there is set out in his own Trump plan. It was set out in that disgusting video about the Trump-Riviera plan for Gaza and then, in slightly more polite terms, it is in the peace plan as a \"Trump economic development plan\" and \"a special economic zone\". There is going to be an army of occupation called the international stabilisation force answerable, not to the Palestinian people, but to the viceroys on the board of peace. What is absent from the UN resolution and what is absent from the peace plan is the Palestinian people; the Palestinian people's right to self-defence, their right to determine their own government and their right to self-determination.",
                "However, the counterpart to the genocide we saw openly unfolding for two years in Gaza, backed by western imperialism, armed by western imperialism, supported by western imperialism, the US, Germany, Britain, the EU, is the expansion of settlements in the West Bank and in Jerusalem.",
                "This year, 30,000 settlement units have been approved by the Israeli Government. The term \"settlements\" does not capture what is happening. Palestinian people are being violently removed from their land. Their land is being stolen from them today and taken by these Israeli settlers. Later on, the Israeli Government authorises and recognises this and more Palestinian land is stolen. At the time of the Oslo Accords, there were 250,000 illegal Israeli settlers. When Senator Frances Black first introduced this Bill, there were 600,000 such settlers and today there are 750,000 of them. The latest settlement is the so-called E1, which divides the West Bank in two, further isolating Palestinians in Jerusalem. It is all about a logic of extermination of the Palestinian people. That is what the genocide and the settlements are about.",
                "This motion is an extremely modest proposal, as Deputy Boyd Barrett has outlined. It is in line with international law. The International Court of Justice is clear that states are under an obligation to abstain from entering into economic or trade dealings and to prevent trade or investment relations with the settlements. There is no mention just of goods there. International law is very clear. It is also in line with the strong recommendation of the Oireachtas foreign affairs committee, which strongly recommended \"progressing the Bill\" and that the prohibition on imports \"should be extended to include trade in services\". It is line with the promises made by Simon Harris and Micheál Martin over a year ago during the general election debate.",
                "This motion is extremely minimal in what it asks, as is the Bill. Our motion could not be simpler or clearer, with only two very simple asks. One is that the Bill be implemented in full before Christmas and the other is that services be included. We have a Government that says it is not going to oppose this motion, so this will be the position of the Dáil after this debate. However, in the same breath as saying that it is not going to oppose the motion, the Government is saying that it is not going to guarantee that it will implement it before Christmas and that it has not yet decided if it is going to include services. It is a complete joke. The Government makes a farce of this place by saying that the Dáil can pass whatever it wants, that it will allow a simple two-ask motion to pass, but it will not give any commitment to actually implement it. That is the height of cynicism. What is it about? It is about cowardice. The Government does not want to face the prospect of TDs who support this Government voting against it. It does not want to see Members who supported the call at the foreign affairs committee to include services being pressured to vote against including services now. It does not want to reveal its real position to the Irish people, which is that it does not want to include services. It wants to water this legislation down. That is the truth of its position, which is one of extreme moral cowardice and extreme cynicism.",
                "I will now address both the so-called good reasons put forward by the Government to explain why, in reality, it wants to back away from this, as well as the real reasons. One of the good reasons put forward by Simon Harris on a number of occasions is that he wants to include services but is afraid that there might be legal issues with it. There is no basis to that whatsoever. First, there is the position of the International Court of Justice, upon which the whole change of Government position was based, which makes no distinction between goods and services. That is the fundamental point in terms of international law. Second, there is now talk of Attorney General advice. This is the most blatant retroactive getting of advice to suit a political position. The Attorney General already gave advice on this and made no mention of any problem in terms of services. This is simply an attempt to find legal cover for the political retreat that the Government wants to engage in.",
                "A second argument is that we do not want to be alone, but we are going so slowly, under public pressure, that we are no longer alone. Slovenia has already moved to ban imports by immediate government decision. In Belgium, there is a government announcement in relation to the occupied territories and Spain has moved on the importation of goods, as has the Netherlands. We are certainly no longer alone. The other argument that is now advanced, which is absolutely threadbare, is the idea that this will be unimplementable. How could we possibly do this in terms of services? The problem the Government has there is that it already does it in terms of services in Russia. The Government has implemented full sanctions and a ban on the import and export of goods and services with Russia, and IBEC accepted at a meeting of the foreign affairs committee that businesses had complied with that ban.",
                "Now I come to the real reason for the Government's cowardice on this issue, which is pressure from US imperialism, lobbying from the US Chamber of Commerce and pressure from the US ambassador. It is very blatant that this is the case. There is an excellent new report from Uplift, called The Neutrality Files, which explains this bit by bit. Uplift's summary of the situation is that the Government's public justifications for not passing the occupied territories Bill, namely, EU law and costs, were a smokescreen for the real reason, which is capitulation to economic pressure from the US activated on behalf of Israel. In October 2025, Reuters broke a story that the Bill would be diluted as a direct result of corporate pressure. Later in October, speaking to the Dáil, the Taoiseach, Deputy Micheál Martin, signalled that the Bill would go ahead without services. That is the truth. In October 2024, the US ambassador to Ireland, Ms Claire Cronin, warned of \"consequences\" for US companies in Ireland if the Bill proceeded. Hours later, the then Tánaiste, Micheál Martin, announced that the Bill would be shelved for review. We know that back in 2019 the then Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, in a confidential call quoted in leaked Israeli documents, confirmed that the Irish Government would be using a procedure known as a money message to seek to block the progress of the draft Irish legislation. That is all this is and the only thing that can force this Government to act is massive public pressure from below. That is why I will be on the streets with lots of others tonight at 5.30 p.m outside the Dáil."

                "If passed, Ireland and her Parliament will be sending a strong message, that it condemns the occupation of territories deemed illegal under international law. This Bill, at its most basic, is about upholding international law. It applies to illegal occupations anywhere in the world and not just to Israel and Palestine.",
                "It was a member of the Minister of State's party, Deputy Niall Collins, who said that in this House in 2019. What has changed? What has happened in the intervening years is that there has been a genocide. Gaza has been reduced not to rubble or ruins but to ashes. Israel has carried out that genocide. The Irish Government says that it recognises the genocide. The Government was in here in 2019 saying \"rah, rah, rah\" but now it is sheepishly pulling back from its own Bill. It is a pity that the new Minister for foreign affairs is not here to listen to this debate. I cannot think of too many issues that are more pressing and that should be on her agenda right now. Again, this is another insult to the Dáil.",
                "I issue a content warning for anybody listening, but soldiers accused of sexually assaulting handcuffed Palestinian detainees have received standing ovations in court in Israel. The stories that we have heard since the release of the Palestinian hostages have made our skin crawl. I am in a WhatsApp group called D15 with Palestine that has many local Palestinian members. They share videos that they get from within Palestine but we could not even post half of them on our social media because it would be too distressing.",
                "We have heard a lot of guff in recent days, and I heard it again this morning as I drove in here, about the centre and how important that is to the Government. The centre is pro-genocide and pro-imperialism. Let us cut the crap here about the centre. The EU is not just trading with Israel; it is giving it favourable terms of trade. That is the centre. The centre is imperialism, now carving up Gaza. The Irish people have done a lot but the Irish Government has done absolutely nothing but talk. By the way, as well as reports on the treatment of detainees, we have seen reports of a shoot-to-kill policy but I want to talk about public opinion and why the Government is so against what the Irish people want. As my colleagues have said, Ireland has compromised its own sovereignty due to our FDI model. Approximately 75% of corporation tax comes from American multinationals and 69% of FDI is US based.",
                "It has distorted our economy and many things relating to how we measure our success. It has created a deep structural link to Israel. I wondered why Ireland is the second largest trader with Israel. Lo and behold, when it is broken down, it is because Intel is here. According to a report into our FDI model and how it supports genocide, Intel had bespoke infrastructure created for it through investment from our Government. The Government's dependence on an economic model of capitalism in Ireland means that we are now not able to support any measures against genocide.",
                "Ireland has become a financial offshoring base through the creation of the IFSC. It is a platform for companies, in particular US companies, to filter operations and profits through Ireland rather than Ireland creating its own industry. I do not have time to develop this point, but I will give some examples. The Azure cloud platform, which carries out mass surveillance of Palestinian mobile phones, came from data centres in Ireland run by Microsoft, as well as other countries. Project Nimbus, a €1.2 billion contract with Amazon and Israel, was possible because the data centres the Government loves so much create and hold that data here. The real reason for not passing the occupied territories Bill is not legal advice. Rather, it is the Government's cowardice and industrial policy, along with the Israeli lobbying that has been happening. This is about contagion. Israel does not want any government taking any action that will send a message across the world regarding what other governments could do. It is shameful."

We will have peace and two states in the region. The adoption of a resolution on Gaza by the UN Security Council is an important step towards implementation of the peace plan. The text provides clarity on how the next stages of the plan will be taken forward, including the creation of an international stabilisation force. The Security Council has the international authority to make these decisions and I am glad it has done that.

                "Much more needs to be done to scale up delivery of humanitarian aid into Gaza. The Opposition is not wrong. The people of Gaza have endured unimaginable suffering. We all see that every day. We need all crossings into Gaza fully opened for essential humanitarian aid. Efforts must advance to return essential services, provide for early recovery needs, including the basics of food, water, sanitation, shelter and heating, as well as medical needs and schooling for children.",

I remain extremely concerned by recent and ongoing developments across the West Bank, where Israeli military operations have displaced at least 40,000 people since January and caused widespread destruction of civilian infrastructure and homes. The scale, speed and severity of displacement and demolitions is unprecedented. The number of settlement plans and tenders advanced by Israel in 2023 and 2024 represents a 250% increase over the previous seven-year period.",
                "At least 849 obstacles that permanently or intermittently restrict the movement of 3.3 million Palestinians are currently installed across the West Bank. The decision to approve plans for settlement construction in the E1 area is unacceptable and a violation of international law, and on that there is broad consensus. The Israeli Government must stop settlement construction in line with UN Security Council Resolution 2334.",
                "Ireland remains deeply concerned by the increasing instances of extremist settler violence and illegal settlement construction, which continue within an environment of impunity, restricting life for Palestinians across the West Bank. It is wrong. The olive harvest this year has been marred by the highest level of settler violence recorded over the past five years. Over 1,000 Palestinians have been killed in the West Bank since 7 October 2023. This figure represents 43% of all Palestinians killed in the West Bank in the past 20 years.",

The Minister, Deputy Entee, will raise these concerns at a meeting tomorrow of EU foreign ministers in Brussels.",

The Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade held a number of hearings on the general scheme and received submissions representing a range of views and perspectives. The committee published its report on the Bill. Work to analyse the report and its recommendations is well under way. There are quite a lot of recommendations to the Government as to what we need to do to analyse, in particular, the potential implications of the Bill. That was agreed by all parties at the committee. The Department is finalising the regulatory impact assessment, which will be available on the Department’s website when completed. The next steps in the process, including the timeline for the progress of the Bill, are being considered by the Government.",
                "The main purpose of the Bill is to prohibit the importation of goods into the State from Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem. The programme for Government commits to prohibiting imports of goods. The general scheme, which the committee examined, does not prohibit trade in services with natural or legal persons located in Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory.",
                "We have said we have no policy issue regarding the inclusion of services, but the Bill must be legally robust and withstand challenge. Similarly, the question of implementation must be carefully considered. The trade in services is considerably more complex than goods and there remains considerable legal uncertainty as to whether the inclusion of services is permissible under EU law. We know for certain that the inclusion of goods is permissible under EU law. We need legal clarity on the point on services. We must take into account practical issues with regard to implementation should services be included in the scope of the Bill.",
                "It remains the Government’s preference that collective action would be taken at EU level and Ireland continues to support and advocate for this. In this context, we have welcomed the announcements, as mentioned by Deputies, from the Dutch, Spanish, Slovenian and Belgian Governments, and I have discussed this with many of their ministers. By and large, the discussions relate to goods they have banned from illegal Israeli settlements. The Government has said repeatedly that we are committed to passing the Bill. Work is advancing across a number of strands at official level, as well as continued engagement at EU level - this would be much stronger if done at EU level - with like-minded partners.",
                "Regarding the wider issue of EU trade with Israel in the context of the EU-Israel association agreement, which has been mentioned, the European Commission put forward proposals in September that included the suspension of the trade elements of that agreement. Notwithstanding the positive and welcome recent developments with regard to a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza, Ireland has made clear at every opportunity our view that the EU must keep on the table the package of measures proposed by the Commission in response to Israeli human rights and other breaches.",
                "In her State of the Union address, the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, was clear on the rationale for tabling the package of proposals, which remains valid. The primary focus at EU level now is ensuring the success of the ceasefire and peace deal and making a contribution to international efforts in this regard.",
                "We do need to give peace a chance to succeed.",
                "We also must address the humanitarian situation on the ground in Gaza, which remains no less urgent. Turning the tide on famine is likely to take a long time. More than 54,000 children are acutely malnourished and face increased risk of death if untreated. Infrastructure is in ruins, with over 80% of the Gaza Strip destroyed. Access to water, healthcare and shelter remains completely inadequate. Diseases are rife. Without urgent improvements and action, more people will die from preventable causes.",
                "Despite improvements, the supply of humanitarian aid remains insufficient. The immediate focus must be on flooding humanitarian aid into and throughout Gaza. It is unacceptable that the majority of crossings into the Gaza Strip remain closed and that arbitrary restrictions continue to hinder the flow of humanitarian aid. With winter fast approaching, the vulnerability of already disenfranchised Palestinians living in these unstable and dangerous conditions grows ever more acute.",
                "We have all seen the images Members have spoken about, including of people struggling to keep dry in rain-flooded tents in Gaza in recent days. In light of these devastating circumstances, Ireland welcomes the recent advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice, which affirms that Israel must uphold its responsibilities as the \"occupying power\" by ensuring aid can flow freely, and by respecting and protecting the rights of the UN and other humanitarian agencies and their workers. We welcome that the 20-point plan expressly states that aid should be provided, without interference, through the UN and its agencies and other international institutions not associated with either party to the conflict.",
                "International collaboration and the multilateral system have never been more important as we work to implement the next phase of the peace deal and look toward new horizons for peace in Israel and Palestine. Only through upholding principles of collective engagement, dialogue, respect for international law, and through the steadfast support of the United Nations and its bodies - and the European Union using the leverage it has as well - can we advance efforts toward a just, lasting and viable two-state solution that ensures dignity and security for both Palestinians and Israelis alike."

The Palestinians have been abandoned and left behind. There would have been absolute uproar. There may have been a reduction in violence but hundreds of people have been killed by Israel since the ceasefire came into effect on 10 October and even more have been injured. According to satellite images reviewed by the BBC, Israel has destroyed more than 1,500 buildings in Gaza. Photos show entire neighbourhoods controlled by the IDF have been levelled in less than a month. We have only learned this through satellite images - God knows what is actually happening on the ground because it is extremely difficult to get reliable information because of the number of journalists who have been killed. Israel has killed 232 journalists in Gaza. On average that is 13 per month. This is the deadliest conflict for media workers ever recorded. More journalists have been killed in Gaza than in both world wars. That should be the cause of absolute outrage but it is not.",

We sat and allowed this conflict to escalate for seven years. We are meant to be doing something as a country but we have done very little. The Government is to blame for that.",

Even since then we have not used our voice to condemn the role America and Europe have played in this and their actions. We recognised the State of Palestine but only after others did it. We should have been the first. We do recognise the State of Palestine. There is nothing noble about these people having been made to suffer and the horrors they have gone through over the past few years.",

We have seen families wiped out and we have done nothing about it. Israel must be held accountable for its actions and continuing violations. Passing the occupied territories Bill would send an important message that we will not stand by and allow genocide to be normalised. We must act today and every day. History will judge us on what we have done.",

Genocide is genocide and the Irish Government is afraid to say it. Israel is complicit in genocide. It is ridiculous that we sit here and have not passed the occupied territories Bill."

In July 2024, Israel announced the biggest seizure of Palestinian land in three decades declaring 12.7 sq. km in the Jordan Valley to be state property. Settler violence is an ongoing threat to Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Campaigns of harassment continue daily. In 2021, the United Nations Human Rights Council reported that more that more than 400 incidents of violence had occurred.

The State of Israel must be held accountable for genocide and for the illegal occupation of Palestinian lands. Ireland, because of its colonial occupation, our genocidal famine and settler occupation, is uniquely placed to lead that accountability. Almost eight years after the introduction of the Bill, now supported by the Attorney General, the Oireachtas joint committee, by promises in the general election campaign and by the introduction of similar bills in other European countries, it is time that this country introduced and passed the Bill.

I am pleased to speak in favour of it but I am absolutely dismayed to find myself a year after a general election, where the occupied territories Bill was a key part of the national conversation, to be still discussing the need to pass the OTB. Both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael made commitments to enact the Bill during the election campaign, which was a significant change from their previous views, and a promise to the electorate that they would not do anything to block the progression of the Bill anymore. Those changes came about in light of the opinion of the International Court of Justice, which gave the Government a much stronger legal footing to enact the Bill. There were previous legal concerns about the ability of the Bill to withstand challenges in the European courts but the ICJ opinion addressed those concerns. Indeed, it went further. The court noted that we are obliged to take steps to prevent trade or investment relations that insist in the maintenance of the illegal situation created by Israel.",

Neither the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste have ever been able to convincingly explain to the Irish public why they believe services need to be omitted. The Tánaiste told us he had received legal advice but, as someone who received the same legal advice from the Attorney General in the summer of last year, I can say there was absolutely no reference within it to a need to make a distinction between goods and services. It was a 23-page letter that went into great detail about the issues the Attorney General had with the Bill but, in 23 pages, there was not one reference to a need to make a distinction between goods and services.",
                "What has happened since then? The Dáil has continued to raise pressure on this issue. In February, we debated a motion on the topic. There were statements on Gaza in May, July and October. We now have a recommendation from the foreign affairs committee to progress the Bill. Clearly and importantly, it recommends that we progress the Bill while including services. Despite this, we still have no occupied territories Bill enacted. Let this be the last time we have to bring forward a motion to discuss what the Government is doing. We have a new Minister for foreign affairs. I wish her well in her role. She has said this will be a top issue for her. There can be no question but that an occupied territories Bill that is passed without the inclusion of services is not what the Irish people want nor is it what the majority in this House wants. Most importantly, it will not meet the legal obligations of Ireland and other member states under international law, which were set out clearly by the International Court of Justice. We need to pass this Bill and it must include services."

That equates to about 10% of the number of people killed in the entire Irish War of Independence. The number of people being killed in Gaza every day is still enormous. There has been a lot of discussion about this ceasefire, this deal and so on. I certainly welcome any progress towards peace. I welcome the fact that progress is being made in that direction.

It is a fragile moment for the Palestinian people, their ability to have a state of their own and their right to self-determination. A lot of what is happening and a lot of what is being talked about only further highlights the needs for the occupied territories Bill and for pressure to be put on Israel and its allies to respect the rights of the Palestinian people. I refer to their right to life and to decent living conditions in the first instance, but I also refer to their right to an independent state. That is being undermined every day. Yet again, it comes back to the point that there is no accountability for Israel and no consequences for its actions. Every day, we see the Israeli state being more and more directed towards encroachment by means of the establishment of settlements, which is accelerating. Now we are even seeing Israel looking at some sort of erasure of Gaza or a reduction in its size. Statements in the Knesset suggest there may be settlements there in the future. All the while, Israel is undermining the potential future of the Palestinian state.",

I also felt there was a clear direction in terms of the occupied territories Bill but we have been talking about it for seven years at this stage. This Bill has been before these Houses for seven years. Elections happen, promises are made and then there is a change of heart. After the election, this Government seemed unable to decide whether it wanted to water down the Bill or to undertake a slow bicycle race in relation to it. Instead, it seems to have decided to do both. It is both watering it down and not progressing the legislation it has been talking about. It is unacceptable.",
                "With regard to the situation on the ground, Médecins sans Frontières provided a briefing in the audiovisual room. A phrase used by a medical professional who had been in Gaza - I am not sure whether he was a doctor or a nurse - has stayed with me. He was not even trying to be poetic or anything like that but he said there is no colour in Gaza and that everything is grey. He was talking about the fact, which has been referred to here, that 80% of the Gaza area is rubble. There is nothing left. The ability of those people to put their lives together again requires the international community to keep the pressure on and not to look away from the situation, and that includes Ireland. We are not overstating the influence of Ireland. We are not an enormous state but we use what leverage we have. This is one of those pieces. The fact that this legislation was being debated here put the matter on the table at EU level, including in Slovenia and Spain, which are now going ahead of us.",
                "I will come back to the legal question. I have never received a clear answer on this. I do not believe there is one. I think this is a political decision. The Government has told us that, because of the International Court of Justice decision, we can now, on the basis of a public policy exemption, institute a ban on goods. The sanctions and bans on goods and services imposed on Russia after the appalling and illegal invasion of Ukraine were undertaken on that same basis. If the public policy exemption for goods and services in the instance of Russia can be used, why is it only applicable to goods in relation to Palestine? There is no clear answer to that. It is a political decision. I inform the Minister of State and the new Minister and we will keep the pressure on because the correct political and moral decision is not to look away but to continue to use Ireland's influence in whatever ways we can to stop what is happening in Gaza and to deliver a true and meaningful peace and a political solution."

Now we have a Taoiseach who is saying it is not implementable. Shame on the Government. Its members gave their word to the people of Ireland, but even more importantly to the people of Palestine, Gaza and the West Bank, that we would lead the way in enacting the occupied territories Bill and that we would say to the world and to Israel in particular we will not stand idly by and we will do everything we can as a Government, a people and a nation to highlight the genocide that is going on.",

A young lad named Mohammed got one of the blue schoolbags from UNICEF and was probably delighted. He was out playing with his friends and he was shot. The bullet passed from hip to hip, so he had no chance. He was running to his grandmother’s for safety. This Bill will not stop that, but for Mohammed and all his friends, it will send a message that we will not stand idly by and we will be the voice for the Palestinian people when the world will not be."

Along with Ukraine, this is the only show in town from a foreign affairs point of view. This issue is the only issue that has had pre-legislative scrutiny through the foreign affairs committee, on which I am privileged enough to sit. This committee agreed that it:",

                "It was not just Opposition members of that committee who agreed this. Other ordinary Members of this House came in and contributed. Deputy Gibney came in and contributed a number of times in the pre-legislative scrutiny, as did members of the proposing groups. Members of Government on that committee agreed with the unanimous decision that services should be included. That was in the warm months of summer. We are now in the cold weeks of November. The previous Minister for foreign affairs, the Tánaiste, Deputy Harris, who in that seat during the Global Sumud Flotilla debate, committed to having the next Stage of the occupied territories Bill in this Chamber before the end of November. It is on the Dáil record. He said the end of November. It is 19 November now. Those on the business committee get indicative business for the rest of the month - Deputy Boyd Barrett will attest to this - and there is no sign of it. Another promise has been broken.",
                "We are a year on from the election, when the Government went door to door and said that the Bill was a priority and would be passed. What has changed? First, the Government won the election so it does not have to live up to its promises. Second, we have seen an increase in pressure from mainly American lawmakers. We know the Taoiseach received a letter from Washington from 23 lawmakers and we have seen Lindsey Graham threaten Ireland consistently. Why are we marching to their tune? These 24 lawmakers comprise 5% of all of Congress. To put it in perspective, it is less than the proportion of Government support in this House coming from the Lowry group. These lawmakers from America seem to have a disproportionate impact on this issue, compared with that group. We interrogated the threats to the Irish economy through the pre-legislative scrutiny. We asked IBEC if anyone had come to it to say they were going to pull out of Ireland or were not going to increase jobs in Ireland. It could not answer. We did not just take IBEC's word for it. We had the American Chamber of Commerce in before the committee not two weeks ago. We asked the same question. We asked if any company had come to the American Chamber of Commerce and said it was going to pull out of Ireland. The answer was \"No\". We asked if any company had said it would not grow in Ireland. The answer was \"No\". All it could refer to was this mythical, vague \"reputational damage\".",
                "Ireland's reputation is being increased and improved by the fact that we in opposition, starting with Senator Frances Black all those years ago, are pushing this Bill. The Government, for a moment, had a chance to continue to push that reputation and improve it. It is sacrificing that now on foot of fear and pressure from the United States. It is absolutely disgraceful. The Government says it is a Government of delivery. It should prove it. It should deliver this Bill. The Bill has already gone through pre-legislative scrutiny. We have done that work months ago. We have done our part; we are asking the Government to follow through. We believe this Bill will not be in before Christmas. If that happens, it will be 100% down to the Government. If the new Minister for foreign affairs is starting as she means to go on by not turning up to this debate and by not showing this one issue the respect, interest and import it deserves, it says everything about the Government and how it feels about the Palestinian people and the people of Gaza."

                "This is a moral test for us. In many respects, it echoes our own history. The occupied territories Bill has sat idle for about eight years now and in that time the situation in Palestine has spiralled into catastrophe. Over 67,000 lives have been lost in Gaza in recent years, with hundreds of thousands of illegal settlers entrenched in the West Bank. It is not a distant tragedy or anything like it. It is genocide unfolding before our eyes on a day-to-day basis. We know all about the fight against colonialism, yet as a parliament and as a nation, we hesitate. How much longer will we stand by and hesitate?",
                "The occupied territories Bill is clear. It bans trade with illegal settlements. Goods and services produced on stolen lands should never enter Irish markets because that type of trade sustains the injustice that is happening daily in Palestine. Every euro spent on settlements goods helps to entrench an occupation that has been condemned by the International Court of Justice. The ICJ ruling in July 2024 was unequivocal. It stated that an end must be brought to all economic dealings that maintain this unlawful situation. Do we respect international law or do we ignore it when it is inconvenient? We have walked this road before. In the 1980s, we were the first western country, as has already been stated, to ban imports from apartheid South Africa. We did it because we believed no Irish hand should profit from oppression. That decision inspired others and helped to dismantle a system of racial tyranny. Today, we face that same question. Will we act now as we did then or will we betray our own history of courage? Apartheid in South Africa was propped up by trade and investment. So, too, is the occupation of Palestine. When Ireland cut ties with apartheid goods, we sent a message that resonated across the globe: injustice will not be rewarded. Why should this be any different? Why should Ireland shirk away from the very principles that once made us very proud to be Irish?",
                "Our solidarity with Palestine is not an abstract thing; it is rooted in our shared experience. We know what it means to live under foreign rule and to see land confiscated, culture suppressed and communities shattered. From the centuries of British domination to the Famine that killed over 1 million of our people, oppression is etched in our national memory. We remember the Black and Tans terrorising our towns and we know that the same forces later exported their brutality to Palestine under the British mandate. The same empire that partitioned our island also partitioned theirs. How can we, of all people, of all nations, turn away from a people enduring what we once endured? Arthur Balfour, who signed the infamous declaration that paved the way for Palestinian dispossession, was the same man, as Chief Secretary for Ireland, who crushed Irish nationalism.",
                "Our histories are intertwined. When we look at Gaza and the West Bank, we see echoes of our own struggle for freedom. If we do not act, who will? When Nelson Mandela visited Ireland after his release, he praised the courage of ordinary Irish workers who stood against apartheid during the Dunnes Stores strike. He said their actions demonstrated to South Africans that ordinary people far away from the crucible of apartheid cared about their freedom. He said the solidarity of Irish workers helped him to endure prison. Ireland's stand mattered then and it matters now. Will we honour that legacy or let it fade into history?",
                "Some say this Bill is symbolic. Yes, it is symbolic but symbols matter. They ignite change. Do we want to be leaders or do we want to be laggards? The public has spoken, with 74% of Irish people supporting the Bill. Civil society, churches, trade unions and human rights groups have called for its enactment. Demonstrations outside this building almost daily demand action. Yet, the Government delays, waters down and hides behind legal smokescreens, even after EU law experts confirmed Ireland can pass the Bill without breaching EU rules. To whom are we listening? Are we listening to the Irish people or to foreign lobbyists?",
                "History is watching us. Future generations will ask what Ireland did when genocide unfolded in Gaza and illegal settlements spread across the West Bank. Did we speak or did we act? We absolutely should pass the occupied territories Bill in full, with application to goods and services, before Christmas. There must be no more delays or excuses. Ireland must lead as it did previously and show the world that our principles are not for sale. Let us be the nation that stands for justice. Let us be the people who say Ireland will not profit from occupation, we will not be complicit in apartheid and we will act now."

I also thank the people in the Gallery - the activists who continue, on a daily basis across this country, to campaign in solidarity with the people of Palestine.

On 19 November 2025, nearly a year into my role as a TD, I cannot believe I must articulate the need to fulfil those commitments. Both Government parties were clear on their absolute and unwavering commitment to act and their recognition of the sentiment of our people that this must be done. Yet, the Government has continued to prevaricate, to step into circular arguments about the Bill being symbolic and that it will make no difference and to point to people over there doing things one way and say we cannot do anything different. It is a simple enforcement of international law to pass the occupied territories Bill and prevent the State from trading with a state that is occupying another. These are the simple facts and I am trying to use simple language to move us away from the circular arguments and verbal dances the Government has created.",
                "Its two main arguments do not stack up. The Government says the Bill is impossible to implement or it is unsure how to implement it. In fact, we did the same thing more than ten years ago with Russia. We imposed the exact same types of sanctions, on both goods and services, on another state. We can do the same again. Indeed, it is even easier now because the EU-Israel Association Agreement means we must, by law, differentiate between goods and services from Israel and goods and services from the occupied territories. The Government's other argument is that there is a legal impediment. We have heard that argument shattered again and again today. We have already seen the legal advice that supports the inclusion of services. The Government has simply chosen to recreate legal opinions to support its political decision not to include services.",
                "The Government's lack of action is a betrayal of the trust the Irish people placed in it. We are a people who have a clear solidarity with the Palestinian cause that goes back decades and is unique across Europe and the globe. It gave us the opportunity to be the first to impose these sanctions and the first to take a case against Israel. Yet, we have wasted every opportunity to act on the mandate given to us by the Irish people. The Government's lack of action is a threat to global order. War crimes going unpunished will dismantle the decades of work people around the globe have done to maintain peace in our world. It threatens multilateralism and the rule of law. We need only look to the comparison with Russia to see this is the case.",
                "Above all, the lack of action is failing the people of Palestine who have endured the most horrific genocide and who continue to endure in the occupied territories brutal settlement practices by the Israeli Government. I add my condemnation of the Minister, on her first day in office, for failing to be here for this debate on what she says is her biggest priority."

The obstruction of the Occupied Territories Bill for the past six years since it was passed by a majority of TDs has shown up the utter hypocrisy of the Government when it speaks of the rule of international law, of the sanctity of human rights and of the importance of protecting our democracy from interference by nefarious regimes such as Russia. There was a cynical show of support for the Bill to win votes in advance of the general election last year followed by the rubbishing of the Bill by the Taoiseach, who said immediately afterwards that \"virtually every section\" of the Bill would need to be amended. This is a Bill his own party introduced to the Dáil in 2019 on behalf of Senator Black. The sound legal basis of this Bill has been established by a range of Irish and international experts, among them the former justice Minister and Attorney General, Senator Michael McDowell, who is not known for being on the radical left. The foreign affairs committee recommended the inclusion in the Bill of goods and services. How can you continue to argue against it, and to delay and dilute it, as Palestinians in the West Bank are subjected to unprecedented cycles of abuse and harassment from extremist settlers? Property in the West Bank is routinely ransacked, demolished or taken over; families are terrorised off their land; farm animals are mutilated; and olive plantations are razed to the ground. All of this after Gaza has been destroyed with psychopathic relish by the Israeli army. To continue appeasing these thugs and terrorists is morally bankrupt. I do not know Senator Black has maintained such a level of diplomatic calm and civility with this Government and the previous two Governments over all these years of deceit and deflection. It is a disgrace how you have treated her as the lead campaigner on this Bill; how you have taken such a haughty, moral-high-ground position of Ireland having done more for the Palestinians than any other country; and how you have allowed our democratic process to be interfered with by a rogue state for the past six years. The Government needs to pass the legislation, include goods and services, and stop the deceit."

It is a significant stain on the international community that it has been allowed to proceed in the manner it has. The images we have seen over the past number of years of an enormously powerful, well-armed Israel Defense Forces absolutely crushing a very poor, unarmed state right beside it are incredible. The injustice of the disparity between the two states is shocking. It has been allowed to proceed. It has been underwritten by the West and by the United States of America. Many countries like Ireland have spoken but in general, for practical purposes, have sat on the sidelines. I believe they have played a role in underwriting it as well.",

It is incredible that both here in Ireland and in South Africa we have moved past those conflicts, yet Palestine is still locked into an intractable conflict 20 or 30 years later. It frustrates me because Ireland has a proud history in terms of democracy, anti-colonialism, pushing back against nuclear proliferation and pushing for self-determination across the world. In relation to this, we have been laggards in fulfilling our responsibilities. Many Irish people see themselves in the eyes of Palestinian people because our histories are so similar. During the plantation of Ulster, Irish people lost their property and homelands to people coming from Scotland and England at the time. That sowed the seeds for 400 years of conflict. One of the most damaging things to do is to occupy a location, take territory off a location, steal homesteads, property and farms off people, remove them from those locations and simply occupy that area because that grievance does not disappear. It exists for generations beyond that. In terms of Israel's own defence and security, it is sowing the seeds of future damage to its country in the occupation of the West Bank. The use of famine in recent times as a tool of war again strikes a chord with so many Irish people. We suffered shockingly. I think Ireland is the only country in the whole world whose population is still lower today than it was in the 1840s. It is so hard to see.",

One of the easiest ways for a government to say no is to say yes and do nothing. That is exactly what the strategy is here. I have seen so many campaign groups come to the gates of Leinster House and TDs file out, get their photographs taken, put their arms around them, have a smile with them and then come back in here and do nothing. There is a disaster in that because the Government is not telling the truth about its purpose and motivation in relation to this. It is incredible that this passed Second Stage in 2018 - nearly eight years ago - and it has languished on Committee Stage since then. I do not believe the Government has the desire to see this through. As a result, I do not believe Ireland is using its potential position as a catalyst internationally to create the momentum that is necessary economically to check the actions of the Israeli state. That is a major loss and a major mistake. It is a dereliction of duty. There is a responsibility that comes with that. By not acting in those terms, we become responsible for the consequences. Those consequences are dire; they are shocking. They include the atomisation of young children by bombs in tents in places like Gaza and the stealing of land from families in the West Bank. The Government needs to get its act together and implement this legislation ASAP."

Some European countries have shown leadership. Ireland is to be commended on that. I hope the final judgment in legal terms will be in our favour to put additional pressure on the Israeli state.

I am not talking about financial contributions because that could actually do them more harm than good. There are a lot of decent, peace-minded people living in Israel who need our support. Most of all, they need access to unbiased information about what is happening because they are not getting it in their own country. It comes back to Israelis living in this country who think we are an antisemitic country. We do not have a proud history.",
                "We had a very mealy-mouthed attitude to dealing with Jewish refugees after the Second World War. That is to our shame. As a member of the EU, we have a huge impact on other member states. I referred before to a meeting with the Danish ambassador. Because Denmark did a lot of work rescuing Danish Jews during the Second World War, they have a certain relationship with Israel which they do not want to damage. I said that friends have to tell the truth to their friends. The same thing happens with the US. My question for the Minister and Cabinet colleagues is why it is now taking so long when earlier indications were that there were a few tweaks to go into Senator Black's Bill. Senator Black herself was reasonably optimistic and was taking on board some of the arguments and points that were being made, and wanted to move on.",
                "When I raised this after the summer recess, my impression from previous Government statements was that a lot of work would have been done over the summer and that we were ready to have the legislation passed through the Houses before Christmas. We are nowhere near that stage. Has the United States Government, in any way, shape or form, verbally or in writing, put pressure on the Irish Government not to proceed with this Bill? If any such threats have been made, they need to be put into the public domain. The reason the Irish people are so pro-Palestine is that we have empathy and compassion for a people who have been oppressed, because of our own history of oppression. Work has been done and I will give the Minister of State credit for that but we have a moral imperative to bring this legislation as far as it will go. If the Minister says it is unworkable, let us test it to see if that is the case. Otherwise, we are just hiding in plain sight. We have to do better than this. We have to bring this legislation through all the Houses of the Oireachtas and show some moral courage and leadership."

We all get thousands of emails about what we need to do, but we also get the negative ones from the other side. After I came back from my humanitarian mission, I can sympathise with the Deputy about how there is a strong lobby against this. We have to really focus on this. The decision should be straightforward. When I was sitting over there, I was supporting the Government. I still am. I was told that if we amended it, it would be done within six months. It has now been 11 months. The only time I have ever voted against this Government was for Palestine and I will continue to do that. I am committed to the programme for Government. I am not shouting at the Minister of State, Deputy Moran. He was in negotiations with me and knew I was fighting for Palestine in there. We have a commitment for this. Before the election, the Government parties had a commitment to this. We have the strongest mandate possible. Look at what the Spanish are doing. They have done it. Look at what South Africa is doing. I do commend the Government on joining the ICJ case but I am disappointed with the delays, the excuses and, as everyone has said, the verbal dances. I met Senator Frances Black and she has shown so much patience, dignity and resolve. The rest of us should learn from her. She carried this legislation further and for longer than she should have had to. Patience cannot be extended any longer. Again, I urge the Government not to oppose this motion but to immediately enact it.",
                "The Geneva Convention did not fall out of the sky. \"Never again\" means for everyone. I have been on the phone to Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank who I am now friends with. There is a young Palestinian living in Marino in my constituency, Amir. His family are in Gaza. His house has been blown up. His mother and father were doctors. All of their life savings are gone. They have nothing to go back to. How can I knock on his door again and not tell him that I did everything I could possibly do for him? That is the only reason I will not ever do it again. The international community has suggested that we did not know, that we were not sure, that we needed more time. It has been too long for that. Hundreds of thousands are dead. We do know. It is on our screens. How many reports have there been from the UN? Every country is now recognising the Palestinian state. What good is recognising a state that is on its knees, completely crumbled? I recognise what Deputy Gogarty said; we do know occupation. When our ancestors with grass-stained faces were on the side of the ditch during the occupation of country, would we not have liked another country to stand with us? We did have the Choctaw Nation. We did have the Ottoman Empire deliver three ships of grain, despite the UK insisting that they send only one ship. What country was in the Ottoman Empire at the time? Palestine. They were under occupation at that time but we will not talk about that.",
                "The Irish people outside this Chamber sometimes know about moral clarity. Over the past year, I have seen thousands of young people on the streets. Many of them are just so frustrated. When I am going to these doors, this is one of the main issues people still see. We need to do it immediately. These people out protesting are not extremists. They are not disrupters. They are the conscience of this country. I saw it in my own constituency two weeks ago with the Hope Palestine action, great northsiders who cycled and raised money for Doctors Without Borders. They understood that humanitarian organisations are often the last lifeline when politics fails.",
                "I stood on the flotilla. When we were illegally abducted by the IOF, when I had a gun pointed at my head and was called an Irish terrorist, when we were mocked, I was told that Ireland is the most antisemitic country in the world. We are not antisemitic. We had Israelis on the flotilla with us who are against the current government. I have spoken to Israelis who are against what the current government is doing. When we are called antisemitic, we need to be clear and say we are not antisemitic. We are anti-Zionist and against what the current Israeli state is doing. When a TD and a Senator are illegally abducted, mocked and brutalised against every international law - look at where we were abducted - does Israel not have to abide by international law? It clearly has not. All the activists who went on those flotillas did not do it to be on the selfie yacht, as Israel portrayed. They did it to bring aid and open a humanitarian corridor to a population that is facing genocide and famine. Doctors Without Borders was in here last week talking about the struggles it is having getting the aid in. This is not directed at the Minister of State. I have spoken to him and know he is on the same side on this.",
                "Ireland has always claimed to stand with the oppressed, from the anti-apartheid struggle, which I heard Deputies mention, to the Good Friday Agreement. We have never been neutral on injustice and we must not be neutral now. We have such great political power as a nation. As a small population, we are respected worldwide, which is why the enactment of this Bill will hopefully trigger more countries to act, like Spain has already done and as Belgium, Norway and other countries are now considering in their parliaments. Passing the occupied territories Bill does not make us radical. It makes us consistent and credible. It makes us Irish. We have done this before with South Africa. We triggered a bulldozer effect that led to peace and a solution. As Deputy Gogarty says, we know famine, occupation and hunger strikes. I bring attention also to the prisoners across England engaged in a rolling hunger strike for Palestine, refusing food to protest the repression of the Palestine Action group and the denial of the basic legal rights they are facing. Some are already in serious medical distress, with healthcare withheld and punitive measures imposed, yet they continue their strike in solidarity with the Palestinian people. They are joined by prisoners internationally, from Italy to the United States, showing that this struggle crosses borders. Their courage and refusal to be silenced, and their willingness to put their own bodies on the line, demand our attention and our action.",

I always say that in politics you give a contract to your constituency on what you are planning to do. If you do not break that contract with your constituency, it will not break its contract with you. However, we are breaking that contract. We said we would enact the occupied territories Bill. Eleven months on and it has been kicked down the road. I ask the Government to honour its commitments and to honour international law - legal obligations we proudly say we defend - because history will not remember the delays but it will remember how and whether we acted. Right now, we are not acting."

The general scheme before the House delivers on this commitment. Trade and services are considerably more complex than is the case with goods. There remains considerable legal uncertainty as whether the inclusion of services is permissible under EU law. We also have to take account of practical issues with regard to implementation where services are to be included in the scope of this Bill.

We have at all times sought to take action, both to address immediate needs and to make a longer-term contribution to peace and stability in the Middle East. Ireland's principal stance, backed up by concrete actions, has been widely acknowledging, including by partners in the region.",

This was a step we took alongside Norway and Spain in May 2024. At the EU level, Ireland has been to the forefront in calling for appropriate European action in response to Israel's breaches of international law, often advocating for policies at an early stage that have later garnered widespread support. Ireland led the way on the proposal to review Israel's compliance to article 2 of the association agreement, first proposing this step alongside Spain in February 2024. The European External Action Service's subsequent review found that Israel is in breach of its human obligations. This is no surprise to anybody in this Chamber.",

We have made clear our view that the EU must keep these proposals on the table regardless.",

We are taking extensive actions at the international level in response to the situation in Gaza and the West Bank and in support of the people of Palestine. Through our work as a co-chair of a working group alongside Türkiye, we are one of a small number of EU member states that played a central role at the high-level UN conference on implementing the two-state solution held in New York last July. The outcome document of the conference - the New York declaration - was endorsed by 142 countries in a vote at the UN General Assembly. The Taoiseach attended a reconvened session of the conference during the UN high-level week in September where he called for a political path to end the cycle of violence.",

The working connection with the UN high-level conference and its output is an expression of relationships that we have developed, including with partners in the region in relation to the shared goals in support of the two-state solution. Ireland has been an active participant in the seven meetings of the global alliance for the implementation of the two-state solution that have taken place since its establishment at UN high-level week last year.

The Department has conducted eight complex evacuation operations from Gaza over the past six months after borders reopened in April. In 2024, the Government approved the evacuation of up to 30 sick children from Gaza to Ireland for treatment and care. A total of 21 patients have already been medically evacuated to Ireland, along with 52 accompanying family members.

That additional €6 million brought Ireland's support to the people of Palestine to over €35 million this year. This €6 million will be allocated to Ireland's UN partners, including €2 million to UNICEF, €2 million to United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA, €1 million to the World Food Programme and €1 million to WHO.

The officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in headquarters and throughout the mission network, particularly in the region, continue to work tirelessly to represent Ireland's strong position on the conflict based on the fundamental principles of international law. Ireland's position - the fundamental belief that all states must adhere to international law - has never faltered. What we can do and do can make a difference. Ireland's engagement on the issue has not waned and will not. We will continue our work to promote peace and a path towards a negotiated two-state solution with Israel and Palestine living side by side in real peace and security."

We passed sanctions against Russia, quite correctly, and we need to stop the pussyfooting on the occupied territories Bill - no half measures. There have been no half measures from the terrorist state of Israel in the past two years: hospitals, places of prayer and tents housing refugees who are fleeing; women, children and men slaughtered; ambulance crews bombed; and aerial bombardment on a scale I have never seen before. The State of Israel has used Palestinian boys and girls as target practice for its soldiers. Throughout all the genocide and terror of the past two years, it has continued the campaign of murder and intimidation of people in the West Bank. That continues.",

It is to make sure that there cannot be a two-state solution, break up the West Bank in so many small pieces, make all the farms and businesses unviable and intimidate Palestinian communities out of their homes so as Israel can fully occupy their lands. Israel has bulldozed crops, farmsteads, businesses and homes right throughout the past two years while its campaign of slaughter in Gaza has continued, bullying families off their own land and replacing them with Yankees from Dixieland and North Carolina simply on the basis that they are Jewish. I do not care about anybody's religion. I do not care what religion anybody is. That has nothing to do with it. This is about right and wrong. This has been wrong from the beginning and we have to stand up for what is right. Israel's plan is to make the two-state solution unviable, and that is why we must stand firm on this.",

The EU-Israel trade agreement should have been halted a long time ago. We are not powerless here to take action. We may be a small enough State. We took the decision to recognise the State of Palestine in this Chamber about a decade ago, and since then several other states have done so. We set an example 40 years ago. In fact, the women in Dunnes Stores here in Dublin set the example when they refused to handle South African fruit. That set in train a worldwide boycott of South African goods that brought to its knees the apartheid regime in South Africa, a regime that a lot of people thought could not be brought down.",

International law is very clear. We have a responsibility to act. We cannot have any more excuses. It has gone long past time. I appeal to the Minister of State and the Government to do the right thing. It is disappointing to see all the Government benches empty. The Minister of State is here, he has a role in terms of his Government brief on this and he takes an interest in it but this is shocking. This is really important legislation.

I thank Senator Frances Black for her ongoing efforts since she instigated this Bill in 2018. Most importantly, I thank the hundreds of thousands of people in this country who have mobilised again and again in unprecedented protests in every city, town, village and hamlet of the country against the genocidal horror that Israel has been inflicting on the Palestinian people over the past two years. All those people can see the political and moral bankruptcy of this Government when it comes to the issue of Palestine. The speech that was given really is shameful. This starts with the failure of the new Minister to come in here. People who are not familiar with how this place works need to understand that the Minister's absence is a studied exercise in contempt designed to make sure that this debate does not get any media coverage. That is why the Government has done that. It did not want this to get attention, even though it was clear it was the issue on which the Minister was under pressure. She spoke about it yesterday night on television and said she would talk to her Government colleagues about it today but she did not bother to come into the Dáil, the democratically elected Chamber of these Houses, where it is being discussed, to discuss it. It is a studied exercise in contempt and it speaks volumes about the Government's strategy on this issue for years, speaking out of both sides of its mouth on the issue of Palestine, mouthing solidarity but doing absolutely nothing - not a single sanction against the State of Israel.",

There have been people campaigning in this country all those years, more than 30 years, demanding the end of the State of Israel's impunity for the ongoing crimes it has been committing since 1948. In fact, the Zionist movement has been committing crimes against Palestinians since before 1948 and has been explicit about it. Zionism is clear: Zionists intend to ethnically cleanse Palestine. Zionism is genocidal in its very nature and character. There have been decades of ethnic cleansing and apartheid, the siege of Gaza and then the genocide of the past two years, with still not a single sanction from this Government.",
                "The bankruptcy of the EU is equally on display. Last night the Minister and the Taoiseach came in here and said it was absolutely essential to impose sanctions and they imposed 19 different rounds of sanctions. That was done almost instantaneously. The double standards are absolutely clear. It is only really because of the heroic resistance of the Palestinian people that we have what is not even a ceasefire. Israel killed 13 people in Lebanon last night and has killed about 260 people since the so-called ceasefire, which was forced on Israel and Donald Trump. That is what happened. Trump even admitted it when he said he rang up Netanyahu and told him they could not take on the world. That is what he said. They were forced into the ceasefire. The Minister of State's speech thanks the United States for their efforts in bringing about a ceasefire. Is he joking? Israel could not continue the ethnic cleansing of Palestine, the illegal settlements and the genocidal horror it has inflicted on Gaza were it not for that \"complicity\", although that is too weak a word. Israel is simply acting as an outpost of US foreign policy, something Biden admitted when he said, \"Were there not an Israel, the United States of America would have to invent an Israel\". They would have to station US troops in the Middle East because this is all about American colonial and imperial control of that region, collaborating with brutal dictatorships and then with the State of Israel as their military watchdog to slap down any attempt by the people of that region to assert their right to self-determination. That is what it is about. It is absolutely shocking that the Government has failed to do anything about it but that is the truth. The Government is dancing to the tune of Trump and so on but showing utter contempt for the people of this country, for democracy and for the solemn promises the Government made. It was forced to make them in the run-up to the election because it knew what the people of this country wanted and demanded.",

The Government should be doing a hell of a lot more. We should be completely boycotting the State of Israel. Can the Government at least do what it said what it would do?"

We paid just under €20 in VAT, €20 in carbon tax and a standing charge of around the same, all totaling €59.80. The next gas bill will be double that as the weather has changed. This is nearly impossible for us. It looks like we will freeze again this year. It is just survival now.",
                "When people are describing their lives as \"survival\", something is deeply wrong. However, this is the reality so many are living in and this is the Ireland of 2025. Yet, the Government has scrapped the energy credits just as people's bills are rising again. It leaves families to face the cold entirely on their own at the harshest time of the year. Yesterday, St. Vincent de Paul said it expects a quarter of a million calls for help this year. That is a quarter of a million people and families turning to charity because they cannot make ends meet. This tells us how serious, how widespread and how devastating this hardship has become.",
                "Across the board, everything is getting dearer. Rents are through the roof as is the weekly food shop. Parents are budgeting down to the last euro. People feel it every time they go to the supermarket or to the petrol station and every time they try to pay a bill. Life is getting harder, not easier.",
                "This is the point: the biggest hit of all is one the Government chose to impose. By increasing student fees by €500, it pushed up the cost of education more than anything else this year. For families with students, this is a massive extra burden. It is the single steepest rise in any household cost and the Government caused it. Of course, it also hiked up fuel costs, petrol, diesel and home heating oil.",

Tá an teocht le titim go dtí -3° le sioc agus leac oighir agus táthar ag súil le cúinsí contúirteacha sna laethanta amach romhainn. Tá imní ar dhaoine mar tá a fhios acu nach féidir leo teacht slán ar gheimhreadh eile cosúil leis an gceann deireanach a bhí againn. Bhain an Rialtas na creidiúintí fuinnimh uathu, ach tá siad ag teastáil ó dhaoine anois láithreach. Caithfidh an Rialtas an cinneadh sin a mhalartú.",

These are deliberate decisions taken knowing full well the pressure families were already under. I have raised the issue of the energy companies and their exorbitant prices time and again in this Chamber. I warned repeatedly but the Government failed to appreciate the scale of what is happening out there. I have to continue raising these points because, as the weather gets colder, the hardship increases and more people are pushed to the brink. I have asked the Government before to tackle the energy companies and get them to end their rip-off.",

I ask again, and I ask plainly: will the Government please restore the energy credits or is it prepared to allow families to struggle through winter under its policies?"

                "The Government finally published its long overdue housing plan last week. After all the anticipation, what it delivered was nothing more than old milk in new bottles. There was nothing new on affordable homeownership, no clarity on what new powers the Land Development Agency will have and no ambition on social housing. It is just an open door for speculators and land hoarders. Worse again, the Government has abandoned annual targets for new home building. Could there be a more blatant admission of failure than that?",
                "The Government has also essentially confessed to the locked-out generation that it has truly run out of ideas, simply telling them to hang in there while removing the very tools needed to measure progress. It does not take a genius to understand why. When you scrap metrics, you scrap accountability. Worst of all, the Taoiseach's Government has normalised the eviction of children, at a time more than 5,000 children are without a home. This a national disgrace and the Government's housing plan is a disgrace.",
                "People can see the Government has no real plan for housing. It is forming policy on the hoof, so it is no wonder its policies do not work. Let us take its recent plans to rip up minimum apartment standards and gut planning rules less than a year after the then Minister for housing, Deputy O'Brien, passed what he called \"a comprehensive planning law\".",
                "On a random Sunday last July, the Government leaked to the papers new plans to make homes smaller by drastically cutting planning standards. There is nothing wrong with trying new things and, indeed, each week the Labour Party and others urge the Government to change its housing policies, but not like this because the Government tried this move before and it was a disaster then. If we cast our minds back to 2018, the then Fine Gael housing Minister, Eoghan Murphy, introduced similar plans to reduce standards and a regulatory mess ensued. Indeed, it was a mess that forced one of his successors, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, to amend apartment design rules again.",
                "Why does the Government opt to repeat the mistakes of the past and, worse, to do more than merely repeating them? The current Minister for housing, Deputy Browne has sought to introduce a wrong-headed change without the required strategic environmental assessment.",
                "Relaxing minimum housing standards was not in Fianna Fáil nor Fine Gael's election manifestos last year That is no wonder because if it was, they would have spent the election campaign explaining why people should look for a return to shoe boxes and grotty bedsits. They would have faced the same critique they are getting now from the Irish Planning Institute. Instead of announcing it, the two parties kept it quiet and ran on falsely inflated home building projections.",
                "When the Government leaked those plans on a Sunday last July, the Cabinet agreed it by the following Tuesday and councillors justifiably brought a legal challenge to its hasty change. The Government lashed out. The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste attacked me and the Labour Party's housing spokesperson, Deputy Conor Sheehan, and accused our party of weaponising the courts because our councillor, Darragh Moriarty, was one of the councillors involved.",
                "The Government then backed down in the courts on Monday of this week. It was a dramatic climbdown. This was a significant development that shows that there is no strategy and that no strategy underlies this change. It just an admission of failure. Does the Taoiseach admit that the Government's housing policies are failing, its attempt to reduce apartment standards has failed and its new housing plan is a further admission of failure?"

We have significantly transformed the scale and pace of social housing delivery over the past five years. That has to be acknowledged. I have looked at the Labour Party's manifesto on housing. It is so vague as to be unbelievable. It is bereft of any depth or substance. The Labour Party has put no flesh on the bone of any of its proposals.",

We have done a number of other measures in terms of the reform of rent pressure zones. The Deputy opposed that too, of course, because she just wants to be popular all the time. We are focused since we came into government on doing things around housing to reform the rental market. That is in line with the Housing Commission report, by the way, which called for reform of the rental market. We followed through on that in an evidence-based and informed way in terms of those who made recommendations to the Minister to come forward with proposals for the rental sector. I get the sense all the time that no matter what Government proposes, the Deputy will oppose it. We need different housing types and apartment types for different cohorts of the population who require accommodation and housing."

                "In the lead-up to the last general election, the Taoiseach cynically misled the public about how many homes would be delivered. This was a blatant attempt to give the impression he was turning the corner on housing delivery. In reality, he was driving it off a cliff. We were told 40,000 homes would be delivered in 2024; in fact, it was 30,300, nearly 25% short of the target. The Taoiseach and Government have been consistently moving the goalposts when it comes to housing targets. Now, in the most blatant move to avoid accountability yet, they have elected to take the goalposts off the pitch entirely because not only have they removed annual targets from their long-awaited, much-hyped housing plan but the overall target goes beyond the lifetime of the Government. I have to ask: is the Taoiseach actually serious?",
                "It is clear to everyone paying attention that the housing Minister is bereft of new ideas, dusting off old policy measures that have demonstrably failed. The Government wanted to reduce apartment sizes to reduce costs, something that has been tried not once but twice: Deputy Alan Kelly did it first when he was housing Minister in 2015, followed by Eoghan Murphy in 2018. It did not work on either of those occasions. I know, the Taoiseach knows and we all know it will not work now. The Government had a chance to abandon those plans this week when it was forced to withdraw them at the High Court but we are told it is still determined to plough on.",
                "Tens of thousands of people across this country were hoping against hope for a radical reset of housing policy. With this plan, they are left with their head in their hands. Under the Government's latest so-called affordable housing scheme, a minimum salary of €56,000 is required to buy a one-bed apartment. What is affordable about that? That is too expensive for teachers, retail workers, gardaí, nurses and the vast majority of workers on average incomes. The Taoiseach's old plans failed these people and let us face it: the new one will too.",
                "The Government has no credibility on housing. Its record is one of continued failure and continued refusal to acknowledge it, no matter how bad things get but strip away all the spin and this is what the latest housing plan amounts to: a public declaration of failure. Instead of changing course, it is trying to avoid being held to account, removing targets so it is easier to disguise its failure. You could not make it up. How many homes will the Government deliver over its lifetime?"

The housing plan has substance in it in terms of proposals to do that. We did not wait for it. We decided straight in to do, for example, the national planning framework to get more land zoned for housing. Deputy Cairns will have problems with that on the ground and no doubt her people will oppose it where there is extra zoning and so on.",
                "In terms of apartments, we are not standing still and just looking at a problem. We come up with proposals and ideas but people from the Opposition will get into the courts and try to stem those. The apartment guidelines are one strand among a series of measures we are taking to get to the volume needed. We have moved. When the Government came in in 2020, only 20,000 houses were being built per year; now it is 30,000-odd but it needs to get to 50,000. That will need a combination of public investment at unprecedented levels, which is provided for in the national development plan and in our budget, and significant private sector finance. The only thing the Deputy has come up with is a savings and investment scheme. That is fine; in a couple of years' time that might be useful. It will not do anything now in terms of funding investment of houses."

The nitrates directive has been talked about for many years and Ireland's derogation is central to the findings in this and previous reports because stricter limits are now absolutely required to protect our water quality. This 2025 report shows that while some improvements have been made in specific areas, the excess nutrients continue to degrade our water quality.",
                "These elevated nitrogen levels are particularly evident in the south and south east. That is no surprise as it is where the most intensive dairy farming is concentrated. These regions that are most affected by the nitrates derogation allow certain farms to exceed the standard limit of 170 kg of nitrogen per hectare. Under EU rules, the derogation farms in these sensitive catchments must now reduce their stocking rates from 250 kg to 220 kg, which is a recognition by the EU that we have to come down because we were not making any progress.",
                "The report stresses that 44,000 sq. km of land has been identified as requiring additional measures to meet the EU water quality standards. The European Commission has also expanded its criteria for Ireland's derogation renewal, demanding not only progress on water quality but also conservation of designated habitats and species, which underscores how the nitrates directive and other environmental obligations such as the habitats directive are interconnected. Our whole environment is interconnected. It is not possible to put excrement on land at a certain quantity without it having an impact on the quality of the lives of all our citizens, especially young children who are most affected by nitrates.",
                "The expansion of dairy farming is linked to the nutrient surpluses. If our dairy industry is not sustainable, we need to focus on lower intensity, organic quality produce for export. We are now the only EU country still seeking a derogation. Denmark, for example, has an intensive agricultural system but does not have a derogation. Therefore, we need to continue to reduce our nitrates or we will lose any flexibility we had and face tougher EU sanctions. We have the nitrates action programme but it is not enough. The consultation period ends on 1 December. Is the Government seriously considering getting rid of our derogation?"

There will be a new nitrates action plan and a new plan on habitats and so forth. We are different from other countries in Europe. Our farm system is unique in being a pasture-based outdoor system, with cows based outside 240 days per year on average. That is in contrast with other EU countries that have an intensive indoor system, with cattle not being outdoors very often.",
                "It is a priority of the Government to secure a nitrates derogation but to do so in a way that will enable Ireland to meet its obligations on water quality. Farming has improved significantly and a lot of new measures have been adopted by the farming community in respect of climate change more generally and in terms of water quality. Many farmers do a lot of work in terms of assessment and measuring. I have been on farms and in catchment areas where water quality is measured every ten minutes. Many people operating under the derogation have more sophisticated systems in place to try to monitor their water quality.",

I have discussed this with the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen. The EU Commissioner for the environment, Jessika Roswall, visited Ireland on 4 November to witness first hand our grass-based system and the importance of our derogation. The Minister, Deputy Heydon, attended and engaged with the Commissioner. There has been a lot of stakeholder engagement with the Government and Departments in respect of this. Farmers are doing a lot to reduce agriculture's impact on water quality and will be doing more. They will have to do more in that regard.",

Our healthcare system is also affected and the cost of our healthcare system is affected when our rivers are not at optimal quality. The Government can wheel in as many senior officials from the European Commission as it likes to witness first hand our outdoor grass-based system but in reality the system is not working. We are just kicking the can down the road. Are we hanging on a bit like climate change to see whether Europe will water things down?

We should not dismiss - I am not saying the Deputy is doing this, to be fair - the fact that food security is becoming an issue because of climate. I accept the point about complementarity, that there is balance in all of this. To the Deputy's fundamental point, I accept that environmental sustainability is important, and is not separate from economic sustainability, but we are endeavouring to create a pathway to environmental sustainability in the context of food production that reflects economic sustainability as an imperative as well."

                "I return to the saga of Dundrum House Hotel in Tipperary. On Monday, the High Court delivered a judgment that quashed the section 5 planning exemption granted for Dundrum House Hotel. The ruling confirmed what local communities have been saying for over a year, that there is no legal or planning basis for an IPAS centre at this site. The certificate underpinning this arrangement should never have been issued. Despite this, the Taoiseach's Government continues to stand over a multi-million euro contract with Utmasta Limited, worth up to €8.5 million a year, to operate a facility that is clearly operating outside the law.",
                "This is not simply a legal failure; it has been a social, economic and financial disaster for Dundrum and south Tipperary. There are serious moral questions for the Government about how it could engage with contractors who have not filed accounts and are not compliant with our laws. The High Court has ruled definitively that Dundrum House Hotel is non-compliant. We know that more than 20 IPAS contracts have already been terminated this year for non-compliance with planning, building or fire regulations. Why is Dundrum House Hotel allowed to operate continually like this when it is in this category? Continuing to fund this contract undermines the integrity of the Government's decision-making and shows absolute disregard for the authority of the courts and this country's planning laws.",
                "We have already seen the loss of 48 jobs here when Dundrum House Hotel closed its doors, and the collapse of a vital tourism and leisure hub that sustained golf, hospitality and community life, and indeed tourism and culture events as well. Let us not forget that when people stood up against this, and for their rights, they were met with a tyranny of force by An Garda Síochána's riot squad, canine squad and God knows what.",
                "I have some questions for the Taoiseach. Will his Government immediately revoke the IPAS contract for Dundrum House Hotel in light of the High Court ruling? Will he confirm that no further taxpayers' money will be paid under the contract, which has no legal foundation whatsoever? Will he acknowledge the grave wrong done to the people of Dundrum village and community, who have been vindicated by the courts, and commit to restoring this amenity to its rightful role in supporting rural development and to changing how decisions about these contracts are made by the Government? Finally, will the Taoiseach commit to a full review of how the contract was awarded, given serious concerns about planning compliance, transparency and the suitability of Utmasta Limited? High Court evidence shows that companies associated with Dundrum House Hotel have not been tax compliant for six years. Just imagine. Any other citizen would not offer that company their business, so what kind of example are we showing? Why was the company deemed suitable for a State contract worth up to €8.5 million annually when all this was known and pointed out by the people and by us as public representatives too?"

My understanding is that Dundrum House Hotel had not been operating as a hotel since 2015, so I do not think it ceased being a hotel because of the decision in 2022 to use it for, initially, the beneficiaries of temporary protection following the war in Ukraine. I understand the first initial use of Dundrum House Hotel was for Ukrainians feeling the war. The Deputy might clarify that for me. I understand that it had not been in use as a hotel since 2015, which would be about seven years earlier. I think the adjacent golf club and catering facilities are still being used by the public and the community since that time.",
                "The Deputy is correct that the Department of justice entered a contract in April 2025 with a company called Utmasta Limited to provide international protection accommodation at Dundrum House. That followed a detailed appraisal process and community engagement since summer 2024. My understanding is that it has a contracted maximum capacity of more than 200. About 190 people are accommodated there at the moment. Part of that appraisal process for a new contract included a review of the property services and compliance. This was done in conjunction with the local authority in the case of this contract, and a section 5 exemption was granted by the local authority. That is my understanding of what happened. Utmasta Limited has engaged with Tipperary County Council and has given a commitment to regularise any outstanding planning matters at the wider site. My understanding is that there are two separate legal matters ongoing relating to the property, neither of which involve the Department of justice or the Government directly. There was a judicial review into the planning exemption granted by Tipperary County Council to Dundrum House. This was initiated by the local heritage group. I understand that the owners decided not to continue to defend the proceedings.",
                "The accommodation provider lodged its own section 5 application to Tipperary County Council in October of this year. This was referred to An Coimisiún Pleanála by the local authority for a decision, as the local authority said it was unable to make a decision on the matter. As the Deputy knows, the case is due to be decided by 13 March 2026, according to pleanala.ie. There is another dispute, which I do not want to comment on, which is not really relevant to me, about ownership and so on. The Department is saying, based on the fact that the contract and leases were and still are in place, that IPAS is continuing to use the property. If any action should be required as a result of any court proceedings, this will be addressed by officials as appropriate."

The Taoiseach does not seem to get the issue. We are dealing with rogue contractors. We pointed out to the integration team - Deputy Michael Murphy and I pointed this out to the Minister - that it was outside the law and that the council gave a section 5 exemption in error. It has conceded that. Now the hotel has gone back for another section 5 exemption, which the council has kicked to An Coimisiún Pleanála. It is just a game of Russian roulette and money for fat cats. The real problem is that the Government is paying too much per person who is being housed by IPAS. The Taoiseach is wrong in saying that the Department of justice gave the contract. It was the former Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, and his Department at the time that ran amok and invited everyone from Timbuktu to Ireland, to come and have their own front door in 30 days or something. This is crazy. The people deserve better here. They deserve a better reply from the Taoiseach. I want the Taoiseach to instruct the Minister, Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, to meet Deputy Murphy and me.

Can I also ask the Taoiseach to confirm that the whistleblower evidence that has come forward, which goes to the very heart of what happened in this service, will form a core part of the inquiry’s work? In the meantime, as this inquiry is being established, what immediate action is the Government taking to ensure that no other child is abandoned in the way that Harvey was?"

A memo to the Government recommending a statutory public model of inquiry into spina bifida and complex scoliosis services at CHI was approved by the Government, but considerable work will be required. There is a time-bound scoping exercise to happen first. A facilitator will be appointed to scope potential terms of reference in collaboration with all involved, including advocates, parents and others. It is proposed to appoint an independent person, a senior counsel, following that consultation, and it will also involve the Office of the Attorney General. Concluding terms of reference, the modality of an inquiry and the costs associated takes time, but we want it time-bound so it will be as efficient as it can be."

All of us are concerned to ensure that the newly announced inquiry will be comprehensive and effective in getting to the root of the issues here. As my colleague, Deputy Sherlock, has said, a twin-track approach is needed, first to address the disgraceful failures in respect of children like Harvey, and, second to get a handle on what is continuing to happen for children in the system today. I know all of us hear from families who have been told their child requires surgery, yet are given no date, no confirmation of treatment and no offer of treatment abroad. We also need to hear whether further protected disclosures are being made and what is to happen to children on waiting lists now."

With inquiries, the terms of reference are very important because there needs to be some timeline to it, for the sake of all concerned. That is an issue to be worked out. About 446 spinal procedures were completed so far this year to the end of October. That is up on last year, but there is rising demand and, over the same timeframe, a total of 462 procedures were added to the waiting list. At the end of October 2025, about 68% of patients on the active list were waiting less than six months, an improvement from this time last year, when about 56% of patients were waiting less than six months. There are improvements happening, notwithstanding the very serious issues that we have to deal with. Some 6% were waiting over 12 months, which is a significant improvement against this time last year, but, of course, that is too high."

We have been targeting our resources at the lowest income groups. That is why we took the decisions that we did in the budget. We did not go for universal payments, which some Deputies wanted us to do. We targeted resources at those most in need, and likewise in terms of free schoolbooks and hot school meals. That is all to reduce costs for families, and it particularly helps families on low incomes. There are other measures that we have taken, such as extending the VAT reduction on fuel costs, which will go out to 2030, and many others."

Work is ongoing, and Laois County Council is playing its part in trying to advance those schemes as quickly as possible. However, because of all the different hoops that these schemes have to go through, schemes are taking between 15 and 17 years. I think we can all agree that is too long. It is a ridiculous length of time. The Mountmellick scheme has gone to An Coimisiún Pleanála, which is welcome. Hopefully, it can make a decision soon. However, as things stand, the Mountmellick scheme will not be done until 2031 at the earliest. For the Portarlington scheme, we are looking at 2033."

The Minister for public expenditure is coming to the Government in the next number of weeks in respect of measures that will accelerate the infrastructure development in the country. To me, flood protection is a key infrastructure that is required. Where we have implemented flood relief schemes, they have been very effective. In fact, the report on Storm Amy was that the flood relief schemes, where they have been constructed and built, worked, by and large. There is an urgency, but everybody wants to have their say, as the Deputy knows, and we end up in An Coimisiún Pleanála."

They are looking for justice, they are looking for 100% redress, they are looking for retrospective payments and they are looking for fair timelines. IS 465:2018 is unjust and, indeed, has become a barrier to so many families. Recently, a family in Mayo bought a house in good faith and got an engineer’s report. However, they bought after the cut-off date that the Government introduced in its scheme and, as a result of this cut-off, cannot avail of the defective concrete scheme."

Tailte Éireann’s current practice appears to be to send dealings to the first department, and if an error is identified, the dealings are immediately returned for amendment before forwarding them to the next department. As a result, a dealing can be returned several times without explanation, leading to huge delays.

I want to raise the urgent need for a modern, fit-for-purpose fire station in Monasterevin. The current building is outdated and inadequate, and it no longer meets the needs of a growing town. The previously proposed site on the Dublin road has fallen through again, leaving the project stalled while the community waits. Other viable sites have been identified in the area, so this project is possible if we have the political will to back it up. It is not only a planning issue but a matter of public safety. The latest report by the National Oversight and Audit Commission, NOAC, shows that Kildare’s retained brigade takes an average of seven minutes and five seconds to mobilise after being notified of an emergency. This is significantly higher than the national average, which is five minutes and 31 seconds. When Monasterevin does not even have a fit-for-purpose station, those delays become even more dangerous. Will the Taoiseach ensure that the purchase of a newly identified site is fast-tracked, that funding is released immediately and that a new station is delivered within this term?"

The Government accepted this, and I have been informed that capital funding has been provided. For a period going on two years, we have been consistently informed that the OPW and Garda are liaising on the matter. This liaison is threatening to go on longer than many marriages I have come across. I ask the Taoiseach to use his good offices to bring this liaison to an end and move the project forward. Over 20,000 people live in the area and there is a tsunami of antisocial behaviour because the area is not being properly policed."

Anyway, we went ahead and built the new school but the population has grown exponentially. I will endeavour to turn the liaison between the OPW and An Garda Síochána into a more mature contract but I take the Deputy’s point that the station is required.

Whenever we have these heroes from the north inner city – I assure the Taoiseach we have many of them - inevitably, the conversation turns to the lack of facilities. Once again, when we talk about soccer, there are no football or AstroTurf pitches in the north inner city. When it was Kellie Harrington, there were no boxing facilities that were well funded by the State. The north inner-city task force has been well funded - I admit that - but we still have the same lack of facilities, meaning these sporting heroes have to travel outside of their own communities.

Overcrowding is impacting on the physical, psychological and emotional safety of women who are living in rooms originally intended as single accommodation. Overcrowding is a result of the failure of criminal justice policy. It compromises the provision and effectiveness of rehabilitation. Deaths in prison are up by 50% in the last year. What action will the Government take to reduce the number of women in prison? What credible alternatives to custody will the Government bring forward for women to address this?

The committee last met on 30 October and the date of its next meeting has not yet been scheduled. The committee is informed by the work of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, which monitors and reports on water quality in Ireland. The EPA recently published its report Water Quality in Ireland 2019-2024, which shows water quality improvements in some areas but also an overall decline in waterbodies in a satisfactory ecological condition. While the overall ecological status of Ireland’s waters is significantly better than the European Union average, the downward trend is a matter of concern. The report shows that targeted actions in the agricultural sector and improvements in wastewater treatment appear to be paying dividends, with lower reported levels of nutrients in water bodies where targeted actions have been taken.",
                    "The Cabinet committee has also examined the investment programme of Uisce Éireann to improve wastewater treatment capacity and meet best practice in managing its existing infrastructure. Last week, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage published a sectoral plan for water services and water quality. This includes record investment of €12.2 billion, largely allocated to Uisce Éireann to support the delivery of the additional water services capacity required to deliver the Government's housing plan and to improve water quality. This investment will help to deliver the Government water action plan, Ireland's roadmap to protect and restore our rivers, lakes, estuaries, coastal waters and ground waters.",
                    "Last year, the Government also published Water and Agriculture: A Collaborative Approach, and this report sets out measures to address the twin objectives of improving water quality and demonstrating that a robust case exists for the maintenance of a derogation for Ireland from certain aspects of the EU nitrates directive. In October, the Minister, Deputy Browne, published a draft nitrates action programme, which will form the basis of Ireland’s ongoing discussions with the European Commission on a new derogation. The Minister has invited submissions from the public on its contents. A public consultation process on the strategic environmental assessment and appropriate assessment of the plan is also live, with submissions invited by 1 December.",
                    "European Union environmental Commissioner Roswall visited Ireland last week and met with the Minister, Deputy Heydon, as well as farmers and other stakeholders to discuss Ireland's application for a derogation and the importance of its continuation to Ireland's outdoor, grass-based livestock systems. The visit provided an opportunity for the Commissioner to visit a farm in County Kildare to see at first hand the efforts towards improving water quality and to engage with public representatives and stakeholders. Discussions with the Commission are ongoing to find an approach that facilitates the continuation of high-quality dairy and beef production by derogation farmers while ensuring sufficient protection for the quality and ecological status of our rivers, lakes and estuaries."

Farmers are really keen to know where they stand and they are going to need to know that for the start of the year. Retaining this derogation is vital. I very much impressed this on Commissioner Roswall during her recent visit to Ireland. She did acknowledge that progress had been made but she was also keen to see that there would be ongoing progress and improvements. Will the Minister and the Government be able to win support across EU colleagues to ensure the derogation will be retained? Additionally, farmers are also being told they are not alone in respect of improving water quality. They are keen to pull their weight and they will, but they also need to know that municipal waste inputs and Irish Water will also pull their weight."

When there is heavy rainfall, the sewage shoots out beside a residential area in a beautiful park. It is still happening. It happened again last weekend with the heavy rainfall. In March 2024, I got a reply from Uisce Éireann accepting that it was impacting the environment and posing a risk to public health through flooding. At that time, it said it was at stage 3 of a four-stage process and it would have options and costings in quarter 4 of 2024. In August 2024, I followed up on this matter. I got a response in February of this year, over six months after the promised commencement of stage 4. The company apologised for the delay and said it was concluding stage 3 and moving into stage 4. I have followed up again with the company. It is simply unacceptable that the health of residents and park users is put at risk and that the deadlines for action keep getting delayed. Does the Taoiseach agree that Irish Water, Uisce Éireann, must act?"

A brand new public mains runs just 500 m from the townland of Fews across from these men's homes. Connecting these homes would require just a short bore under a regional road but Uisce Éireann has refused to fund it and instead told residents to apply for a private well grant. Unfortunately, the land in the area they live in is not suitable for a private well and they have that on good authority from several professional well drillers. Will the Taoiseach please act in the interests of these two households and instruct Uisce Éireann? I will show the Taoiseach, very briefly, a bottle with a sample of water they provided me with recently. It illustrates the depth of what their public water supply is."

Some of these constituents are here today with the visual artists from Palestine who raised money for Artists Without Borders in Clontarf Castle. They are going to be swimming in that water. These are the people who need this water protected. We see in Dún Laoghaire that oysters are being brought in to treat the water. Can we get that on the north side as well? I have a mandate for that. It was on my four-pager. Oysters are great natural filters of E. coli and other contaminants."

Flood relief schemes are taking too long because the urgency is very real.",

We then have consequential compensation schemes and everything we try to do to alleviate the pressure but there is nothing worse than being the victim of a flooding incident. I will take a look at those schemes and talk to the Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW, Deputy Moran, to see how we can accelerate this. We are also looking at a critical infrastructure Bill and will see whether we can include wastewater and flood relief schemes.",
                    "Deputy Aindrias Moynihan raised the derogation and I fully agree with him that retaining the derogation is vital for farm families and for the food production system and the dairy industry. We need a sustainable farming industry but farmers are working with us on various water improvement schemes under the European Union framework and have being doing a lot to measure and assess this work. I have had discussions with the President of the European Commission explaining the unique position in Ireland because we have a pasture-based system that is outdoors more than indoors. Most other European systems are indoors. The Minister for agriculture, Deputy Heydon, has been working with Commissioner Roswall, who came to Ireland last week. She met farmers in Kildare and saw first-hand the measures we are taking to make farming and agriculture more sustainable. We know farmers do need to know. I take the Deputy's point in respect of other contributors to waste and I met representatives of Irish Water recently in the context of the Cabinet subcommittee meeting. Representatives from the Environmental Protection Agency were there as well. In my view, Irish Water has to get it right in respect of its own actions. It cannot contribute negatively to water quality, being a water body itself, nor can local authorities. They also certainly need to step up to the plate in protecting our waterways.",

Irish Water knows what its funding will be for the next five years, which should enable staff to get on, to plan and do things. There is a lot of work to be done. Our population is growing exponentially, and has grown during the past two decades. That is creating pressure on water services. What will be important as well, for those who correctly referenced wastewater treatment plants, is that we have to try to create a narrative and a consensus in society not to object to wastewater treatment plants, to their upgrade or to supply projects. An awful lot of these projects are getting snarled up in planning and being delayed for far too long. What is happening in the preparation of the schemes, stage III to stage IV, is that everybody is dotting the i's and crossing the t's because they are anticipating an objection or a judicial review so they want to make sure they can be resilient in the face of a court case being heard or a judicial review of a decision taken during the planning process. What we are getting is a very slow process in getting projects through. We will have to deal with that and the Government is determined to deal with that because we have to push ahead. Even on a small issue like apartment guidelines, and we had it earlier this afternoon during Leaders' Questions, we get public representatives judicially reviewing regulation. Then people complain about things not moving. We cannot have it our own way, every way, but that is a general comment on where we are and it is important.",

It is a very serious issue. E.coli levels are too high and when there is heavy rain. people cannot swim. That is not satisfactory. I am back to the issue that we need wastewater treatment plants. The whole Dublin water project is being judicially reviewed. The Arklow wastewater treatment plant was conceived at the same time as the Dublin scheme. It has opened - I opened it - and the Dublin scheme has not even gotten off the ground. There are other projects of that kind we need to get off the ground and to get going. The points were well made by Deputies Boyd Barrett and Heneghan in that regard.",

Deputy McGreehan in the first instance correctly identified that we are delivering results in respect of the shared island unit. It is practical and impactful. It is not about rhetoric. We have had rhetoric for 60 or 70 years and longer. It is about getting things done and delivering, and that is what we are doing. I take the point the Deputy made in respect of Dundalk IT and Queen's University. That is a very exciting development. It is a huge opportunity. Both institutions have to work now, as Deputy Ó Murchú said, to get the heads of agreement worked out and proper understanding for the benefit of students and staff. Deputy McGreehan has been a strong advocate of this. Deputy Ó Murchú has raised it as well. I have made it clear to the Minister, Deputy James Lawless, that I am supportive. I have no doubt that if the shared island unit gets a concrete proposal, it can respond positively. Obviously there is a lot more detailed work to be done. We need to do this properly, which is why the fund goes out to 2035. We do not need to rush things. We need to get them done properly and effectively so it is informed.",
                    "Deputy Devlin used the phrase \"practical people-focused projects\". This sums it up. No other Government since the foundation of the State has invested in Northern Ireland like this Government has. The shared island unit is a unique departure. It speaks far more than a lot of the rhetoric. I have been reading a lot about the 1940s, the 1950s and the 1960s. Some pretty good histories have been published recently on partition. Some good work has been done on all of this. Throughout the decades people spoke about four green fields, unity and all the rest of it but very little happened. We have come through 30 years of horrific violence, which was unnecessary in my view. We have an opportunity now. People are entitled to their constitutional positions. There is no issue there. There is nothing stopping any political party, by the way, from advancing a detailed blueprint. I have yet to see one. There is nothing stopping any political party doing this but we can come back to it on another day."

                "I attended a meeting of the European Council on 23 October in Brussels. The substantial items on the agenda included support for Ukraine, the situation in the Middle East, European security and defence, competitiveness and the green and digital transitions. Leaders also had a first strategic discussion on housing and the Euro Summit. Migration was also discussed, as well as Moldova following its recent parliamentary elections. I will deal with Ukraine, the Middle East, European security and defence, housing and competitiveness. The Minister of State, Deputy Byrne, will later speak to all other issues.",
                "Almost four years after Russia launched its full-scale and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, President Putin repeatedly shows us that he is intent on disregarding alternatives to his chosen path of needless and brutal war. Support for Ukraine in the face of this aggression continues to be a top priority for the European Union and was a key focus of the October European Council. President Zelenskyy, who attended in person, briefed us on the current situation and recent developments in Ukraine, including Russia's escalation in strikes on civilians and civilian infrastructure. These attacks have continued since.",
                "I and my fellow European Union leaders reconfirmed the European Union's unwavering support for Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders. The European Council recommitted the European Union to providing, in co-ordination with like-minded partners and allies, comprehensive political, financial, economic, humanitarian, military and diplomatic support to Ukraine and its people. The European Union has provided substantial assistance to Ukraine to enable it to defend itself against Russia's ongoing aggression and to support the people of Ukraine to withstand the terrible effects of Russia's indiscriminate attacks.",
                "Ukraine requires our help now even more urgently and at an even greater scale. With this in mind, leaders discussed how the EU can help to step up military and other supports for Ukraine, and apply greater pressure on Russia to agree to an unconditional ceasefire and engage in a meaningful peace process.",
                "The European Council also considered how the European Union can contribute to security guarantees for Ukraine as part of any future peace agreement, working with the United States and other partners as part of the coalition of the willing. The European Council also welcomed the adoption of the 19th package of European Union sanctions against Russia. Our sanctions are having an impact - it is important to say that - and we must continue to maintain this pressure on Russia. Russia should be held accountable for its actions and should have to pay for the destruction it has caused. There must be an economic cost to such flagrant violations of international law. Such a cost should also act as a deterrent to Russia and other countries contemplating any future violation of the UN Charter and international law.",
                "To this end, the European Council discussed the further use of immobilised Russian assets as well as their use to provide reparation loans to Ukraine to finance its needs at this critical point in its fight against Russia’s aggression. Ireland supports the European Union's initiative for reparation loans. We agree that it must be in line with applicable laws and should be undertaken in co-ordination with international partners. As agreed by the European Council, the European Commission has presented options on how best to meet Ukraine’s financing needs in a sustainable and comprehensive way. These options will now be fully considered by EU member states with a view to reaching a decision on the way forward at the meeting of the European Council in December.",
                "The European Council also called for further measures to disrupt the operation of Russia’s shadow fleet, which is helping Russia to circumvent sanctions and finance its war. Action in this area is also important to address the significant environmental and security risks the shadow fleet poses. Ireland supports European Union efforts to further counter the shadow fleet. Ireland has always been a strong supporter of Ukraine’s ambition of EU membership and I continue to advocate at European level for progress on Ukraine’s EU accession. EU membership must be part of a comprehensive package of security guarantees for Ukraine. I am deeply frustrated by Hungary’s blocking of progress in Ukraine’s European Union accession process. Ireland will continue to work with our partners in the EU to find a way to unblock and accelerate this process to match the ambition and efforts of Ukraine in implementing the required reforms.",
                "Turning to the Middle East, the European Council met against the backdrop of a new era of hope for the people of Gaza. It is a fragile ceasefire, but a ceasefire nonetheless. European Union leaders welcomed the agreement reached on the first phase of the comprehensive plan to end the Gaza conflict put forward by President Trump and commended the diplomatic efforts led by the United States and the role played by the regional mediators, which the European Union has consistently supported. European leaders recalled the high-level conference for the peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine and the implementation of the two-state solution and reiterated the European Union's commitment to international law and to a comprehensive, just and lasting peace, based on the two-State solution.",
                "An important aspect of our discussions was the role that the European Union can play to contribute to peace efforts and to actively engage with partners on the next steps. These will include supporting the rapid, safe and unhindered delivery of humanitarian aid in co-ordination with international partners, the reintroduction of the European Union's border assistance mission to the Rafah crossing point, EUBAM Rafah, and the European Union police mission for the Palestinian territories. These are important contributions to Gaza’s stabilisation, transitional governance, recovery and reconstruction. The European Union's support for the Palestinian Authority is crucial. European Union leaders called on Israel to release withheld clearance revenues necessary to ensure that the proper functioning of the Palestinian Authority and the delivery of essential services to the population happens. In this regard, Ireland has joined the emergency coalition for the financial sustainability of the Palestinian Authority and will attend the first meeting of the Palestine Donor Group later this week. The European Council also stressed the importance of de-escalation in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and called for an end to settler violence and the expansion of settlements, which are illegal under international law, and an end to Israel’s military operation. It called for an end to all of those. We also called on Israel to reverse the E1 settlement plan that further undermines the two-state solution. Ireland has been clear that the West Bank must be centrally considered as efforts continue to reach agreement on a durable peace plan with the implementation of the two-State solution at its core. We welcomed the inclusion of the developments in Lebanon and Syria in the European Council conclusions. Events in these countries challenge regional stability and require continued European focus.",
                "The European Council reverted to the topic of European security and defence. President von der Leyen and High Representative Kallas presented the Commission’s Preserving Peace - Defence Readiness Roadmap 2030. The main elements of the roadmap include addressing capability development through member states' capability coalitions, flagship projects, strengthening industrial capacities and supporting Ukraine's defence capabilities. The roadmap is an important contribution to enhance Europe's defence readiness to respond to real and emerging threats, not least from Russia. Ireland will continue to engage constructively in discussions around the priority capability areas that have been identified.",
                "I made it clear that Ireland is determined to step up our own security, to confront new threats and to protect the well-being of our citizens and our economies. European countries, including Ireland, are investing more in their national security and defence capabilities. Each is doing so in a way that makes sense for its own particular situation, policy approach and the specific characteristics of the foreign policy of every member state. In Ireland’s case, that is and will remain a policy of military neutrality. However, there are synergies that we can achieve through working together at EU level in a way that complements what we are doing at national level. The international security environment continues to deteriorate and to be contested, dynamic and volatile. The EU is acting with greater decisiveness, ambition and speed to tackle the threats we face. Ireland must be a part of this process because it is in our interests to do so as an active member of the European Union and because such threats put at risk the values we hold dear as Europeans.",
                "Following the debate in this House on the previous European Council meeting, I was somewhat concerned that Members opposite in this House accused Europe of warmongering and described Europe as having a military industrial complex. I could not comprehend such a detached view. The fear in European Union member states is a very real one. They really fear Russian aggression and Russian undermining of their political systems and their economies. We just have to look at what happened in Poland during the week, in terms of more arson attacks, hybrid attacks and so on.",
                "Improving Europe’s competitiveness is also crucial for our security and vice versa. The October European Council meeting set further important orientations on strengthening Europe’s economic competitiveness and unlocking the full potential of the Single Market, including a particular focus on regulatory simplification. The European Council reaffirmed the urgent need to advance an ambitious and horizontally driven simplification and better regulation agenda at all levels, consistent with protecting high standards and the integrity of the Single Market. Leaders welcomed the progress achieved on the six omnibus simplification packages already presented by the Commission in the first half of the year, and called on the Council and the Parliament to swiftly conclude their work on the remaining elements. Leaders also called on the Commission to bring forward proposals across a range of specific areas. This includes proposing, without delay, an optional 28th company law regime, allowing companies to scale up, as well as further ambitious simplification packages in the financial services, transport, energy, digital and food safety areas. The European Council also called on the Commission to intensify efforts to stress-test the EU acquis, including exploring new proposals to streamline and accelerate planning and permitting procedures for infrastructure development.",
                "I strongly welcome the broad-based political agreement we have established on the need for continued efforts at all levels to ensure a clear, simple and smart innovation- and SME-friendly regulatory framework. Leaders also held a strategic discussion on how to progress the green transition in a way that supports and drives European competitiveness. As I made clear during Ireland’s national statement at COP30 in Belém, Brazil, climate change is no longer a distant threat - it is a daily reality and we are all feeling its consequences. I also expressed the serious concern that the spirit of common purpose is weakening. There are other threats and crises that can seem more pressing, including geopolitical turbulence, economic pressures, conflict and dislocations, but global temperatures are rising and the clock is ticking. Decarbonisation and sustainability are central to Ireland and the EU’s competitiveness and the well-being of our people.",
                "Following guidance provided by the European Council, an ambitious greenhouse gas reduction target for 2040 was agreed by environment Ministers ahead of COP30.",
                "These were difficult discussions and I welcome the fact the final agreement reflects the importance of food security, forestry, land use, renewable energy and a just transition, including energy affordability.",
                "Meeting existing and future EU targets is very challenging but Ireland must continue to be part of that effort. At a global level, we will continue to provide climate finance and continue our support for small island developing states. I was delighted to announce at COP30 a new UNDP project office to be hosted in Dublin, dedicated to advancing sustainable finance.",
                "For the first time ever, European Union leaders held a strategic discussion on housing. I welcome the opportunity for such a discussion as it reflects the challenges being experienced in many EU member states. While housing remains a national competence, there are steps we can take at EU level to better support member states in addressing the crisis. This includes the upcoming European Affordable Housing Plan, the aim of which is to support and complement member states in their efforts to address their respective housing challenges. We are managing our particular housing difficulties in a context of very strong population growth, rapid urbanisation, an infrastructure and housing supply deficit, as well as construction cost inflation and affordability challenges.",
                "The Government’s new housing plan, Delivering Homes, Building Communities: An Action Plan on Housing Supply and Targeting Homelessness, is ambitious. We are creating the conditions to enable a step-up in private sector delivery while trying to break down the barriers that are holding back construction; to support people directly in securing a home of their own; and to support renters and tackle homelessness. The challenges differ across EU member states with varying root causes. In the discussion among leaders, I stressed the point that there is no one-size-fits-all solution. I underlined that the European Affordable Housing Plan should have a strong focus on addressing affordability and viability challenges. Ireland's ranking is very high in terms of supply and delivery across Europe.",
                "I strongly support the incorporation of affordable housing in the EU’s simplification agenda to support the delivery of affordable housing. I would be in favour of a review of the impact of existing EU legislation and policies on housing delivery. There is also merit in a pan-European investment platform that would help to develop innovative funding methods for social and affordable housing providers, helping to attract private investment. I also called for stronger co-operation at EU level in the elimination of homelessness, which is a key national priority for Ireland. Leaders will return to many of these issues to assess progress and discuss further actions at future meetings of the European Council.",
                "This meeting of the European Council was very busy, addressing many pressing issues that are of vital importance to our people and to the future of the European Union. As Taoiseach, and as a Government, we will continue to ensure that Ireland plays a very active and positive role at the heart of the European Union. This will take on even more significance as we take on the Presidency of the EU in the second half of 2026 when it will be our responsibility to drive this ambitious agenda."

                "I want to take the opportunity to condemn the Russian attack on Ukraine last night. The latest reports are that at least 20 people have been killed, including two children, in a Russian drone and missile attack on the western city of Ternopil that hit two blocks of flats. Another 66 people were injured, 16 of them were children, in one of the deadliest Russian attacks on western Ukraine since the full-scale war began in February 2022. Yesterday evening we had statements on Ukraine, in which I had the opportunity to outline in detail my views and position and those of my party on Ukraine. I will try to cover some other issues today. For the record, I want to reiterate Sinn Féin's solidarity with the people of Ukraine in the face of Russia's brutal invasion of their country and condemn the attacks we have seen in the past 48 hours.",
                "The scenes we are seeing from Sudan, in particular EI Fasher, are horrifying and appalling. Tens of thousands of people are unaccounted for. We have seen huge numbers of civilian casualties as the RSF forces have gained control of the city and surrounding areas. I have been raising concerns for a number of months in the Dáil with the Tánaiste and the then Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Harris, at the situation in El Fasher and Darfur, the inability to get humanitarian aid into the city and our concerns for the civilian population. This situation has since escalated very significantly and the world can no longer avert its eyes from what is happening in Sudan. Tens of thousands of people have reached safer places. However, tens of thousands of people are still unaccounted for in a city of about 100,000 people. There is huge concern as to their welfare. People were being cut down in the street and slaughtered in cold blood. This is one of the largest humanitarian crises in the world. More than a year and a half of siege warfare made this one of the most horrific places in the world and among the world's worst humanitarian crises.",
                "The flow of weapons continues into Sudan in which the United Arab Emirates is complicit. There are credible reports that the United Arab Emirates is arming the RSF. The European Union has very strong connections and ties with the United Arab Emirates. The EU needs to step up and put pressure on the UAE to stop the flow of weapons into Sudan and to hold it to account for its complicity in this dreadful conflict.",
                "On Palestine, we have just had a substantial debate on the Occupied Territories Bill. What we have witnessed in Gaza and in the West Bank is utterly horrifying. The widespread nature of severe malnutrition in Gaza and the effective starvation of much of the population, in particular children, has been nothing short of horrific, a living hell for the people of Gaza. It is worth highlighting once again that, unfortunately, at European Union level, we have seen how Ursula von der Leyen's unconditional and unqualified support for Benjamin Netanyahu at a pivotal point provided political cover for the genocidal destruction that followed. These partisan interventions have damaged the credibility of the EU. There is now a need for action. I welcome that more countries are now considering the suspension of the EU-Israel association agreement. That is the minimum the EU should be doing.",
                "We are now at a point where the existence of the Palestinian people, in particular the ability to deliver an independent Palestine as part of a two-state solution, is very much at stake. There was much discussion in the Taoiseach's speech in regard to the two-state solution and the formulas of words that exist. However, we have had 20 years of formulas of words, positions, statements and so on, and all the while the West Bank has become nearly like Swiss cheese in terms of the extent to which it has been pock-marked by more settlements, undermining the viability of the West Bank to exist as a political entity. We now have a so-called ceasefire but dozens of people are still being killed. If we want to avoid further conflict and escalation in the future, there needs to be a stable and sustainable political solution. That has to mean a viable Palestinian entity and a pathway to self-determination for the Palestinian people.",
                "In our view, actions such as enacting the occupied territories Bill remain necessary in terms of consistency with international law and of exerting maximum pressure on Israel to enter into and abide by political peace agreements. Spain and Slovenia have already taken the lead in this regard. The new Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Helen McEntee, needs to be proactive on this and, after years of delay, needs to follow the lead of these two EU member states.",
                "In regard to the Presidency of the Council of the European Union from July to December 2026, this is a major opportunity for our country. It is an opportunity to promote Irish interests abroad, to improve our country, to make it a better place in which to live, work and to attract investment. It will also be an opportunity to raise key issues of Irish foreign policy, including the devastating cuts to overseas development aid. However, concerns have been raised in recent days among Irish and European military leaders in relation to Ireland’s ability to resource security operations during the upcoming EU Presidency. This is completely and utterly down to this Government and its predecessors in how they have completely neglected our Defence Forces. They have allowed the Defence Forces to become depleted. It is an absolute disgrace that the Government has left us in this vulnerable position and that events around the EU Presidency could be exposed due to a lack of capability, particularly in relation to tackling drones but also our ability to monitor and police our own waters. The reality that we still do not have a full radar picture is an indictment of successive governments.",
                "This argument should not only apply to the EU Presidency. The neglect of our Defence Forces over the years has resulted in our not being able to police our waters and our skies and being seen as a soft touch for major international drug cartels. In Sinn Féin's view, an Irish Government should be strong on neutrality and strong on defence. This Government is strong on neither of those. We have had the embarrassing situation where ships have been put to sea with no functioning main gun because of a lack of specialist staff to deliver that. Our Defence Forces are effectively at rock bottom in terms of morale and seriously struggling in terms of recruitment and retention.",

It goes without saying it is not much of a peace plan if it does not lead to the end of the deaths of Palestinians.. More than 70,000 people have been slaughtered in Gaza and there have been attempts at greater levels of annexation in the West Bank. As for Smotrich and Ben-Gvir, in fairness, they are brutally honest about what they are offering up, and that is about ensuring there is no room for a Palestinian state. Beyond that, they would like to see a huge number of those Palestinians displaced by whatever means. I am not sure they are particularly worried about the means. We need to stand firm. It is a disgrace that the EU-Israel association agreement is still standing at this point. Pressure needs to be maintained. It goes without saying we must move on the occupied territories Bill.",

I attended the Party of European Socialists' summit in Amsterdam just last month, where we developed policies and a programme for change, in particular focusing on those issues of housing and climate.",

There is now a special committee on housing, and Aodhán is the S&D group rapporteur on that. For the first time, there is now a housing Commissioner at EU level, which the Minister is well-aware of, in Dan Jørgensen, the Commissioner for energy and housing. A key priority is to ensure we can see reform of state aid rules in order that homes can be built at the scale so badly needed through the deployment of state investment. We have called for a common housing policy, just as we have a Common Agricultural Policy. We must now see Europe-wide action to tackle housing and ensure better levels of state intervention.",

It is not just stronger action to tackle climate change for its own sake, because through a just transition we can also see a new green industrial revolution and the creation of hundreds of thousands of new jobs through the roll-out of wind energy and solar power through emerging technologies. I welcome the appointment of a socialist commissioner, Teresa Ribera, who is now the Commissioner for a Clean, Just and Competitive Transition. She is pushing hard at EU level for change on climate.",

I reiterate how disappointed most people in Ireland were at the lack of action taken by the EU to ensure accountability by Israel for its brutal genocide on the people of Gaza. There are clear steps the EU can and should take, even at this late stage, such as the suspension in full of the EU-Israel association agreement, tougher trade sanctions and a complete arms embargo, in particular. In Ireland, of course, we can and should be passing the occupied territories Bill in full to cover trade and services by Christmas. It is instructive that the Government did not see fit to oppose the Opposition motion that was passed earlier in this House, and in doing so, it has signed up again to passage of the Bill. We in the Opposition will continue to hold the Government to account on that.",
                "On workers' rights and the adequate minimum wage directive, just last week, the European Court of Justice issued its judgment upholding the EU directive. This was nothing short of a landmark moment for workers' rights and I welcome it. Fair pay is at the heart of the European social model, the model that we, the S&D group and the Party of European Socialists have been pushing for. We have also been pushing for formal, statutory recognition of collective bargaining. We need to see decisive measures to accompany that to expand collective bargaining coverage and improve rights for those who are members of unions. We welcome the fact the Government finally published its collective bargaining action plan earlier this month, but the Government will be judged by the concrete actions it takes. Here in Ireland, just four in ten workers are covered by collective agreements. This is far below the EU average and just half the 80% benchmark required by the directive. What concrete steps will the Government be taking to ensure we close the gap to the threshold and see that directive implemented in full?",

Did the Taoiseach make opposition on these grounds clear at the European Council? Is the Government working with like-minded member states to ensure that this deal does not proceed at this late stage?"

Indeed, it was the focus of some of the debates in the presidential election and it was said flippantly in one of those debates that it could be just a symbolic Bill. It is important that it be far more than that. If the occupied territories Bill is to have full effect, there should be some European-wide approach.

They should have shame and historic hang-ups about that but those hang-ups should not determine how they govern and the right actions to be taken for humanity in the year 2025. It is reprehensible that some European countries continue to stifle and block things that should happen in Gaza and the Middle East to restore peace and, more important, protect humanity there. I do not think Ireland, Spain and some other countries have been found wanting but I hope there will be a common position. The more that people can see the suffering there, the more their conscience should be attuned to what should happen, rather than what happened 70 years ago and how wrong that was. Things need to be done right in the year 2025.",
                "In terms of the war in Ukraine, I join others in condemning the ramping-up of acts of aggression against humanity in Ukraine in the past couple of days. I do not believe President Putin is a man who wants peace. He has totally played other leaders in peace negotiations for what he really wants out of them. He is hellbent on getting more territory. It seems his country, economically at least, will be able to see out this war. For that reason, it is important that the European Union bloc significantly ramps up restrictions and sanctions on Russia. Frozen financial assets and aircraft confiscated during the early days of the war should be seen as European assets that can be used to fund humanitarian efforts in Ukraine. I do not think they should be held in reserve indefinitely.",
                "Ireland in the early days and months of the war was proud to play a major role in providing accommodation to beneficiaries of temporary protection. At one point, 3,000 or 4,000 Ukrainian refugees who had fled war in their country lived in County Clare and that was replicated throughout the country. In preparing for today's speech, I looked and discovered that Ukraine is a very broad and wide country. From the west to the east, it measures 893 km as the crow flies. From Dublin, 893 km would take in cities like Bordeaux and Genoa. If there was conflict in Genoa or Bordeaux, I would like to think Dublin would be somewhat safe and removed from that. As the war in Ukraine continues, attacks happen in various cities. It is not all in the eastern flank of the country but it is important that the European Union reflect on the temporary protection directive and refine it geographically. I do not know if someone who is 893 km from the front line requires the same level of protection within the EU bloc as someone living on the eastern flank. The war has gone on a lot longer than everyone expected and that should be a discussion point at this time.",
                "Ireland will host the EU Presidency next year. With that comes great pride in our country. There are certain policy areas we can lead out on. I had a good meeting with the Minister of State last week to discuss some of those areas. With this also comes risk. In the past 24 hours, a Russian spy ship, as it has been dubbed, has been carrying out surveillance in British territorial waters and is tracking in a southerly direction from Scotland towards Wales. It is being tracked all the time by the British Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. Lasers have been used from the ship to blind the eyes of pilots trying to track it. It is important during our Presidency of the European Union that we have increased capacity to patrol our territorial waters and ensure Ireland, Inc. and the European Union are safe and defended from rogue elements and the Russian defence forces, which are quite malignant forces at the moment.",
                "This Government is committed to ramping up investment in the Defence Forces but it is a big ask for any country to match the might of a superpower. It is important that we look at new forms of technology to track what is off our shore and how safe our undersea cables are. I ask the Minister of State to visit the centre for robotic and intelligent systems, CRIS, operating out of the University of Limerick. It is incredible what they have there. They have undersea drones capable of going 300 km or 400 km off the Irish coast. They can be manned and controlled from shore and have the ability to track gas leaks, interference, bad actors at sea and what they might be trying to do to our undersea network of cables and infrastructure. This is far cheaper than commissioning new frigates for the Naval Service or having more aircraft patrolling our skies. There is a whole space here that other countries have embraced but that we, as a nation, have not embraced yet. I recently attended a conference in the University of Limerick that brought the Commissioners of Irish Lights, the Naval Service and stakeholders from the offshore wind energy sector together in one room. I had discovered before I left that we are the laggards in Europe. Every other European Union country has a national laboratory for robotic excellence but we do not have one in Ireland. It is a relatively cheap, modern and innovative way to monitor our territorial waters and our skies and protect our country from bad actors. We need to embrace the idea of a national laboratory for robotics and all that could do.",
                "Others have mentioned the Mercosur deal and it is something I have been following quite closely in recent months. I will give my slant on it. In the interests of transparency, I have to declare I am a suckler farmer in County Clare. Beef prices have never been as high. Many farmers would say it is not that prices have spiked but that farmers are being paid what they should rightly be paid. It is probably a stabilising of the market that we have never seen before. If the fear is unwarranted, that needs to be clarified by Government, but there is a real fear among farmers that prices will be destabilised if there is a signing-up to the Mercosur deal. I would like to know how Mercosur would be ratified. I think it requires a simple majority decision to sign up to it."

They state, \"The European Council welcomes the agreement reached on the first phase of the Comprehensive Plan to end the Gaza Conflict put forward by President Trump\". The minutes went on to call on \"all parties to fully commit to implementing all phases and to refrain from any actions that jeopardise the agreement\". The ceasefire in Gaza has been in place for five weeks. This is not a ceasefire that operates as I or ordinary people would expect. Since the ceasefire, hundreds of Palestinians have been killed, according to the Gaza health authorities. Much of Gaza remains under Israeli military control. Humanitarian organisations argue much of Gaza is still suffering as a result of insufficient aid coming in and talks of lasting peace have somewhat stalled. The number of Israeli strikes across Gaza has decreased but they have not stopped altogether. A ceasefire to me means that firing simply ceases. Last Thursday, the Palestinian health authority said 260 Palestinian people have been killed and 632 injured since the ceasefire began. Is this really a ceasefire? Among the civilians murdered and injured in recent weeks are dozens of innocent men, women, children and elderly Palestinians. Collective punishment of the Palestinian people by Israel has not ceased. We need the European Council to call out Israel's ongoing and blatant disregard of the ceasefire, and not only that, but to place real sanctions on Israel.",
                "This morning, we had a debate on a collective Opposition motion on the occupied territories Bill. The Government did not oppose the motion, but not opposing something and supporting it are two different things. My problem is that during my time in the House, the Government has been a serial offender in breaking its commitments and promises. I am simply asking that the Government keep its promise in this regard and pass the occupied territories Bill in its entirety, not in a watered-down manner. As we speak, Israel continues to act with impunity. There has to be accountability and passing the occupied territories Bill is a necessary step for the Irish Government if it wants to be taken seriously at all about its commitment to uphold international law and human rights.",
                "I welcome one line in the statements of the European Council, where it stresses the importance of the de-escalation in the West Bank and calls for an end to settler violence. What the occupied territories Bill aims to do is sanction Israel for illegal land grabs of Palestinian land, which cannot go unpunished. One thing I am really concerned about at the moment is the lack of media focus on Palestine. It used to be the first thing on the news. My concern is that when eyes are not on Gaza and Palestine, Israel will continue to act with impunity and to inflict genocide on the Palestinian people. I am very concerned about that."

I extend my solidarity and that of the Social Democrats to all those affected by these latest acts in Russia's illegal war of aggression. Now more than ever, in particular in advance of our Presidency of the EU next year, it is crucial that Ireland assert itself at EU level on the issues we hold dear. Being a good European or member state does not mean being an uncritical one. That often gets lost in the discourse, but it is particularly important when we want to fight for a European Union that supports social cohesion, protects citizens from big industry and big tech harms and fulfils its original promise of being a peace project. Ireland can play a powerful role in making Europe stand up for these principles and I have serious concerns that when it comes to defence, corporate regulation, the Mercosur trade agreement and the erosion of a social Europe, we are not raising our voice to an adequate volume. We cannot go with the flow on these issues if we want a Europe that works for everyone.",
                "In particular, I raise the status of any discussions at EU Council level on the digital omnibus and Ireland's position on it. A very serious piece of business that has recently passed through the European Parliament is the omnibus package on the corporate sustainability due diligence directive, on which Fine Gael MEPs allied with the far right to row back laws that guaranteed that slavery, child labour and environmental crimes would be kept out of our supply chains. In response to my party colleague Senator Stephenson, a commitment was made in the Seanad by the Minister of State, Deputy Richmond, that the Irish Government would defend the four pillars of the directive, which are due diligence duty, an EU-wide civil liability regime, climate transition plan implementation and stakeholder engagement. It is unfortunate that he did not communicate the Government's position to his party colleagues in Europe. Now we have a potential omnibus deregulation package that, from the leaked draft, looks as though it is poised to dismantle data protection rules and the AI Act in a similar way, at a time when ordinary people want us to protect their data and to protect them from AI harms. Have the Minister of State and his colleagues raised this at EU Council level? Will the Irish Government defend us from further deregulation of big tech?",
                "It has become clear in recent weeks that the Commission is out of its depth when it comes to understanding AI and is parroting industry lines that have no basis in reality. More than 200 scholars and scientists were so concerned about the rhetoric of the President of the Commission that they asked President von der Leyen to retract her comments. We cannot allow the tail to wag the dog on regulation of technology that can pose a threat to our democracies, health, communities, livelihoods and ability to trust the images and words put in front of us. If Ireland wants to be a leader in this space, we must defend the rights of our citizens at EU Council level.",
                "On the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, we need to see a system that delivers for member states, protects our future and ensures EU funding and support is directed at things that improve people's lives and support regional development and the cohesion of our societies. Particularly concerning are the plans for this MFF to be used to build a European defence union. This is not bluster or exaggeration; it is the exact wording from the Commission. While we talk about foreign affairs and defence being national competences, we sit idly by as EU funds, which Ireland contributes to, will spend five times more on defence, including unprecedented investment in the arms industry. Irish taxpayer money will be used to give handouts to arms manufacturers. While arms manufacturers can sell their goods to European countries, they also supply Israel and many other global actors with their weapons of war.",
                "I am deeply concerned that we are seeing the EU come closer and closer to a defence union and that the narrowing of the definition of neutrality by this Government is serving the express purpose of sleepwalking the Irish people into exactly that. This is against the express will of the Irish people. I understand that other countries in Europe have different views on defence and neutrality from ours. That is why there are defence organisations for them, which Ireland is not a part of. This is even more of a reason that we need the Irish Government to resist the shift of the European Union into a defence union. I want to know whether this Government is taking this shift seriously and is willing to stand up for a Europe that is not a defence union, which is what people wanted us to do when they voted for the Nice and Lisbon treaties.",
                "My final point is about sanctions. A key provision in this Council meeting was the suspension of visa-free travel for particular groups or nationalities and human rights violations are cited as a possible ground for suspension. Has the Government given any thought to its use for those implicated in genocide in Gaza and those setting up and living in illegal settlements in the West Bank? Did it raise expanding the sanctions regime, particularly as the proposals brought by Ursula von der Leyen to do so are still on the table? We have seen a dragging of heels on action at EU level and it is particularly vital, first and foremost, that the EU sanctions regime be expanded beyond the approximately 100 settlers, in recognition that all settlers in the West Bank are violating international law. In the absence of that, we need to push for action using every possible lever available to us and I encourage the Irish Government to do so.",

The Hague preferences were created precisely for countries like ours that are highly dependent, acutely exposed and have long been denied fair treatment.

People are deeply uneasy about the steady political drift towards military alignment being pushed by a small group of commentators and politicians with a clear agenda. Neutrality is neither symbolic nor outdated. It is the backbone of our independent foreign policy, peacekeeping credibility and capacity to act as honest brokers in a world defined by conflict. People see what is happening with the softened language, blurred commitments and the slow normalisation of military integration. The Government must end the ambiguity and reaffirm that neutrality is not optional. It is a democratic mandate and demands protection.",

Twice in recent months, hundreds of retired EU and European diplomats have made the legal position unmistakable. When the EU fails to act on sanctions - and it has failed catastrophically; it has looked humanity in the eye and failed it - member states can, and are obliged to, act unilaterally or with willing partners. Ireland cannot hide behind collective paralysis. The Government can no longer wring its hands and say, \"Europe will not move so we cannot either\". If the EU will not impose sanctions, Ireland must.",

Interestingly, when we are apparently sending off our Minister for Finance to the World Bank, I just looked up Sudan's debt, which is 70% of its GDP. Maybe the ex-Minister might have a word in the ear of the World Bank. Imagine that we are fund-raising for Sudan when it is crippled with debt to western governments. Over two years, we have seen this conflict escalate, most recently with the RSF. The RSF has been encouraged by the EU traditionally. It was involved in the migration process or the Khartoum process. It has also helped to shape some of the proponents of the genocide. The genocide has killed about 150,000 people and 12 million people have been displaced.",

It is absolutely critical that we end the chokehold of colonial and regional powers over Sudan. The Sudanese people had a brave revolution in 2018 and 2019. Both sides, the army and the RSF, are partners in crime against that revolution. They drowned it in blood and ensured that it would not go forward. I want to identify the UAE in particular. It did not want a democratic regime in that area. It did not want a successful revolution to send a message to others in that area, and that is behind this.

We witnessed it unfold over the past few days when the British Government announced that it was going to implement a Danish-style asylum system, cracking down further on already very limited rights of people to asylum, with the Labour Party Government dancing to the tune of Nigel Farage. That was followed immediately by a statement from the Minister for justice, Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, who said he is aware of these changes in the UK and committed to ensuring that Ireland is not viewed more favourably. He said he will monitor the changes in the UK to make appropriate changes here. We have reached a situation where, effectively, Nigel Farage is writing Irish migration policy. Nigel Farage calls for something, the Labour Party jumps in Britain and now the Minister jumps after that. It is disgusting. It is a policy that is marked by performative cruelty. It is cruelty that does not make life any better for any ordinary person in this country. It does not build one more house or make one more house available. It does not deal with our crisis in public services or anything else. It just makes life harder for the most vulnerable people.",

The Government is now saying that even though we say it is not safe for them, we are not going to allow their children or their partners to join them, even though, clearly, they are very unlikely to be safe either. It is a horrifically cruel policy.",

The reality is that the European Court of Human Rights has found that Denmark violated the right to family life under the European Convention on Human Rights. The European Court of Justice accused Denmark of racial discrimination. Refugees have spoken about feeling that integration is pointless because they are effectively not allowed to integrate. I do not suspect the Minister of State cares about any of that, but maybe look at the election results. Denmark's Social Democrats just took a hammering because people who oppose racism voted for parties to their left and they have lost control of Copenhagen as a result of parties to their left. They have lost other voters to their right, which they have legitimised.

The Commission has been tasked with a comprehensive and ambitious housing plan. There will also be a European housing summit in 2026. We need to reflect on that as a Government but also as a Parliament, between the Dáil, Seanad and society, that the challenges we face in housing are not solely located here in Ireland.

The key focuses were on Ukraine, the so-called Middle East peace process, defence readiness, competitiveness, the energy transition, digital sovereignty, migration and the ongoing enlargement process. I have a couple of comments to make on those.",

I welcome that an exchange of views took place with President Zelenskyy. As I said last night, he is very welcome and we are looking forward to his visit in December. I suggested last night that there is no long-term tangible commitment that would replace the wavering US support. Ukraine is in a very tenuous position. A lot of platitudes have been given to it from an EU perspective. Aside from some of the Baltic states and the other states on the border, we are not seeing the commitments that are required, although I welcome France's recent announcement.",

The EU, for historic reasons within various member states, is not willing to collectively call out the Israeli genocide. There were meaningful, worthy references to the peace process and to EU missions, and a call for Israel to release withheld revenues, but nothing that is going to force Israel to do anything meaningful. Collectively, the countries that have shown a little bravery such as Ireland, Norway, Belgium and Spain will have to do more in a co-ordinated way on this issue.",

I want to know how the roadmap for defence readiness 2030 ties in with our military neutrality. I will read the Minister of State's speech later. Obviously, we have to develop our defensive capabilities, especially with regard to Russian threats off our coast. We should be able to report that we are increasing spending on our defences without it being part of a collective EU pact.",

I would still see that we are not putting in the long-term investment in our own infrastructure.

There have been threats to the environmental aspect in other parts of European affairs. Does he believe the commitment to decarbonisation is continuing?"

It beggars belief that, at a time of serious conversation around climate change, beef that has been raised on South American land where trees have been felled and ecosystems have been destroyed is to be brought thousands of miles to this country and the rest of Europe to supplant Irish beef that is produced to a far higher environmental standard. This is at a time one third of farmers are earning a living off the farm, one third are only making a living because they are also doing another job and the remaining third are in poverty. It is absolutely incredible. Where does the Government stand on this issue? From what I can see, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are speaking out both sides of their mouths on the issue of Mercosur. Neither farmers nor I have confidence that the Government will use every available lever to ensure that this deal is ended. Will the Minister of State make a clear declaration, without any equivocation, that this Government will end its passive attitude towards Mercosur and ensure it does not pass? Will he make arrangements and alliances with other European countries with similar views so we can put an end to this threat to Irish farmers?"

We need it to end for our financial and economic security, as well as our own security in general. We want that war to end. The EU must continue to put as much leverage - I again use that word \"leverage\" - on Russia. There were serious efforts at and around the European Council to put huge pressure on Russia to end this and that work continues. The war is costing Ukrainians their lives and homes. The destruction there is absolutely unbelievable. There are quite a number of Members who have visited Ukraine. I have visited myself. It is absolutely frightening. I would like to think that if it happened to us, we would have the same help from other member states. That is what solidarity is about. It was necessary to do that at the time. We want this to end because it is costing a lot of money. There is no question about that. Let us end it and save lives."

We saw the SAFE mechanism recently, which Ireland certainly facilitated.

What is happening in many eastern European countries is that choices are being made, choices supported by entire parliaments, to spend more on defence and maybe less on social spending. These are really difficult choices but, quite frankly, countries like Finland, Lithuania and Poland feel backed into a corner that they have to do this because of that serious threat from Russia."

The October European Council adopted certain conclusions on strengthening and protecting the digital ecosystem, including through reinforced international partnerships and close collaboration with trusted partner countries and international organisations on digital innovation and governance. Leaders stressed the need to address the risks related to hybrid threats and cybersecurity, as well as reducing strategic dependencies. This includes the need to diversify EU sources of critical raw materials, advance the roll-out of connectivity infrastructure, deepen the Single Market for electronic communications and promote the development and deployment of sustainable digital systems. Leaders also stressed the importance of protecting minors in the digital space. The European Council also welcomed the recent Commission initiatives on artificial intelligence, AI, and quantum technology, and it urged a high level of ambition in the forthcoming proposals on the EU cloud and AI development.",
                "On migration, there are challenges. This issue is now a standing item on the European Council agenda. Leaders welcomed an update from the Commission President on migration patterns and the actions the Commission is taking in response. Ireland believes Europe must address the shared challenge of unplanned migration through collective effort. We have always supported a predictable and flexible system of responsibility and solidarity regarding the reception and management of protection applications. We know well the major burden that front-line states and, indeed, most member states, have borne in recent years. Ireland has long advocated that this crucial issue needs to be addressed based on strong solidarity and responsibility among member states. The EU migration and asylum pact represents a necessary improvement on the current protection system, as well as a new dawn of burden sharing across the EU. We would like to see sustainable progress on irregular migration, including returns, ideally based on genuine partnerships with countries of origin and transit and a common European asylum system, but one that complies with international law and respect for fundamental rights.",
                "The Republic of Moldova was also discussed. That country had a recent parliamentary election and it safeguarded the integrity of its democracy in the face of Russian interference. This Russian interference in Moldova was absolutely off the scale in terms of the amount of money it spent, but it did not succeed. The EU leaders rightly commended Moldova’s achievement. Ireland views the lessons learned in Moldova as vital to countering Russia’s hybrid activity for all of us. Our support for Moldova's EU accession remains solid. As Ireland's EU Presidency approaches, we look forward to further supporting Moldova’s progress on the EU accession path.",

EU leaders welcomed the resilience of the euro area economy despite multiple shocks, as well as price stability. The robustness of the labour market, reflected by record low unemployment, was also welcomed. EU leaders affirmed their unity and commitment to enhancing economic resilience and competitiveness. They invited continued close monitoring by the Eurogroup of economic and fiscal developments in the present geopolitical environment.",
                "The Euro Summit also reinforced the political commitment to strengthening the international role of the euro, including its role as a reserve currency and transaction currency, by deepening integration in capital markets and completing the banking union. The Euro Summit also welcomed recent progress on the digital euro and stressed the importance of swiftly finishing legislative work and advancing other preparatory steps. EU leaders look forward to welcoming Bulgaria as the 21st member of the euro from the beginning of 2026. I thank and congratulate the Government of Bulgaria on this important milestone, because it takes a lot to achieve euro membership.",

As we ramp up our preparations for the Presidency, I look forward to our continued discussions on the work of the EU as we work to address the most pressing issues of the time. The Presidency is going to be very interesting. We are going to have a meeting of the European Political Community, which will be the largest meeting of its kind ever to be held in Ireland. There will also be a leaders' summit, 22 ministerial meetings and 250 other meetings in Ireland, as well as many meetings in Brussels and Luxembourg.",
                "Ireland will also take charge, or, at least, take responsibility for gathering and presenting the EU's position at international events, such as the COP. There will be four COP summits next year. There might be an International Maritime Organization agreement, a World Health Organization agreement and many others. Ireland will actually be taking the lead in those contexts. A huge amount of work is going to happen, much of which will not be seen by the public. It is a huge opportunity to enhance our reputation as a country and to do a good job from the level of the Taoiseach and Ministers to civil servants and all of us. I should remind colleagues as well that a portal is open now at gov.ie for a public consultation on what Ireland’s priorities should be during our Presidency. I welcome every response we get to that consultation. It is very important we hear from as wide a range of people as possible."

I am conscious that it was the subject of debate among the leaders last week, which I totally understand, but it is important that the House has clarity on it. The Protected Disclosures Act was agreed by this House without a vote. Everybody supports the idea of it and the purpose of it is to protect whistleblowers. It creates an obligation on the Minister to establish a channel on their website and an email process for whistleblowers to be able to make disclosures. That exists in the Department of Health. On the website, it is very clear that this is a channel to reach the protected disclosures commissioner. It is a separate, dedicated, secure mailbox, one that I do not see or have access to, nor do my private secretaries. The purpose of maintaining that separation is exclusively for the protection of whistleblowers. I know it was mentioned that this represented a lack of curiosity on my part but I would say to the House that if I or any other Minister were to start checking what is coming into the protected disclosures mailbox, it would create a completely new and different problem for whistleblowers. It would undermine the idea of there being a protected channel specifically for that. I know the House is already aware of that because of its support for the Act but I wish to put beyond doubt the need to protect whistleblowers and the reason for those steps. It is not, in fact, something that comes to a Minister's desk, nor should it come to a Minister's desk. It should be investigated separately and appropriately. If we had a Minister like me or anybody else who was interfering in a curious sort of way in what was in the mailbox, that would raise important confidence issues in that Minister. It is important to be clear in relation to that and I thank the House for indulging me in that way.",
                "Much more importantly, on the question of paediatric spinal surgery waiting lists, which is the subject of our discussion today, I wish to thank all the Members of the House who have engaged with me on this in the past number of months since I became Minister for Health.",
                "I have tried to place a significant and systemic focus on productivity, generally in our hospitals, but in this most acute area of need of pediatric spinal services. All of us do this because we are concerned about the children on whom this impacts. We are concerned about their quality of life, the nature of the supports and interventions they get and the necessity for those to be timely. In particular, I thank all of the patients, families and advocacy groups I have spoken to at different times throughout this year because, while we speak about numbers, initiatives and reforms what we are speaking about, of course, are children - patients - many of whom have quite complex medical conditions, a multiplicity of medical conditions, and who need very great care. I want to assure patients and families I have heard what they have said to me and that their perspective is vital in ensuring the reforms we know must be ongoing to ensure better, timely care.",
                "I also say to Members of this House that I, like them, am the recipient of people coming to me with complex cases; cases where there is a sense that intervention is necessary now, that intervention has been too late and that there is a difficulty with communication. In my case, as Minister, I can take those cases up with the National Patient Safety Office and have them advanced and I know that has been the case with some of the people who have come to me and brought cases to me. I wish to say to Deputies that there is an open invitation to my door to anybody who wants or needs to bring a case to my attention. Deputies will appreciate we do all of this scheduling in a particular way and it is not perfect. Tomorrow I will be meeting CHI on two issues. One is the children's hospital and the second is yet another meeting in relation to what is happening on spinal services and what has happened since our last meeting. One of the things I will want to look at most closely is the specific care plan for all of those children who are at the level of most complexity in the system. There are certain GDPR constraints to the information that can be shared with me but I have several cases on my desk, as I know other Deputies have. There is a real openness here to get to an understanding that the most complex children can get the care and intervention they need in a timely and appropriate way. I want to say that as a general opening statement and invitation to all.",
                "As we know, scoliosis affects about 1% of children and adolescents in Ireland. Many of those children do not, in fact, require surgery but for those who do, timely access to intervention and treatment is critical. For those children who need surgical intervention, we agree the waiting times are too long. I am acutely aware of the burden that long wait places on those young patients and it can make their situation very much more difficult.",
                "Improving access to spinal surgery has been the focus of sustained and determined efforts over several years by several Ministers for Health and we have not fully reached our goals. I want to acknowledge that the efforts that have been put in so far have yielded tangible progress and I also acknowledge the dedication of the nursing team, the healthcare professionals, the multidisciplinary teams and, indeed, the surgeons who are delivering better outcomes than we have had before. In this House, we are dealing with patients on a day-to-day basis and we know we need to go further and do better.",
                "There has been a significant focus on investment for those services. There has been new infrastructure. We have a fifth theatre in Temple Street, an additional MRI scanner in Crumlin, and 24 additional new beds. In 2024, my predecessor ensured 52 new full-time equivalent posts were approved to strengthen services, including surgeons, nursing staff, administrative staff, and all of the different pieces of that, including four orthopaedic surgeons, one of whom has been in post since August of this year. Of course, we would like to recruit all four but we have only been able to recruit one to date. Some 41 of the 52 staff are in post and we are actively trying to recruit the rest, especially at consultant level.",
                "It is important to say we have tried to increase capacity in a range of different ways, both domestically within CHI and internationally. Let me address some of the complexities of the issues I have seen as Minister. For example, in 2024 we agreed with the Mater hospital that it would conduct an enhanced transitional service, adding to the transitional services already in place, and indeed it was funded to do so. An additional 29.5 posts were approved for the Mater hospital to enhance the adolescent transitional spinal service and try to improve the seamlessness with which transitional care would occur. It was only at the beginning of the second half of 2025 that this service began to operate, which I think is deeply regrettable. I know from my engagement with patients and parents that the service is, in fact, operating, and that there have been, I think, four outpatient clinics to date in the Mater during the second half of 2025, and three surgeries have been scheduled. I believe it is problematic and regrettable that that intervention and step taken by my predecessor in 2024, for which posts were allocated and funded, in fact only began in 2025. It is now the case that those posts are all in recruitment because the service has begun and there has been a commitment by the Mater for that to begin, and those posts should all be fully in place during the first quarter of 2026.",
                "On international outsourcing, again my predecessor approved over €16 million for international outsourcing initiatives since 2024. That was designed to support earlier surgery for children with very complex cases to get the care they needed abroad as clinically appropriate. However, it is a source of great frustration to me that a total of only 19 children have been the beneficiary of that. It is a source of frustration to me that the number is not higher and it is a source of frustration to families who would like to travel and who either have not been offered the opportunity to do so or who believe they would have been suitable. I acknowledge that not every child is suitable for travel. There may be some for whom it is not suitable or who cannot travel. There is a tension here where I believe more should be done but there is a clinical element to those decisions and it is not appropriate for me, as Minister, to interfere with that on an individual clinical basis. Yet, when I look at the system, what I see is 1,000 surgeries, essentially - 500 last year and slightly more than 500 this year - available for children who have needed surgery and in the period of 2024 to 2025 where the international outsourcing option was available only 19 of those 1,000 surgeries have been done internationally. From a systemic perspective, that does not ring true to me. That has been the case to date but we are trying to expand our international options to drive even further the opportunities to travel, both in Europe, and for additional surgeries in the United States. At the moment we have the New York-Presbyterian Hospital and we have Great Ormond Street Hospital but CHI has gone through a tender process during the past number of months, at the direction of the Department of Health and at my direction, to try to expand opportunities internationally. That is bring finalised shortly and I believe it will involve multiple additional hospitals.",
                "The point I am making to the House is that if the experience to date has been that there has been an international option but it was not available to patients at the rate that might be suggested with 19 out of 1,000, then it is essential that if we are providing additional international options, that there is a very clear understanding those options can and should be used. That is extremely important.",
                "From an operational level within CHI, the pediatric spinal surgery management unit was established last year. It is a dedicated unit to try to co-ordinate surgeries better across Temple Street, Crumlin and Cappagh hospitals. It is working more closely with multidisciplinary teams to do that. Efforts to expand capacity within CHI progress and, indeed, will be the subject of my dialogue with it tomorrow, including ring-fenced theatres and dedicated orthopaedic beds. To be fair, that implementation has in fact reduced the waiting times for spinal surgeries in general. Additional outpatient clinics have also begun to assess new patients more promptly and that is both necessary and helpful. Since April 2024, over 800 new patients have been seen in those clinics and that has reduced the time to be seen by a consultant in addition to the dedicated referral pathways.",
                "Domestic outsourcing arrangements have also been expanded, using pathways to Blackrock and Cappagh more quickly for non-complex spinal procedures. Over 74 children have used those pathways since the beginning of this year. As I said, we have tried to expand the international option.",
                "In regard to these initiatives and investment, while I have expressed a measure of frustration with the pace and wanting to do more, I need to acknowledge all of the dedicated team - the nurses, anaesthetists, surgeons and so on - who are doing the work and that there are surgeries happening . We know children are getting surgeries and it is at an increasing rate. In 2024, CHI performed 513 spinal procedures, which was a 10% increase on 2023 and 35% increase on 2019. Already in 2025, 446 procedures have been completed, which is an 8% increase on last year. There is growth and there is more activity. Also, this year there has been an 8% increase in referrals and at this time we are 7% behind target. So, the picture is yet to improve but there are also an increase in referrals.",
                "What matters most, of course, is the length of time that children are waiting on the procedure. There has been an improvement in the longest wait lists. At the end of October 68% of patients on the active list were waiting less than six months, which is an improvement on last year, which was 56%. Further, at the end of October, only 6% of patients were waiting 12 months, which again is an improvement on 16% at this time last year. Again, at the end of October, 38% of patients were waiting within the Sláintecare targets, although I would like that to be substantially increased. I will acknowledge all of the difficulties, the challenges and frustrations that I have but I will also acknowledge the progress that has been made and which we want to see continuing to improve. I am also seeing improvements in the outpatient wait list. The children without an appointment to date on the new outpatient waiting list has reduced by 48% since the start of the year. I am informed by CHI that currently there is no child waiting over nine months without an appointment for a new outpatient appointment. That improvement is ensuring children are seen more quickly.",
                "While we absolutely must acknowledge progress, we also cannot mask the ongoing reality that too many children are still waiting and that too many children with complex cases are still waiting. Up to the end of October this year there have been an additional 462 children, or 8%, who have been added to the active surgical waiting list. It does reflect a growing need and it reflects a better referral pathway, but it is still children who need spinal surgeries. There is also a shift in the complexity of cases presenting at CHI because non-complex cases are now being referred to other hospitals to be done more quickly. That in itself is a good thing. I am, however, concerned about the children with complex cases who may need several procedures and who may need very significant multidisciplinary support.",
                "I am also concerned about the communication. This is something that families have repeatedly expressed to Deputies across this House as being very challenging for them. I have made it clear that the nature, the style and the promptness of communications has to change. The way in which families are discussing surgeries, surgical interventions and the overall plan for their child is everybody's responsibility, and it is not to be approached in a siloed way. It is difficult for us to build a new theatre and to recruit a new surgeon, to be fair, but it is not difficult to pick up the phone to talk to somebody properly and in a comprehensive and timely way about the needs of their child. These are things that can be done and I have said this in the House before. To support improvement, we have appointed a spinal patient advocate liaison co-ordinator. There is a patient panel for spinal services to try to improve communication. There are 14 members on that panel at the moment. A key worker, or patient advocate function, is also being rolled out. I am saying to Deputies that there have been efforts made to try to improve communication. While I understand from parents that the benefit of this is not yet universal, steps are being taken and we have more work to do on it, which, essentially, is what I am trying to say in a truncated way to make the all of the points that I hope to make.",
                "I will address some of the different reviews and issues that are occurring more broadly in CHI historically. Of course what we want is to have a future-looking system where everybody has confidence in the system. The difficulty with the issues of the past is that they must be addressed, there must be transparency, and it is very important to acknowledge that, while we try to look to the future and try to improve services, we also have to hear and understand the experience of the past and difficult experience of the current day. In April I stood in this House and we discussed the HIQA review of the governance of implantable medical devices in CHI, including the use of non-CE springs in Temple Street hospital. A month later we were here to discuss the Thomas independent external medical audit for Children's Health Ireland and pelvic osteotomy. At an early stage in April, I had a very clear concern about the culture in orthopaedic services, as I know Deputies across the House had, including the way in which waiting lists have been managed to date and how that has operated. A month later we had the 2022 report, the unpublished report, and the Nayagam review is also under way, phase 2 of which is reviewing the service, including the governance. There is a series of different reports and I am conscious that, behind every one of those reports, there is a patient and there is a child.",
                "In response to the multiplicity of reports and in response to the concern I have about the culture and the waiting list management, I commissioned an audit the details of which we have not yet received. It is very important that we debate this when we do receive it. That audit has two elements. I commissioned this via the CEO of the HSE. It consists of an audit of governance and of equity in patient access and waiting list management, and that commenced in June. The audit is being undertaken by the HSE internal auditor. It is independent. I am told it is nearing completion and I expect the outcome shortly. It is really important to note that, at the time, I also asked for there to be a qualitative patient experience element to this. I asked Lily Collison, who is an advocate for spinal services, cerebral palsy and epilepsy, and who is, among many other things, a member of the HSE board, to complete that. Ms Collison has been in CHI this past number of months doing a survey of parents, speaking to parents who wish to speak to her, and trying to better understand the patient experience by asking how they ended up on a waiting list, what was their experience and what has happened to date. I expect her report shortly. I did not publicise her name at an early stage because I wanted to give her the opportunity to get on with her work in a quiet and effective way and to give her the privacy to do that. It is very important to say that we did both of those things at that time. I expect to have that report very shortly.",
                "I will not address the spinal task force, which continues its work, as it is a question of time, but I do want to talk about the inquiry the Cabinet agreed to yesterday. It is our intention to have a statutory public inquiry into the care generally received by children with scoliosis, complex scoliosis, spina bifida and hydrocephalus, and the care issues around that. It is really important now that I become extremely careful with what I say about the detail of that. I am conscious that we want to establish a process that is legally robust and that has very clear terms of reference. We have asked the parents, the advocacy groups and the breadth of stakeholders, including the advocacy groups that are on the spinal task force, to engage with a facilitator who will help and listen to understand the best scope and help develop a proposal to me so I can properly draft terms of reference and have those agreed by the Government . It is the intention to do that with families in the most appropriate way, recognising that it is, of course, the Government and the Oireachtas that will have to ultimately sign off on them. The Attorney General is already engaging with potential people and potential names, including senior counsel and so on, to determine who may have availability to do this work and to get that going as quickly as possible. Of course, the calibre, the quality and the experience of the people we want to do this work is not always immediately available tomorrow. They have schedules and commitments already, so we are trying to do our best to get somebody as quickly as possible but also who is as capable as possible for doing that.",
                "I am very conscious that my colleague is going to speak and I do not wish to speak across her. Perhaps I can address any questions that Deputies have in my concluding remarks. I am conscious there will be a lot of interest in that.",
                "We are continuing with the journey in relation to the integration of CHI into HSE. I am not sure I have had the opportunity to formally update the House in relation to the board members who have been appointed or the chair being confirmed by Cabinet last week. That work is ongoing. We will need to now prioritise the legislative element of that and bring it to the House, I hope in 2026, to begin the process of making that transfer more formal. I wish to give my colleague the opportunity to speak now."

                "It is right to say that we are not where we need to be, as the Minister has said. We need to address the urgent problems in spinal care, despite sincere efforts of successive Ministers, and that is true. I acknowledge again the Minister's work on this in the recent months in driving measures to address the urgent problem. She has met with the family of Harvey and she is working to improve access to services. This is under way, including a ring-fenced theatre, extra outpatient clinics, and national and international outsourcing to maximise capacity. Every effort is being made to reduce waiting times but we know that there are still challenges and reform is needed.",
                "I welcome the Government's approval yesterday of the Minister's proposal for a statutory public inquiry. I fully support this inquiry. I have met with affected families from my own area and I know that they are keen for this inquiry to take place as soon as possible. It is a very important step to ensure that we have the best healthcare system possible for our children.",
                "Every child's journey to spinal surgery is different. Some steps may take longer, especially when the case is complex and several specialists are involved. Every precaution must always be taken to make surgery as safe as possible, to ensure that the children who need complex care are fully prepared, and that their care plan is the right care plan for them.",
                "I understand this can take time. Strengthening governance and oversight, driving down waiting times, and ensuring increased engagement and timely communications with families must be priorities. As the Minister said, working with families and making them a priority is very important. I know she is also committed to this. We must work to ensure there is a cultural change so that families can have trust in the system. I know the CEO of the HSE has established the CHI improvement steering group and has commissioned an audit to assess equal access to care in CHI, and this is a welcome step.",
                "We must continue to listen to and work with the parents and advocacy groups who are highlighting hugely worrying and important issues. Like the Minister, I have been there, speaking to families and working with them. I assure her I will be working with her to give any help and support I can. I know the Government is committed to this. As the Minister has said, our aim is that children receive the care they need when they need it.

                "In 2017, the Tánaiste, Simon Harris, made a promise to children with scoliosis and spina bifida that long waiting lists would essentially end and that children would no longer wait in pain, deteriorate or lose the chance of life-changing and, in some cases, life-saving intervention. He promised that no child would be left waiting longer than four months for surgery. Since then, as we know, countless children have suffered in agony, without surgery within four months and, in many cases, tragically, without surgery at all.",
                "We have to go back to the very beginning. Children's Health Ireland was legally established by Simon Harris in 2018. Yet, from its first days, it has lurched from crisis to crisis and the children who depend on the services have paid the price. CHI, as we know, was formed to amalgamate, essentially, the children's hospitals in Dublin, with a promise to provide a world-class service for children. Despite the Trojan work of healthcare workers in Crumlin, Temple Street and Cappagh, and I know that many people who work in these hospitals provide a tremendous service, the promise of providing a world-class service for all children never materialised. At the heart of this is exceptionally poor governance, which is made worse by four years of delays to the new children's hospital, a hospital that has made a mockery of the State because of a fundamentally flawed contract. It has to be said that this another calamity with Simon Harris's fingerprints all over it because he was, after all, the Minister who greenlit that project and signed off on the contract.",
                "We know that children with spina bifida and scoliosis have waited far too long for essential surgeries. Even today, there are 232 children on waiting lists for spinal surgery, with most of them having waited longer than three months. We do not know how many have waited for longer than four months because CHI does not publish this information. Even when it comes to waiting lists and how they are presented, there is an appalling lack of transparency. What we do know is that behind every number is a child sometimes in pain, losing mobility and getting worse. The waiting list figures are concerning. The number of children without a date for surgery is up to 139, and another 43 are waiting on a date for a further procedure. Only nine actually have a date; the rest are suspended for various reasons. One child has now been waiting over 48 months for surgery, more than four years on the waiting list. Seven more have been waiting over a year. Children cannot wait months or years for time-sensitive and, at times, life-saving and life-changing spinal surgery. We know that many have not received proper pre-operative or post-operative care. We also know that many children are staying in hospital longer than expected because of high infection rates. This means many children stay in for weeks instead of days, causing distress, pain, time lost in school and time lost with family, and knock-on delays for other children waiting for care. Families tell me they are not being given the real data on infection rates, so they cannot give proper, informed consent. They are told to trust an organisation that has repeatedly abused and broken that trust, according to these very same parents.",
                "One of the saddest failures in CHI is the abandonment of a group of children who came to be known as the Crumlin orphans. These are a group of children left without the care of any consultant in orthopaedics or urology. When this group of children was identified by what was known as the Dixon report, CHI said nothing. In fact, it never published the report and, worse than this, it never accepted the findings, despite the fact that we all know the findings were conclusive and were correct. CHI could not even say how many children were in this group. When this issue was identified again a few years later in another unpublished report, CHI still did not know how many children were in this group. This is a group of children who simply fell through the cracks. It is not that nobody knew this. The parents knew. They were screaming from the rooftops, but nobody in CHI management or in Government Buildings was listening.",
                "Since then, we had the case of unauthorised non-medical-grade springs being implanted in children's backs. The HIQA review of these cases found severe governance failures, which allowed these tragedies to occur in the first place. HIQA found a lack of formal approval processes, inadequate oversight, poor record-keeping or a lack of consent from parents - the Minister mentioned this and poor communication earlier - poor tracking and traceability of devices and hygiene standards, and exceptionally weak clinical governance structures. These were not one-off lapses. They were the product of a system where governance was weak, where oversight was absent and, as the HIQA report said, where children were not protected from the risk of harm.",
                "This scandal goes beyond spinal surgery waiting lists. We also know there have been potentially hundreds of unnecessary hip surgeries carried out on children. We have unpublished reports raising even more serious concerns about how CHI is governed and how children's services are delivered. We are still waiting on the Nayagam review, which may be next year. We were promised interim reports but they never materialised. We still have questions over new funding for children's orthopaedics. The Minister mentioned funding that is available. There are question marks around whether this is sufficient, whether it is targeted and whether it will deliver the capacity that children urgently need.",
                "If anybody wants to understand the cost of these failures, they need look no further than the case of Harvey Morrison Sherratt. Harvey Morrison Sherratt was just one year old when the Tánaiste made his four-months-to-surgery promise. It took another seven years for Harvey to get that surgery. During the delays, Harvey's spinal curve deteriorated from severe to catastrophic. By 2022, his spinal curvature was 65° and by 2024, it had reached 110° and then 130°. Harvey was placed on an urgent waiting list for scoliosis surgery but he was also taken off that urgent waiting list and his parents still do not know why. Why was he taken off? Who took him off? I know the inquiry will obviously have to answer these questions. What we do know is that it happened without the consent of his parents, and his parents were not even informed. It is breathtaking to think that would happen.",
                "It has since come to light that Harvey was allegedly and wrongfully removed from the list because he was listed as a palliative care patient, despite the fact that a consultant at Great Ormond Street Hospital had assessed him and found him as suitable for surgery. This compounds the anger the family justifiably have. While there was still potential to save young Harvey's life, it seems that someone took him off the list, and worse, it seems that someone decided not to communicate this to his parents. It was only late last year when Harvey eventually received his first surgery. Harvey's condition was entirely treatable, as far as I am concerned. His parents, Stephen and Gillian, campaigned with extraordinary courage to get the care of their son needed but, after years of delay and avoidable decline, Harvey tragically passed away this year, at the tender age of nine. Harvey was entirely failed every step of the way. CHI failed to give him the care he needed when he needed it. His case is now a defining symbol of systemic failure.",
                "When I think of Harvey, I also think of the countless children and young adults who have been failed by CHI. I think of Dollceanna, who died at the age of ten after complications during surgery on her spine at Temple Street. I think of young TJ, who was diagnosed with spina bifida and scoliosis. He was denied early intervention and has now been told his condition is inoperable because he spent his childhood on waiting lists.",
                "I think of Mikey from Mayo, who is still waiting for care. In fact, I think his parents have reached out looking for a meeting. These are just three children and there are many more names that we do not know. However, we know these children's names because their parents were forced to campaign, go public and have their cases raised here in this Chamber. It is only because of the courageous work of advocates that we know any of this. If CHI had its way, none of this would have come to light.",
                "The tragedy here is that if the Government had listened to parents and advocates sooner, we might not have been here today discussing this issue at all. If it had delivered the resources and funding sooner, many of these tragedies would have been prevented. I pay tribute to Stephen and Gillian, Harvey's parents, as I have done in the past, but also to Amanda, Una, Claire and all of those advocates and mothers and fathers who went above and beyond the call of duty. They became advocates for others, not just their own children. I also pay tribute to the whistleblowers who came forward. We owe them a debt of gratitude as well.",
                "What is needed now is not another internal review, another limited report or another chapter in a long pattern of deflection and delay. We need a full, independent, statutory public inquiry that is fit for purpose and can establish the facts, trace decisions and failures and finally deliver real accountability. Crucially, this inquiry has to have the full backing of families and advocates. It must be developed with them and it must get answers to the questions they have. It is important that we also improve the services. While an inquiry will be established, it is equally important that we invest in services. We have to make sure that every single child has timely access to care. I know from dealing with and talking to many parents that it is not just the surgeries. It is the pre-operative and post-operative care and the totality of that child's care that are really important.",

I really hope that it is fit for purpose. I hope we see full co-operation from everybody involved and that all of those children and families get justice. I hope we can learn from this but also crucially invest in the services that need it."

                "I very much welcome our having these statements today, and the big breakthrough that has happened over the past week in terms of the agreement to the inquiry. Obviously, we have to see what the exact form of that inquiry will be. We have seen scandal after scandal in spinal services within CHI over many years. It is very welcome that there will now be a proper investigation of that. I know we have had statements before and have paid tribute to the parents of Harvey Morrison Sherratt but in particular, I pay tribute to their immense dignity and incredible strength in dealing with the revelations they have had to encounter over the last fortnight and in the face of their absolutely devastating loss. How badly failed they were by the health system that should have been there for their son has played out so publicly. I am also hugely mindful today that when we talk about spinal services, for some children and young adults it is now too late because of the failures within the system. They carry those questions for the rest of their lives about what could have been if their treatment and care had been different and if those failures had not been present. To those families who are currently fighting for surgery, of whom there are many, there is a bitter irony that the families of these children, some of the sickest children in this State, are having to put up the greatest of fights for appropriate care. That is wrong.",
                "While we talk about the patient, the child and the family at the heart of this, we know there are many nurses and doctors who are going day in, day out into a very difficult work environment and trying to do the best by their patient. Unfortunately, however, there is a system and there are some decision-makers and clinicians who have failed in their duty. That is what needs to dramatically change. I do not think it is an understatement to say what has happened has been a national scandal. When we look back in ten or 20 years, we will wonder how children have been so badly failed. These are children who have been in the health service for a long time. Their conditions have been recognised for a long time, yet the systems of care have failed so badly.",
                "In that context, I welcome the Government's announcement that it will have an inquiry, but I have to ask what it will lead to. To my mind, it is not just about what has happened but what is currently happening within CHI. If we think back - other Deputies have referred to this - over the past eight years, we have had at least five reports into the failures within CHI. There was the Dixon report, which now seems to have been disowned by CHI because it was then obviously known as Temple Street. There was the Boston report in 2023. There was the HIQA report, which was commissioned in 2023 and published earlier this year. The Minister referred to the Simon Thomas report and, of course, we are awaiting the Nayagam report. Between the Boston report and the HIQA report, there are 59 recommendations as to how to overhaul services within CHI. Those are recommendations that all arise from the same dysfunction and the lack of proper processes, toxic culture, appalling management and lack of collegiate responsibility.",
                "The reports themselves should be sufficient to bring about necessary change, but the Government's agreement to an inquiry is an admission that they are not. The devastating allegation that Harvey Morrison Sherratt was moved to a palliative care list is a really distressing new low for CHI. If it is true, how could anybody in good conscious make that change and not follow up as to how that child was doing? Time and again, there is this bitter irony that we are not talking about thousands of children. We are talking about a small number of children who have been so badly failed. One parent whose child has now passed away said to me that her child became a political football between the egos of consultants. While, as I said, there are some really good spinal surgeons out there working in our system, we have to ask how we have got to this place.",
                "With regard to what is happening now, we know the list is longer this year than it was last year, as the Minister alluded to, and there are 139 on the list now. There is an element of us not even running to stand still. We understand that no child has been scheduled for treatment abroad over the past number of months, and we have heard the Minister's frustration on this. A big deal was made about referring children to Great Ormond Street Hospital or Morgan Stanley hospital. One family have told me their child has been on the waiting list for 12 months. The child has been told they need surgery. The family believe the child can travel. They have not been offered the option to travel and when they spoke to their surgeon, they were told that surgeon does not have a list in the Blackrock Clinic and, therefore, could not refer that child to the outsourced option, whereas that option appears to be available to other children. How can we have a dysfunctional system where one surgeon decides who gets outsourced, whereas another surgeon cannot? This is the dysfunction at the heart of CHI.",
                "With regard to this inquiry, so much is riding on what it will produce where it seems a number of reports have failed. Obviously, it is really important that it will have compellability because, ultimately, any inquiry is only as good as the fulsome participation of the clinicians and management. There are serious questions as to whether they will participate willingly or not. I, and we in the Labour Party, believe that compellability will be important. It is vital that the advocacy groups be there all along the way. I pay particular tribute to the tenacity and perseverance of the Scoliosis Advocacy Network and the Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus Paediatric Advocacy Group. Many of those parents already have so much on their hands trying to care for their child. They are fighting for their family but they are doing much more than that. They are fighting for other families who do not have that capacity. It is absolutely exhausting and they have been at it for so many years.",
                "With regard to getting truth, accountability and justice out of this inquiry, the critical thing for us is that we believe a twin-track process needs to be in place.",
                "There will have to be a series of stage reports. First, we need a module on whether CHI is implementing the change that it has promised to deliver. In effect, we need a mediated process whereby the record is set straight between clinicians and parents as to the status of the child's care. All too often parents come to me and to other Deputies here who feel gaslit, who feel they are not being told the truth and who feel they are being told conflicting stories by the clinicians and the health staff that they interact with. I hear what the Minister said regarding the process that is up and running with regard to that lady who is already interacting with those families but it needs to be a mediated process between the clinicians and the families because ultimately many of the families feel they are not getting the truth they so rightly deserve.",
                "The second key issue is the investigation into the cases of children who passed away because of the failings in care and those children for whom surgical intervention was too late. There will inevitably be allegations that will lead to litigation and so on. It will potentially go on for a very long time. We believe the onus is on the Minister to ensure that this inquiry will deliver the answers that we, the public and particularly the parents, so much need. Our request to the Minister is that this inquiry can get those answers, which may turn adversarial, while also ensuring that the system improves. There are very real question marks about how that can happen with a very limited number of staff at the heart of these questions over the coming years. That will be no easy task. We in the Labour Party have said for many months now that the HSE needs to take over the board of CHI. We very much welcome the Minister's move in that regard. We urge her to move with speed on that issue. It is no silver bullet but it will be progress. Ultimately, the biggest question in my mind now is getting this inquiry right, getting the answers and making sure that systems improve at the same time. The people needing to provide the answers will also have to improve their act with regard to the services."

We are here today because of the heroic efforts of the parents of children with scoliosis and spina bifida, because of their determination and because their love of their children. We are also here because they never stopped fighting tooth and nail. In particular, we are here because of the parents of Harvey Morrison Sherratt, Stephen Morrison and Gillian Sherratt. They found the will, even when grieving the loss of their son, to take on the Government. I cannot imagine the suffering they have been through or even fathom as a parent myself how to find the strength to keep fighting. They want to know how their son and many others could have been failed so badly by the State and why children continue to be failed in the most horrifying ways. The removal of Harvey from surgical waiting lists to be treated as a palliative care patient without any discussion with his family is the most recent, shocking piece of information to come to light. What else remains hidden? What other cover-up is there in the hope it never sees the light of day? Let us be clear: a public inquiry is no one's first choice. People want public services to work for the State to function properly. When things go wrong, people want a system that can respond. Instead we have a system that is threatened by transparency and allergic to accountability and that looks to protect itself at all costs. When all else fails, people expect the Government they elect to be on their side, not to turn a blind eye to their suffering; a Government that takes responsibility, not leaders that default to spin and deflection when people are crying out for help.",
                "Eight years ago, Deputy Simon Harris, when Minister for Health, promised that no child would be waiting longer than four months for scoliosis surgery. That promise has never been delivered. It is a shameful chapter in this State and it is not over. How could this ever have happened? How could failure get stacked on failure without any accountability or action? The HSE was set up in 2005. It was billed as some type of innovation at the time. However, it created a buffer between the Department of Health and the Government on the one hand and the health service and the people within it on the other. At the time, Dr. Liam Twomey, a TD representing Fine Gael said: \"One can only imagine the scapegoating that will be due to the CEO of the HSE when the Government fails.\" Last year, the then Taoiseach of this State, Deputy Simon Harris, fulfilled that bleak prediction. When it was put to him that he and his Government had actively, consistently and comprehensively failed children with scoliosis and spina bifida, that children's spines twisted and curved, leaving them in agony as little rib cages pressed against lungs making it more and more difficult to breathe, and that children were left waiting so long that they became inoperable, he said, \"It was said to me by the then director general of the HSE that the executive would have put a plan in place to ensure that no child waited longer than four months.\" The Taoiseach of the day, a former health Minister, said he was only the messenger. Someone told him that they would make a plan and it was nothing to do with him. That is why we are here today. That is why we need a public inquiry. It is because of gross political failure, a failure of leadership. Children and families have been left with no option. A public inquiry is their only hope. It has to deliver the answers. It has to deliver accountability and real change. That is why the process needs to be fully independent of CHI and the HSE.",

                "It important to speak on this issue on behalf of children and families who have been let down. I am devastated for them. Deputies across the House are angry and upset because what unfolded in our paediatric spinal service is not just some abstract policy failure. It is a human tragedy. It is a breach of trust. It is so profound that any parent would question how they would ever rely a system that left their own child waiting in pain again. I am glad the State is confronting this horrendous situation fully and, in particular confronting how we allowed children to suffer under our watch. I appreciate and respect the work the Minister is doing. She is clear and unapologetic in her statements. The country now knows of the heartbreaking story of Harvey Morrison Sherratt, a nine-year-old boy removed from an urgent spinal surgery waiting list without his parents' knowledge or consent. Parents were begging for answers that never came. Now those same parents live with their unthinkable grief. No parent in Ireland should ever fear that their child has simply vanished off a waiting list. No parent should be forced to battle a system that feels faceless, careless or evasive. No child should ever be left to suffer because of a broken system that could not protect them. That is exactly what happened.",
                "In my previous contributions in this House, which I firmly stand over, I said that when the State asks families to trust us with their children, we must be worthy of that trust. In the case of Harvey and so many others, we were not. Now families across the paediatric spinal services understandably ask whether this will ever change. I know the Minister is committed to that change, to rebuilding that trust, to ensuring that our children receive the care they deserve. Progress has been made, additional clinics and a ring-fenced theatre, increased activity with 446 spinal procedures this year, reduced lists of long waiters. More children are being seen sooner. These reforms matter. I acknowledge the extraordinary staff who are pushing beyond all reasonable limits every day.",
                "However, numbers will never balance the scales where there is the loss or ill treatment of a child. They cannot ease the fear, stress or the anguish families feel, watching their children deteriorate while surgery seems endlessly out of reach. Multiple reviews are under way, which the Minister highlighted them in her contribution. They will be important but reviews alone will not heal the trauma. Families need the truth, they need justice and they need a system that will not hide from the convenient ambiguity of fractured governance. That is why I am delighted at the Government's decision to move ahead with the full statutory inquiry, beginning with the facilitator to scope its terms of reference. It is not just welcome; it is essential. It must be thorough. It must place the voices of children and parents at the centre. We owe parents nothing less and we owe every family living in fear nothing less than reform. Reform cannot pause while the inquiry proceeds. Failures in communications must be fixed. The Minister noted these in her contribution as well. Clinical governance has to be tightened, not on paper but in practice.",
                "No child must ever again be removed from a list without explanation and capacity must continue to expand so children are treated before harm becomes permanent.",
                "I acknowledge the significant structural reform under way. In September, the Minister confirmed her intention to integrate Children's Health Ireland into the HSE. The decision follows careful reflection on the governance structures underpinning our health system, engagement with stakeholders and discussions with Government colleagues. It is really important. During previous contributions, Members spoke about how our faith in CHI had diminished.",
                "Finally, I wish the Minister the very best as she takes on this work. This crisis was not of her making but it is absolutely in her hands now. I am confident she will bring this to a conclusion. I know she is committed to ensuring that families and children finally get the timely and proper care, as well as the answers, justice and decency that they deserve.

They also do not know what it will look like, when it will happen or where it will take place. A statutory inquiry is important, but timelines and some parameters would also be helpful at this point.",

However, that there are two sides to this. Unapproved medical springs were used and that has been well-documented. There has been an in-depth investigation into that issue and the Minister and her Department were very much involved in that.",
                "While I am not going to name people here today, there is a body of parents, whom I and many other Members from both sides of the House have met, who feel aggrieved that one of the key surgeons that their children was on the list to see is no longer performing surgery in Ireland for many reasons. This issue has to work its way through due process and all of that. One issue mentioned to me was that at an Oireachtas health committee meeting that took place on 8 July 2022 someone shone a spotlight on a €90 million scoliosis fund, which was misused. These parents believe that this issue has been used as a stick to beat a certain surgeon. It is important to say that on the record.",
                "In the Minister's summing-up at the end of this debate, I ask that she gives the House any additional detail she is able to regarding the statutory public inquiry. It would be very much appreciated. She has been in this job for nine or ten months and, like my colleague who spoke previously, I have full faith in her to fulfil her duties. This problem was not of her making but she will be the Minister who oversees the establishment of the statutory inquiry and please God the outcome of it.",
                "It is very important that Harvey's family are not locked out of the process. When inquiries are set up, parameters become very rigid. This needs to be delicately handled and Harvey's family needs to be front and centre in everything that happens over the coming months. Ultimately, there also needs to be a strategy that is effective, that does not involve arduous waits and that ensures children who have scoliosis have a pathway to treatment."

That report made recommendations for service improvements that were never implemented.",
                "In 2017, the Ombudsman for Children's report found serious and ongoing violations of the rights of children waiting for scoliosis treatment. In response, the then Minister for Health, Simon Harris, promised no child with scoliosis would wait longer than four months for surgery. In 2023, the ombudsman published a report into CHI's care of Ivy, a child with scoliosis. It found numerous failings of governance and communication within CHI. Ivy had been waiting for spinal surgery for five years, during which time the curve of her spine went from 30° to 135°. The same year saw the Boston review, which found infection rates at CHI were way above international norms. In 2024, a follow-up report into Ivy's case was published and revealed that surgery had been delayed so long that Ivy was no longer operable. In 2025, an independent audit revealed nearly 80% of hip surgeries on children at Cappagh and nearly 60% on those in Temple Street were not clinically indicated, meaning potentially hundreds of children underwent unnecessary surgeries. In the same year, HIQA published a report into the use of unauthorised springs in spinal surgeries on children with scoliosis. It found there was no evidence of ethical approval and identified issues with culture, governance and internal communications. A report compiled in 2021, which CHI refused to publish in full, was leaked and uncovered bullying and a workplace culture with the potential to put patients at risk.",
                "We also know there are outstanding reports. There is the Nagayam review into spinal surgery at CHI commissioned in 2023. The 2017 Dickson review into paediatric neurology services remains unpublished, with CHI rejecting its findings. We also have the audit into the waiting lists and equity of access the Minister mentioned. We have here evidence of over a decade of failure and findings that need to be implemented. We cannot have this inquiry stop this reform. All these recommendations need to be implemented and lessons need to be learned. That work needs to continue.",

Úna Keightley, cofounder of the spina bifida and hydrocephalus paediatric advocacy group said CHI is not an entity that values transparency, that it functions on a reactive basis to political, media and advocacy measures and that it does not follow any rules in terms of giving parents the information about their children. It knows parents have nowhere else to bring their children. I have seen this in terms of some of the parliamentary questions I have submitted to CHI. It refused to answer questions saying it was almost too busy to answer my questions. I sent them back and we had to push back on that. That is not acceptable. We need greater transparency and accountability from CHI.",

There are 233 on CHI's spinal waiting list and 139 on the active list, up from 112 in January, and 45 waiting longer than six months, up from 37 in January. Just five children are listed for surgery abroad. In total, only 19 children have availed of surgeries abroad. I want to know why this is so low. The Minister said it is a source of frustration but we need more than that. We need to know why it is not happening and every mechanism and tool at our disposal needs to be used to ensure these children get the surgeries they desperately need. They cannot be left waiting months and sometimes much longer.",

However, there are concerns about the delay with the external review panel. That cannot be delayed too long. There are also concerns about the lack of accountability and transparency. The Minister said in July regarding referrals to the Medical Council that her Department had written to the HSE to clarify the matter and the HSE had contacted CHI. Will the Minister update us on those referrals to the Medical Council? What is possible in relation to those cases? We need greater accountability. Legislation for accountability is crucial. That is a part of the Sláintecare reforms that was never done. It should be done.",

How many children and parents in continuous contact with CHI have been forgotten? Why were these children failed? Who is to blame and who will be held to account?"

Long waiting times have resulted in children no longer being able to get surgery because their condition has progressed so much. They do not get to enjoy school, playing sport or hanging out with their friends without the worry of medication, pain and hospital appointments, or, even worse, no hospital appointment at all. My heart goes out to the family of Harvey Morrison Sherratt and all the children and families who continue to be affected by a lack of care for scoliosis and spina bifida. They deserve better from this State and we must deliver better.",

In the face of repeated failures and the promise years ago from Deputy Simon Harris that no child would wait longer than four months for surgery, and in every new revelation about how these children and their families have been let down, most frustrating is that all this suffering is entirely unnecessary. We are an incredibly wealthy country with billions of euro going into our health service. We have a national focus and public backing for issues to be addressed. We have a plan to fix the problems in our health system and to introduce an efficient, public and robust healthcare system in Sláintecare yet we still have children becoming inoperable because they have waited so long and children in pain while their families watch on given we seem to want to hide from our failures instead of addressing them. Children's Health Ireland has been plagued with scandal, with each new detail worse than the last. We have clear systemic problems in our health service when children are being implanted with non-medical grade devices, when unnecessary hip surgeries are performed on children and when children who do need treatment cannot access it or are removed from waiting lists without their or their families' knowledge. These revelations came out piece by piece. We need a public inquiry that delivers for those affected and the publication of all reviews. We should not have to be here to talk about what we can do to give these families justice and services. They should have received timely care but it is left to us now to deliver on the broken promises and ensure change.",

However, it is incumbent to speak of the hundreds of children still waiting for spinal operations that are time-sensitive. In October, CHI reported 223 children on a spinal surgery list. Around 140 of them are actively waiting. That means they are ready for surgery but still have no date. Some children have been waiting more than 18 months. A very small number have waited more than three years. For a child, three years can change everything. No one should spend their childhood waiting for essential surgery.",

Additional surgeons, nurses and specialist staff have come on board and new theatre spaces and a new MRI have helped speed up care. Children have been sent abroad when needed and that has offered timely treatment for many families. These steps matter and I welcome them but progress is still uneven. Capacity has improved yet cancellations continue to disrupt families. Communication gaps leave parents unsure and anxious and too many children continue to wait far too long for surgery that could prevent long-term deterioration.",

If we want to fix this properly, we need four things: accountability for delays; full transparency about waiting times and cancellations; clear communication so families know exactly where they stand; and follow-through on our commitments to reduce long waits. Promises must become practice.",

In the months that followed, Darragh underwent all required pre-op assessments, which were completed and signed off in early 2025 confirming he was ready for surgery and despite that, no date was set for that surgery and no further information was provided. His clinical plan was for surgery to take place before Easter 2025. That was considered the timeframe for the best possible outcome. That is why it mattered. This is a child that has already been brought through so much. He deserved the chance at a best outcome, but that chance has now been lost. As a result of the delay to surgery, Darragh's spinal condition has progressed. He now has a worsening lower curve while the upper portion of his spine has become auto-fused. At his most recent appointment, I was informed that the section of the spine can no longer be surgically addressed due to its complexity.",

These were at least two clear opportunities to put Darragh forward for potential care on an international pathway and both were missed instead. When we attended the clinic on 3 April, we were told plainly that there is no date and there is no timeframe for surgery. That is not waitlist management. That is abandonment.",

This is exclusion. This causes a fundamental and urgent question. What is the pathway for access to Blackrock Clinic, Morgan Stanley and Great Ormond Street Hospital? Who decides which children will be selected? It feels like my lovely son was simply overlooked, forgotten and that is something no parent should have to live with.",

Now he is starting to fall out of the system and he has still not got the surgery required for the problems he is now experiencing. I want the Minister to take note of this. When his mother went about getting the information from 2009 and the various other dates from then to now, she was made to ask for that information through all kinds of avenues. She got little or no help. No one reached out to her. No one understood or wanted to understand what she was trying to achieve. Now, this young man has carried the problems of his childhood through his teenage years to his life as a young man. How is that right? There is nothing the Minister can say to these parents this evening that will satisfy them in the context of dates and times and the reduction of the waiting list. However, I encourage her to read her emails. These emails have been sent to her by the parents. I urge her to respond, engage and prevent further pain for the families."

It is also about the really horrifying revelations from a whistleblower about the treatment of Harvey and the idea that he was palliative, and yet nothing seemed to happen in palliative care, and about what we heard at the weekend - that Harvey was \"not fit for a sneeze\", which is an awful way to speak about a young child.

I have been contacted, as I have mentioned twice on the Dáil record before, by an adult patient of this surgeon with many concerns. I am obviously not qualified to say whether there were problems but at the very least, given what we know, adult care also needs to be looked at.",

I previously referenced the email from the clinical director at Cappagh hospital about ending the multidisciplinary teams, MDTs, because of osteotomies not happening. I got a new parliamentary question reply saying that hip dysplasia and osteotomies are still only going back to 2010, even though we know that these novel osteotomies go back to 2002. It makes no sense to me.",
                "On another issue, the Minister might help me to get parliamentary question replies. I tabled parliamentary questions in early September about diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma, referred to as DIPG, a form of very aggressive brain tumour, and the number of biopsies that are happening. I am still waiting for answers to those questions from the HSE. It has come to my attention that Ireland may be doing an unnecessary number of these biopsies. There are many biopsies when other countries are not doing them, potentially with fatal results for children, so I am looking for answers to those questions."

I have known Gillian and, particularly, Stephen for just over a year, from before the tragedy with Harvey. We have to learn lessons from this because time and again, on so many issues, parents and relatives have had to campaign for years and years for justice on these questions. I remember saying that we would be in here and we would have a statutory inquiry. It should not have taken the death of Harvey to get this, because I wonder, had he not died, if we would still be here asking for this. We have to be honest about that. What if the whistleblower had not spoken out?",
                "I want to make a quick point about the inquiry and about the waiting lists. Participation in the inquiry has to be mandatory. Importantly, because this has been raised by parents, children who were affected by this should be allowed to testify. Many of them are older now and they should be listened to. That is really important. If issues are found in the process of the inquiry, they have to be dealt with there and then. You cannot just wait until the end of the inquiry because we all know that it could take some time.",
                "Parents have raised this. Does the Minister still have faith in the spinal task force, given how badly it has failed in its role? The paediatric spinal task force group was explicitly created to decrease the waiting lists. It had its first meeting in May 2024 and at that time there were 246 children on the waiting list. In October 2025, there are 223 and another 139 actively waiting for surgery. It has failed in its objective. It was complemented by the paediatric spinal surgery management unit. It is hard to get your head around all of these terms. That was meant to be in charge of managing spinal surgeries. That is the unit that is directly implicated with Harvey falling off the list. Whether it was a clinical error, as the whistleblower claims, or whether it was an administrative error, as a newer report claims, is irrelevant. That group of people still failed to treat Harvey. There are other examples of incompetence there, with ten children who were crossed off the waiting list by somebody under orders. That person apparently was disciplined for that when they were actually just carrying out an order.",

Of 52 approved posts, 34 have been filled. Is this another problem that we have? There is also the culture of staffing. Anyone using the term \"not fit for a sneeze\" should not be working in the health system, or it should be taken up with them how acceptable it is for people to talk like that.",
                "As to what needs to be done very quickly to bring down the lists, two things were raised: either requisitioning space in other hospitals in the private health system, which is packed to the gills with equipment and money, or sending children abroad. Yet, we find that only two children were sent abroad for treatment despite a ministerial order to give all parents that option. It has to be questioned why the lists are still so high after all this time."

These are families who do not have the luxury of waiting until next year for improvements. They need treatment now. As a GP, I have seen how timely spinal care can change the entire trajectory of a child's life, and that perspective shapes what I want to say today. Yes, progress is being made, but we have a long way to go before any of us can be satisfied. We need to be honest. Too many children have waited too long for spinal procedures. While some indicators are now moving in the right direction, nobody should pretend that the job is done or that families can suddenly feel reassured. They do not, and I do not blame them.",

Some 462 new cases have been added to the list this year, which tells its own story. We are adding cases more quickly than we are clearing them. Nonetheless, there are improvements. Some 68% of children are now waiting less than six months compared to 56% a year ago. The number of those waiting over a year has halved and outpatient lists have fallen by almost 50%. These are signs of a service that is trying to pull itself out of a very difficult period, but it is also a reminder that the gains are fragile and that the system is still heavily stretched, especially when one retirement or one ICU bed shortage can derail a week’s worth of surgeries.",

However, I will also say this. They need more support, more capacity and more consistent communication structures. Families cannot be left chasing letters, clarifications and updates. The various reviews, the HIQA report, the Boston review, the internal examinations and the ongoing Nayagam review are not comfortable reading, nor should they be. If anything, they show that oversight did not come soon enough. The audit into governance and equity of access is essential and, frankly, overdue. Families deserve transparency, not a maze of inconsistent processes and varying standards. The planned statutory inquiry into spina bifida and complex scoliosis services is a necessary step. It is not a tick-box; it is not a gesture. It must be a turning point.",

Governance changes must be matched with accountability and day-to-day improvements must be felt by real families. Progress is real but it is not enough. We need more theatre capacity, more consultants, better planning for surgeries and demand, and communication that treats parents as partners, rather than supplicants. If we want families to regain trust, we have to earn it. As a GP and someone who believes the health system should serve the most vulnerable first, I will continue pushing for urgency, honesty and accountability because these children deserve nothing less."

However, any time a child is waiting for spinal surgery is too long and, therefore, I have to share the following example with the Minister.",
                "A young child in my constituency has been recommended for surgery for over two years. They had pre-operation appointments in early 2024 and 2025. They were offered surgery abroad and were due to travel to New York for spinal fusion last March. However, the child's parents were then advised by the medical team that surgery in Ireland was in the patient's best interests. The family was assured that surgery could be and would be completed by summer 2025 because the child is only ten years old and was, therefore, classed as a priority case. In June, the family was informed that before spinal fusion could take place, additional surgery was also needed, even though this was first identified by MRI in 2019. That is a wait of six years before the surgery happened. I am happy to report that the surgery was successfully performed on 1 July, and by August, the child in question was ready for spinal fusion. A date for surgery was confirmed for last week, that is, not the end of summer 2025, but in November. Unfortunately, four days prior to that surgery date, the surgery was cancelled. That was due to an emergency case, which I can appreciate, but no further plans or details were given to the parents. We can imagine the feeling in the family at that time, and the child asking, “Why am I not an emergency case? I have been waiting so long.”",
                "Children and parents like the ones I have just spoken about are at their wits’ end. I appeal to the Minister to keep up the drive that she has brought to this role and to ensure her ambition is carried through. I understand it is a challenge, and I recognise the work she has done up to this stage. The children of Ireland need that drastic change to happen at speed so they can access the treatment they so desperately need. The prolonged waiting needs to stop."

Her child does not qualify for scoliosis surgery because the curvature of his spine is not considered severe enough to join the waiting list. If he lived in England or America, he would be on the waiting list for surgery.",

The most severe cases are on the waiting lists but these children are left waiting for months, if not years, for urgent treatment and surgeries. The boy’s mother believes early intervention will give him the best opportunities in life and the best chance to correct the curvature of his spine. The system is in chaos while parents hear about scandals over springs and hip operations. How can parents trust the clinical decisions they are hearing about right now? The woman’s son is losing out because he was born in Ireland, and he is also losing out because he was born in Cork. I will explain why. He has two choices at home: to be in his wheelchair or to be in bed. There is nowhere else for him to be. He does not have a second chair, a specialist chair, in which he can sit, watch television, have meals or play games. What kind of system are we running when a child who uses a wheelchair cannot access another suitable chair? These are basic necessities for children who have disabilities. This is all wrong. How are we running the health service like this? It should be based on need, dignity and clinical decisions, but instead it depends on where someone lives. Is it a postcode lottery? This parent told me she knows of other parents whose children do have access to the equipment I have mentioned.",

That promise was broken, with devastating consequences. Right now, 139 children are actively waiting for spinal surgery this year. Four hundred and forty-six surgeries were completed, yet 462 new patients joined the list. We now know that the pledge of four months was based on assurances given to the then Minister by HSE leadership and senior officials at CHI, who told him the target was achievable. Those assurances were wrong and parents paid the price. The tragic death of Harvey Morrison Sherratt and the allegation that he was removed from the waiting list because he was deemed palliative have shattered public confidence. His parents have been clear that they want a statutory public inquiry with full powers to compel evidence and broad scope to uncover systemic failures over decades, accountability in respect of those who made harmful decisions, and above all, real change with ring-fenced funding, stronger governance and a national spinal treatment service so no child will suffer like Harvey did. The Government has now agreed to an inquiry, but this cannot be a box-ticking exercise; it must be family led, transparent and fearless in exposing the truth. When it concludes, its recommendations must be implemented, not ignored. I ask those on the Government benches to commit to implementing in full every recommendation of the inquiry and guaranteeing ring-fenced funding and a timeline for reform. Anything less represents another broken promise. There can be no more broken promises and certainly no more preventable tragedies."

                "We in Aontú have difficulties regarding this inquiry and, first of all, how it refers to complex scoliosis. There is no definition of complex scoliosis in the document so far and we are worried that this is an attempt to water down the number of children who will form part of that inquiry. I am also disappointed that the statement announcing the inquiry was first seen by the advocacy groups of these children in the media.",
                "How many children have been removed from CHI waiting lists without their parents’ knowledge? I will ask the question again: how many children like Harvey Morrison Sharrett were wrongly removed from the waiting list? How many children have died while awaiting surgery in this country? How many children have been removed from the waiting lists without surgery having aged out? Outside of the inquiry process, will the Minister commit to furnishing this House with that basic information and detail, which should be available at any stage to any TD who is asking a parliamentary question of the Minister? The Boston report said that one child went back for 33 surgeries but, because of CHI data, it looked like 33 children were operated on. There is a lot of confusion and a lack of transparency in relation to these figures. Given all that has happened here, the very least that the citizens of Ireland, elected representatives and these families themselves are entitled to is transparency."

I was here earlier but I had to step out for a while. I will confine my comments just in case my colleagues thunder in, but I can jump back if necessary. I will consider five As, like an A rating. The first A is that consideration be given – the Minister has even addressed one already – to the asks of the parents and advocates of the children. The second is to acknowledge the conscientious and hardworking healthcare professionals already involved over the past 13 years, and probably longer. The third A, which is probably the most serious and one, to my science background mind, I consider the common denominator no matter what subject of healthcare we discuss here, is to always get the why. What has happened and, more importantly, why has it happened? It is that issue of accountability, particularly the accountability of senior HSE management. If we look at the mission statement and values of the Health Service Executive, they are listed as care, compassion, trust and learning. We have had a breakdown on several fronts in that regard. That is a key area. The fourth A is action. Again, that is linked to the first A, namely, the asks. I ask the Minister to consider the 2024 scoliosis Bill brought forward by Senator McDowell because the accountability is built in. The fifth A is, to go back to the beginning, to acknowledge the efforts of the Minister in a short space of time against a system that is stacked against her."

Obviously, that was a no-brainer given they could not travel by aeroplane because of their condition. I suggested at that time that if we were serious about this, we would get some specialist surgeons from the United States or wherever and bring them here to deal with the backlog and waiting lists. I do not have to remind the Minister of what her party leader and current Tánaiste promised and what happened there. Money went in and it was ring-fenced, but it turned out it was not ring-fenced but, rather, was used up elsewhere. What kind of out-of-control HSE health system do we have? It seems to totally lack in compassion and empathy. There are many good people involved. My late brother was a paediatrician of some renown and he cared deeply. I know many health people do but it is the management. “Management” is such a bland word. How can these systems be so callous and unempathetic in how they deal with people on a daily basis? How can they see a problem and just walk away from it? It would not happen on farms. It would not be allowed to happen. It is so devastating for families. We saw loss of life and how files were wrongly entered or classified. It is so simple to say that but it is so deeply hurtful, sad and troubling to parents, anyone with a heart and anyone who is human.",

CHI is not fit for purpose by any means, nor is Tusla, but we keep piling on, giving them more and more money, adding more directors and letting them all have big fancy titles while the basic, decent humanity of a required surgery cannot be done in a timely manner. If we do not have the expertise here, we should be importing it from abroad and trying to show some compassion. Otherwise, we should fold up our tent in here and go away. We are like a Third World country. It is shocking. It hurts me deeply to have to talk about it."

I commend the advocates who have long been calling for a statutory public inquiry into spina bifida and complex scoliosis services. I cautiously welcome the fact the Government has agreed to this. The reason I say I cautiously welcome it is because the terms and references have to be spot-on in this. We have all heard about the unregulated springs used in operations of children and the unnecessary hip operations, so we need to find out from a governance level what actually led to these failures in the first place so that they do not happen again. We simply cannot allow the wreckage of the past and a toxic culture in CHI to take hold in a new CHI hospital.",
                "The scope of this public inquiry must not be too narrow. We do not need to see little bits of the jigsaw but, rather, the whole picture. The public inquiry must look at this and it must be able to compel people to appear to simply get the answers. Documents must also be compelled to help the inquiry. The facilitator appointed to consult stakeholders must be independent and he or she must ensure that no cohort or particular group of children are left out of this process. We need to have an overall view of the care children have received. This includes an investigation into the deaths of children and whether these deaths are linked to waiting on scoliosis surgery. The inquiry must also look at children who have post-op complications, including infections. The inquiry also needs to look at HIQA’s role in all of this and why it did not sound the alarm bells sooner. We need to see full accountability.",

They have tirelessly campaigned, both before Harvey passed away and since his untimely death, for better healthcare for children. Last year, I asked in this House why Harvey was removed from the waiting list without his parents’ knowledge. Today, as we speak, Stephen and Gillian still do not have an answer to this.",

This is totally unacceptable. We just need to get to the truth of this matter. Why was Harvey removed from the list, who knew about it and when did they know about it? This is about what happened at CHI level and at Government level. It is not about a witch-hunt or anything like it. It is just about finding out what happened so that it does not happen to another child. Harvey's case must be a reminder that management and political failures have real-life consequences. We need to see full accountability. The statutory inquiry should be how we finally get justice for Harvey."

The technical draft of the more quantitative audit element being done by the internal auditor will be technically available in December, but there is always a procedure to triple-check - I cannot recall the audit phrase - when producing data of that kind. That will happen within December. We will publish it as early as possible outside of the normal quarterly cycles, but that has to happen.",

The paediatric spinal task force is an entity separate to the management of lists within CHI. I think it is important to say that. Regarding its membership, Mark Connaughton SC the chair. Exceptional advocates for spina bifida and scoliosis are on the task force. There are also exceptional advocates who are not on it. All of them are contributing to the improvement of services. I thank all the advocates, both those on the task force and those not on it, and they will all contribute to the development of the terms of reference. They all have direct lived experience, either as a parent or as somebody with spina bifida or scoliosis. They all have very important perspectives and all have done exceptional work. The members are Gerry Maguire of Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus Ireland, Elaine Kelly and Deirdre McDonnell of Scoliosis Awareness Support Ireland, and Lily Collison of the Cerebral Palsy Foundation. There are then different departmental, HSE and CHI representatives.",

I thank them for their work. It is ongoing work. It really has contributed valuable information, as have those advocates outside of it. Neither is better. Everybody is contributing their experience for the improvement of services. I really do thank all of them. It is important to say the task force has no operational oversight. I think Deputy Coppinger may simply have confused the two elements, but the task force is not responsible for operational oversight. It is a group to try to improve the services. It is different from the unit established in CHI last year that is responsible for managing the waiting lists.",
                "The issue of the inquiry, possibly most important, was raised by several Deputies. I need to try to address a number of different issues, but what we can say with certainty is that it will be a statutory public inquiry. It will have the power of compellability, of necessity. We will also continue to try to drive improvements at the same time. Those things are not incompatible. We will absolutely engage with families, with children, in a voice-of-the-child appropriate way, and with stakeholders, the different representative groups and the different advocacy groups, all with a view to developing the best possible terms of reference.",
                "If I may say so, Deputies have said a couple of slightly competing things that I think it is important that we together address. We want an inquiry that can have the power to investigate the issues of shared concern to us. We also want it to be an inquiry that will report and have teeth. It is a fact-finding inquiry and, therefore, we cannot take things necessarily as they are happening if the chair of the inquiry has to go through their own process. We are moving into a legal process that has to be managed by the chair of the inquiry. We will not be able to interfere with the inquiry and nor should we. It is also a legal process that is capable of legal challenge. As we are drafting the terms of reference, we do not want them to be so tight that they do not do the work we want them to do. Equally, we do not want the terms of reference to be so wide as to either run into legal challenge or get to a point where we do not ever get an outcome to the inquiry in an appropriate way. I am not time-binding it or limiting it in any way. I am just very conscious that in the past we have had discussion in this House about the need for an inquiry into a matter of significant and urgent public concern and it has taken many years. I am thinking of Siteserv, for example. As Deputies may agree, it went considerably beyond the terms of its discussion.",
                "I am not trying to limit this inquiry in any way. What I am trying to say is that it is the Government and the Oireachtas that both set and sign off on the terms of reference. In every way imaginable, that will be done in collaboration and agreement with the advocates. There will come a point, however, where we will have to agree that we are reaching the best possible position for the functionality and legal robustness and endurance of an inquiry capable of challenge, that is, one that is going to be operationally effective and possible for the person chairing it and which will reach the sort of outcomes and findings that will be found. If I do not say this now, and if something happens to the inquiry in six, 12 or 18 months, the Deputies will quite correctly say that I did not set up the terms of reference properly. I am trying to set out at a very early stage the need for honesty and the understanding that we are operating within legal constraints that have important implications.",
                "I will work with the members of the health committee in a public and private way, for example, to try to outline all the different issues I see coming up. It is really important we have the advice of the facilitator. I suggest that we work together, publicly and privately, because it is the Government and the Oireachtas that sign off on it, to ensure we have the best possible expression of all the stakeholders that contribute to it and to take the steps with legal advice that we believe will give us the best and most robust model of an inquiry as well. I am just trying to set that out honestly. I do not want to walk into a brick wall with something we all know is so very important.",
                "There was a question about hip dysplasia. The chair was appointed on 24 October and that work will begin. I also understand CHI has written to patients in the last two weeks. It is important to say this to the House because I have this knowledge and I want to make sure I share it in the most appropriate way. I would like the opportunity to delve into this tomorrow but I do not want to withhold information I could give to the House.",
                "CHI has written to 81 patients who have been waiting longer than the period we would want to try to set out the parameters of international travel and how that might work, recognising, of course, that it has to be clinically appropriate and that it takes a certain length of time. There has, within the last two weeks, been an effort to engage in a different way with families and look at that international travel option. I will get more understanding of this as I meet with CHI tomorrow and over the next period but I think it is an important update for the House that I could not have and not share. I hope I have tried to address as many questions as possible and I thank the House."

Section 68 provides that a new section be inserted into the 2007 Act to provide the chief inspector with a discretionary power to carry out an independent review of a defined type of serious patient safety incident where some or all of the care of the patient was carried out in a nursing home. Prior to commencement, a query was raised as to whether the provisions of section 68, as it stood at the time, included public nursing homes. It is essential that public nursing homes are included. This was considered by the Department's legal department and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. As the current definition of a relevant designated centre does not include public nursing homes, these amendments are necessary to ensure that public as well as private nursing homes are covered by the provision and therefore to bring the section in question in line with the intent of the Act, which it currently is not.",

                "It is indeed, one of the more controversial things we will deal with today. The definition of \"relevant person\" primarily relates to Part 4. Part 4 concerns the secondary use of health information for specified public interest purposes, namely, a public interest purpose in the area of public and occupational health, policy and regulatory activities, including in respect of service planning and performance management, and statistics. Under this Part, the HSE will be empowered to request and receive from a relevant person health information for these specified public interest purposes. The provisions set out under Part 4 will, therefore, support greater and effective use of information and data, including in support of a number of activities. It is a critical step in ensuring we move beyond our current, often fragmented and even reluctant, approach to information sharing. These obstacles to information sharing remain in place. They do not serve the interests of the public. They frustrate our collective efforts to provide for health service improvement commensurate with the sustained and substantial public investment in health and social care. The Bill will provide a clarity in law that will allow us to surpass these obstacles and join other EU nations who have made more progress in digital health and social care.",

This amendment is, therefore, a technical amendment to clarify that a relevant person can fall under any one of those three categories. Deputies may wish to note that under Part 4, the HSE also has the power to specify, among other matters, the structured collection of health information to be provided as well as the digital format in which the information should be provided. Requests under Part 4 must be complied with and, in the event of non-compliance, the HSE can apply to the Circuit Court for an order directing compliance.",

The Bill is also clear as to the positive obligation it places on health service providers, including section 38 and 39 bodies, to provide this information when and as requested to do so. Of course, it should not be necessary to wait for legislation to be enacted to ensure there is a full alignment of reporting across our publicly funded health and social care services and to ensure an effective and efficient use of resources. This should be happening in any event under existing provisions and arrangements, including the service level arrangements that section 38 and 39 bodies are required to enter into with the HSE in return for the very significant levels of public funding received.",

The HSE is the funder on behalf of the taxpayer. There have been incidents when it has not happened and if we want consistency across all hospitals we need every hospital, including voluntary ones, to play ball.

                "From the perspective of the patient, I honestly believe the patient does not know whether he or she is attending a voluntary hospital or HSE hospital. If you are attending hospital due to a trauma or in a vulnerable situation, you honestly do not care whether the structure of the hospital to which you are presenting in need is a voluntary one or otherwise. Patients particularly do not care when they know that, as taxpayers, they are funding all of the hospitals. Indeed we are essentially funding all of the hospitals between 95% and 100%. There is simply no question that they are publicly funded and the staff are public servants. The background to voluntary hospitals is that they come from the days before when health services were in large part provided by religious orders and that is as may be. Many of them are providing a simply exceptional service with extraordinary clinical outcomes and research but they are nevertheless entirely funded by the public system and must adopt those structures.",
                "I set out some measure of reserve, as it were, to bring Seanad amendments because I am very conscious that there has been sustained engagement for a number of years on this and it has not happened. There has been sustained political direction and engagement from me and from the Minister for public expenditure in this part of the year and the service level agreement going into 2026 will be exceptionally clear as to the need to do this. However, I reserve some position because what I would like to see from the voluntary hospitals is communication to me about their timeline for this. It is incumbent on me to provide to the health committee or the public accounts committee a list of the voluntary hospitals, the budget each of them received in 2024 and 2025 and the number of public servants that are working there. I believe it is appropriate for me to be able to provide the Deputies with a timeline as to the implementation, hospital by hospital, of IFMS. I am not in receipt of information that enables me to do that at present. Were I to receive that sort of enthusiastic engagement from the voluntary hospitals within the next number of weeks, it would ease my path to providing that sort of accountability both to the Comptroller and Auditor General and to your good selves as the lead members of the health committee."

                "I think there is a difference of understanding in relation to the role of the board and the obligations of the board, who take their obligations under the Companies Act very seriously. Of course, the first obligation of any company director is to comply with the law of the land and to comply with the direction of the funders and shareholders, where that is appropriate within certain sectors. It is fair to say in the same way we have had the Health Information Bill, there has been a difficulty of engagement over different issues, whether it is sharing of patient data or the adoption of certain systems. There are already media reports of voluntary hospitals buying other systems that are not IFMS and it is the taxpayer who is paying for those as well so there simply has to be an alignment. It is fair to say I would not be doing this if there had not been a reluctance of some kind. That reluctance has been expressed directly to the CEO of the HSE, less so directly to me, but obviously the CEO and the chair of the HSE are working at my direction on Deputies' behalf and there has been a specified and written reluctance in relation to that. I have written directly to the CEOs or chairs. The Minister, Deputy Chambers, has supported that so there is very clear political direction on this and it really is up to those entities that are entirely publicly funded. They are staffed by public servants who will of course not just get public service salaries but public service pensions. They are entirely public servants. It is up to them to adopt the systems that in a small country help us to have visibility over how tax payers money is used, to have consistency and also better opportunities for realising savings and efficiencies through better procurement management."

More generally, it represents a critical step towards digitising our health services and this is crucially important. Digitisation is an area the health committee is quite interested in and one we will engage with the Department on and engage on during a public session.",
                "However, it is important to note the process of transforming our health service from paper files to digital files comes not just with benefits but also with risks. Privacy and security risks are unavoidable but the majority can be prevented by having the right safeguards in place. I accept that safeguards are being put in place via the Bill but ehealth represents a big change for our health service that will undoubtedly have teething problems. Significant and meaningful ongoing engagement with the Data Protection Commissioner will be crucial and more tangible action is needed given the sensitivity of the data concerned. This is why I believe it is essential a review is carried out early and that it is put on a statutory footing. We need to be sure the safeguards put in place are working effectively and that we identify areas for improvement early because the opportunities for breaches will increase as we digitise, particularly as new systems are implemented. As we all know, healthcare data is a prime target for a cyber attack. We should not discount the impact on AI on future healthcare provision either.",
                "I also have a concern regarding the level of preparedness in respect of the secondary use of data. Such use is vital for scientific research, policymaking and the development of treatments, but the State is poorly prepared to utilise it. In 2023, a pan-European steering committee stated that Ireland's infrastructure for secondary use of data will need to be built almost entirely from scratch and will be managed by people who are not yet on the payroll. I accept that the secondary use of data will be dealt with in future legislation, but all of these issues are interlinked. If we do not put these reviews on a statutory footing from day one, then I am not convinced they will happen. For those reasons, I am of the view that a review of data collection usage and storage needs to happen within 18 months."

                "I support the amendment, but I will pretty quickly make a point about the digital transformation of healthcare. This is something the Joint Committee on Health has spent a lot of time looking at over the past number of years. I will not rehearse all of the arguments, because we know we have a long road to travel. There is a direction of travel now with summary care records. It will take some time to get all the bells and whistles and electronic health records similar to those that exist in many other European countries. It strikes me that it is red tape that frustrates the system. I was in a hospital recently visiting a patient. We hear about patients on trolleys, but a trolley was rolled past me that was loaded with files. The nurse said that this is where we are in 2025. There were a huge number of patient files and records on that trolley. I do not know how any system could operate like that.",
                "I have also dealt with many cases where the families request the records of patients who may have passed away in circumstances where there may be concerns about how they were treated. Again, in the context of medical records, I sometimes wonder how things are not missed and how doctors and nurses can keep on top of everything in a paper-based system. I have to reinforce that point. We need to do more.",

Obviously, it will require funding. There is an amount of funding ring-fenced for this. The Minister cannot or will not say how much is involved because. obviously, contracts have to go out to tender. I accept that, but it is important for us, as spokespersons on health, to again point out the urgent need to invest in this area. There is or was a reluctance on the part of the Department of public expenditure and reform to invest in health, possibly and probably because of what happened with the personnel, payroll and related systems. Fingers were burnt in the past. We have to move away from that. We have to accept that the world has moved on and that everybody is using IT and digital systems now. The healthcare system has to keep pace with that.",

Consultation is specifically provided for in relation to data processing safeguards, ministerial regulations and HSE guidelines, among other things.

That has to be done in consultation with the Commissioner for Data Protection.",
                "The Health Information Bill complements and builds on the rights of natural persons provided under the GDPR in respect of their personal data. By way of example, it provides that a patient or their representative may restrict access by health service providers to all or part of their electronic health records, subject to being advised of the consequence of their decision. Importantly, if a health service provider accesses restricted information, the HSE has to keep a record of that and the reasons why it was accessed. Patients have the right, subject to some caveats, to obtain information on access to their records, the date and time of access, how it was accessed and the personal health data that was accessed. This is an important transparency measure to ensure patient confidence in the health record system.",
                "We can imagine the circumstances in which this may be important. If I was in long-term care in, for example, a particular hospital in Dublin and then was involved in a car accident in Cork and is brought to Cork University Hospital, which is a major trauma centre, I would very much want my electronic health records to be immediately available to the staff there in order that they could treat me in the best way possible. That is the huge advantage of electronic health records generally and of the sharing of information that is enabled by this legislation. It is not something that I would opt out of, but the Bill provides for people to be able to do that and to have that respect afforded to them, as long as they are advised of the potential consequences of doing so. We are not trying to force anybody to do anything in particular, but there are major advantages to the sharing of information in their own interests.",
                "It is also important for the Deputy to note that this Bill is the first of a suite of legislative measures to give full effect to the EU regulation on the European health data space under which member states are required to appoint a digital health authority to oversee governance of the primary use of electronic health data. Member states must formally appoint their digital health authorities by March 2027. As part of its role, the digital health authority must publish an activity report every two years. That report must contain the measures to implement the regulation and information on the percentage of the population with access to the various data categories in the electronic health records and on the handling of requests from individuals regarding the exercise of their personal rights under the regulation.",
                "The digital health authority will also be expected co-operate with a range of health stakeholders. This will include the Data Protection Commission. The authority will be mandated to accept complaints in respect of infringements and patient rights, and to immediately refer those to the Data Protection Commission. I am not sure if Deputies received an update on this, but I can confirm that it is intended to appoint the HSE to the role of digital health authority. The Bill provides the HSE with the clarity in Irish law that it will need.",
                "For all of these different reasons and the safeguards that are built in, I am not in a position to accept this amendment. I hope I have given the Deputy some comfort as to the level of detail of engagement the Data Protection Commission will have at all stages."

Digital literacy, access to technology and language barriers present challenges for some groups, such as, for example, older people, lower income households or migrant groups. The inability of certain groups to access their health data in line with legislation should be a real cause for concern. In 2021, the ESRI recommended the development of specific supports for vulnerable populations in order to address barriers to understanding ehealth, such as lower digital literacy and language competency. I accept that these supports may not be set down in legislation, but that does not minimise their importance. The Sláintecare 2025+ plan identifies health literacy as an issue and refers to developing a health literacy toolkit. That is very welcome, but I encourage the Minister to ensure there is a similar focus on digital health literacy.",

The Bill also provides for amendments to the Child Care Act 1991, the Family Courts Act 2024 and the Gambling Regulation Act 2024. Having brought the Bill before the House, the Government is satisfied the additional judicial positions are warranted to address the current demands being placed by the courts and to improve efficiencies across all our courts, providing a vital bulwark of our judicial system. The amendments to the Gambling Regulation Act and the Family Courts Act will provide for the more efficient operation of these Acts when fully commenced. I commend the Bill to the House."

Deputy Carthy has raised this with the Minister on numerous occasions. The absence of such a payment impacts on people already struggling with the cost of living, as well as those with caring responsibilities and the self-employed. Self-employed people and full-time carers can be excused from jury service but this means these groups are under-represented on juries. Simply speaking, those who wish to serve as jurors should not be out of pocket. Low income jurors face barriers due to inadequate allowances and the time commitment required. Deputy Carthy tabled amendments to the Bill but they were ruled out of order for some reason. It is important that the Minister makes a commitment to revisit this to make sure jurors are not out of pocket in order that they can take part in the judicial system."

                "I thank Deputy Ward for his contribution. This is an amendment that was mentioned previously by Deputy Carthy. The purpose of it is to try to provide for the payment to jurors of travel and subsistence expenses, and for reimbursement for financial losses incurred in the exercise of their responsibilities as jurors. It is important to point out that jury service is a very important civic duty. In many respects, it is a bit like voting. It is one of the requirements we demand of a citizen. Deputy Ward may say that when it comes to voting, it is something you can do in the space of half an hour or an hour but when it comes to jury service you can find yourself on a jury for very lengthy periods of time. I take this opportunity, by the way, to commend members of the public who have done such service on juries over the years because the criminal justice system could not operate without individuals serving on juries.",
                "No expenses are paid to people called for jury duty but they do get lunch and refreshments provided on a daily basis. There is also a requirement to ensure that employers continue to pay an employee while he or she is on jury service. Employers cannot say they will not pay someone called for jury service. There is a requirement for them to pay an employee while they are engaged in jury duty.",
                "I know also that section 9 of the Juries Act 1976 allows a county registrar to excuse a person from attendance. I have seen frequently, with the call-over of the jury panel, that jurors will approach the registrar and give circumstances and details as to why they say they are not able to serve on a jury. Sometimes the judge will hear this application as well. It is certainly the case for people who are self-employed, for example, those who run a shop on their own, that county registrars and judges take this into account and excuse people if it appears to be the case that it is essential they are not selected for jury service.",
                "There have also been a lot of improvements in the jury experience in recent years. There was the introduction of a digitalised jury summons. In fact, I got one myself recently. I responded to it and said I was not available. I was able to say I was excused because, as a Member of the Oireachtas, that is permissible. The Courts Service has also invested in the provision of improved jury facilities in modernised courthouses across the country. That is something we need to take into account. I want to ensure the jury room and the facilities for juries are appropriate in order for them to carry out the very important part of the criminal justice process. There are too many courthouses around the country where the facilities for jurors, practitioners and more importantly, litigants, are not up to standard.",
                "My Department is currently undertaking a review of jury service, which will be informed by research on the topic, including the Law Reform Commission's valuable report on jury service, as well as submissions made by the Bar Council and the Law Society and legislative and policy developments in related areas over the past number of years. The approach proposed by Deputy Carthy's amendment raises concerns as to how it will operate in practice. It would be a complex issue and would require processes and procedures to be put in place to ensure its efficient delivery. It would require additional resources being allocated to the Courts Service, as I am sure the Deputy can understand. The roll-out and operation of such legislation would require significant public engagement. I know the amendment has not been formally put down but since Deputy Ward raised it, I am not capable and ready at present to proceed down that route. As I say, there is research ongoing as to what can be done to facilitate further the importance service that is carried out by jurors."

                "This is a timely moment for An Coimisiún Toghcháin. Only days ago, we concluded our public awareness work for the presidential election - our eighth electoral event in 33 months. Technology is accelerating and expectations are rising yet the central question facing us remains constant. Artificial intelligence, like every transformative tool since the stone axe, brings significant opportunity and undeniable risk, but when placed within the delicate machinery of democracy, those risks become sharper and the responsibilities heavier.",
                "What do we talk about when we talk about AI? We talk about chatbots and deepfakes; synthetic text, voices and images; and extraordinary efficiencies and equally extraordinary vulnerabilities. We talk about how political actors might use AI, and how malign actors might weaponise it to distort debate or undermine confidence. Beneath all of that, however, we are really talking about one thing and that is trust. Trust is the foundation on which democratic legitimacy rests and in Ireland, that foundation is remarkably strong. Across a century, the State has built a widely shared belief that our elections are robust, lawful and independent. After November’s general election, 94% of respondents told us that elections are conducted in accordance with the law, 88% said they are well-managed and 96% expressed confidence in the secrecy of the ballot. These figures reflect decades of careful stewardship, and they represent a duty to protect that trust in every future electoral event.",
                "We are exploring how AI can strengthen our own work and how it might support future constituency reviews, streamline analysis or improve how we communicate with voters. However, our approach begins with key fundamentals. Ireland’s paper-based system offers transparency and resilience, if not complete immunity, to digital interference. Our electorate - and the political actors who serve it - is thoughtful, informed and deeply engaged. They deserve partnership, not paternalism, and the sheer speed and scale of AI-generated content mean that monitoring and labelling alone will never be enough.",
                "The final days of the presidential election illustrated this challenge vividly. A piece of AI-generated misinformation about the electoral process circulated rapidly and gained media attention. It showed how easily such content can be produced and how often we may see similar attempts. My friend and colleague, Tom Rogers, former chief executive of the Australian Electoral Commission, speaks of AI’s three Vs: volume, velocity and veracity. Information now moves faster, in greater quantities and with more subtle distortions than at any time in our history. Voters of all ages need support to navigate this new landscape. We will remain vigilant during the white-hot heat of election campaigns, where speed matters most, but our deeper task is to build long-term democratic resilience.",

                "At Coimisiún na Meán, we aim to develop and regulate a thriving, diverse, creative, safe and trusted media landscape. The advent of AI is likely to impact on each of those elements. A healthy media landscape empowers citizens to make informed choices about the media they consume and the ways in which they consume it. This means exposing citizens to a variety of voices and opinions, enabling them to identify reliable sources of news and to understand how technologies such as AI play a part in choosing what they see and hear when they engage with media through online platforms or smart devices.",
                "Democracy is one of the strategic outcomes set out in our initial three-year strategy. We want the media landscape to support democracy and democratic values, underpin civic discourse and reduce the impact of disinformation on our society. In the wrong hands, AI can undermine those aims. For example, the risks AI poses in this area include deepfakes being deliberately used to mislead voters, AI in recommender systems exacerbating echo chamber effects and amplifying the reach of misinformation and disinformation, AI being used to customise or target political messages in a manipulative manner, and AI chatbots being used as a source of news that produces content that is biased or inaccurate.",
                "We have already been designated by the Government as a fundamental rights authority and a market surveillance authority for certain provisions within the EU AI Act in Ireland. We are in regular contact with relevant Departments as the new functions are implemented in Irish law and as we plan how we can use our new competences to support a healthy media landscape. The new AI Act's risk-based approach prohibits a range of AI practices that undermine fundamental rights, including using subliminal or purposefully manipulative and deceptive techniques to distort people's behaviour in a way that might cause harm or exploit vulnerable users such as children. There are also transparency obligations falling on providers and deployers of limited-risk uses. They include requirements for AI systems designed to interact with people to inform them of this, such as chatbots or chatbot assistants, and the labelling of AI-generated or manipulated content, such as deepfakes or AI-generated news summaries. This will apply to online platforms and broadcasters, among others.",
                "Under the EU's Digital Services Act, platforms are obliged to remove illegal content once they become aware of it or otherwise risk becoming liable for it. The largest platforms have further obligations to assess and mitigate a set of systemic risks arising from how they are designed and used. They include actual or foreseeable negative outcomes for civic discourse and electoral integrity. The risk assessment and mitigation obligations have been further specified with a set of guidelines for platforms in times of elections. New rules for online platforms mean those that show political advertisements must have clear labelling showing who paid, what targeting techniques have been used and specifying the election issue to which the advertisement relates. Platforms that do not allow political advertisements must enforce this restriction proportionately and consistently.",
                "To ensure audiences are exposed to a variety of voices, views and opinions, broadcasters are obliged to make sure news and current affairs output is presented in an objective and impartial manner without any expression of the broadcaster's own political views. However, there are currently no corresponding obligations that apply to content feeds on social media or the output of AI chatbots.",
                "Different types of digital media now rival traditional media for influence and we consider that the time has come to consider how similar plurality obligations could apply to new media.",
                "Regulation is not the only tool for mitigating the risks that AI poses to civic discourse. At Coimisiún na Meán, we also oversee a host of media literacy initiatives to ensure that people can critically engage with and understand the media they consume, regardless of whether it is on TV, radio or online or generated by humans or AI. We want people to be aware of trusted sources of information and how to find them so that they can recognise fact from fiction. It is not our role to tell people what to think or say; our role is to ensure that they have agency to make up their own minds, free of manipulation or deception. There are other public bodies with important roles to play here, for example An Coimisiún Toghcháin, which has a role in providing electoral process information, ensuring that people can exercise their democratic rights. We also have journalism schemes, which are an important way to ensure there are trusted sources of information on matters such as local democracy.",
                "In summary, at Coimisiún na Meán, we want to use the tools at our disposal to ensure that the deployment and use of AI systems benefits people, while ensuring that any negative impacts are effectively addressed through regulating and supporting the development of a healthy media landscape. As the impact of AI becomes clearer over time, there may need to be an assessment of whether other rules need to be updated to reflect changing consumer media consumption patterns and habits arising.

                "My first point concerns the general use of AI in government. With the widespread popularity and rapid penetration of AI into contemporary social and economic life, governments have come under significant public pressure to incorporate AI into their operations. This is on the basis that AI will bring efficiency and productivity to activities and bring new insights to bear on policy problems, while also enhancing the capacity for objective and data-driven decision-making. A report in September by the OECD on the use of AI by governments internationally identified many risks but also noted the risk of not engaging with AI to yield benefits and develop capacities.",
                "Although there is greater recognition of the different types of AI, that is, symbolic, deep learning and generative, AI is primarily a data-driven technology that operates by distilling patterns from large historical datasets into decisions. This implicitly encodes a decision-making paradigm underpinned by historical records, one that seeks to ensure continuity and consistency. These attributes make it more appropriate for some policy sectors than others. In sectors with a volatile policy context, such as policing, trade or immigration, the logic of AI may not be as applicable when compared to sectors such as education, health or housing.",
                "An uncritical or inappropriate adoption of AI across government may precipitate unintended, undesirable or even harmful consequences. The adoption of AI should be informed by a careful consideration of the trade-offs between reliance on historic decision-making patterns and sensitivity to the concrete circumstances around individual decisions.",
                "On AI leading to changing modes of decision-making and accountability in government, major advances in the scale and pace of government operations during the 20th and into the 21st century were, in general, transparent and subject to public accountability mechanisms. AI stands in contrast to this as it offers recommendations based on complex data patterns, with the underpinning logic of the recommendation being more opaque than transparent. This presents obvious challenges for the role of public servants, especially as ever more consequential decisions are subject to AI-informed considerations. Public servants may find themselves having to explain why they do not agree with an AI recommendation and there is the danger that the pathway of least resistance is to uncritically accept AI-generated decisions.",
                "It is important to recall that the design of AI has emerged from the corporate sector. With the market economy being driven by logics of utilitarianism, that is, the greatest good for the greatest number, rather than concerns about democratic inclusion, AI technologies embed the utilitarian calculus in their operation. For example, the training process of deep neural networks seeks to minimise average error, which is a paradigm that does nothing to prevent a small number of cases from being heavily disadvantaged.",
                "The opacity of AI-based decision making also poses some fundamental problems for democratic accountability. The Government, and by extension public services, are accountable to Parliament and the people at large.",
                "This encompasses the ability to ensure that each decision and the process of how the decision was arrived at hold up to public scrutiny. Different forms of AI present different challenges, but, essentially, there are issues concerning how information is generated and used.",
                "As the committee will be well aware, ensuring effective regulation of AI is a challenge faced by most governments, not least because large technology companies have global presence which makes jurisdiction-specific regulation hard to institute and enforce. The EU has pioneered legislation, such as the GDPR and the AI Act, that has significant implications, but these remain only preliminary steps towards ensuring that AI serves the public good. Efforts towards AI regulation ought to include transparency mandates for usage within critical sectors so that key decisions remain amenable to scrutiny, challenge and rectification, as necessary. The influence that AI firms wield presents a lopsided power equation where citizens may feel caught in a binary, finding themselves caught between using AI subject to terms they may not find acceptable or not using it at all. Governments around the world have found it difficult to hold AI firms to account. Such is the pace of change that it has been a case of catching up rather than setting the regulatory frameworks and democratic guardrails within which AI must operate. We therefore really welcome the work of this committee and thank it for the opportunity to speak."

                "AI has an adversarial relation with the truth. As has been referred to, the core of its calculations are correlations not causal relations, so its outputs are plausible rather than factual. Google's Sundar Pichai was in the news this morning, backing me up on that point. I would describe AI’s pattern recognition as a form of computational conspiracy theory, and its outputs are disinformation even when they appear to be accurate. AI’s internal opacity and its inability to parse social complexity make it impossible to remove errors and bias. While a belief in AI’s superior powers persists, its claims to truth will retain authority while harming some of the most marginalised, which has also been mentioned. Even the engineers who build AI cannot explain what is going on inside to produce a particular result, so reliable regulation on that front is a non-starter. At the same time, the efforts to make AI more reliable actually make it more effective at selecting preferred versions of truth. The claims we hear that AI will solve everything from climate change to infectious disease deflect attention from the actual uncomfortable truths of our current moment. This hubris is driving an investment bubble, which Mr. Pichai also mentioned, that diverts vast sums from real social needs.",
                "On democracy, it is increasingly clear that AI is precaritising rather than productive. It cannot really replace people but it can make their circumstances more vulnerable. AI is, in fact, extending forms of austerity prevalent since the crash of 2008 while preparing a new financial crash of its own. These conditions are corrosive to democracy. AI is also anti-democratic in terms of institutional and regulatory capture. We are currently seeing the EU walking back the flagship AI Act in the face of pressure from Trump and big tech. Peter Thiel, the founder of Palantir and patron of J.D. Vance, is currently on a lecture tour saying attempts to regulate AI are the work of the Antichrist. Meanwhile, the example of DOGE demonstrated AI’s effectiveness as a form of authoritarian cyberattack on centralised institutions. More broadly, AI is toxic to democracy via its impact on education and young people, as our colleague from the Electoral Commission will know. Large language models are sold as learning accelerators but actually substitute slop for critical thinking. Unfortunately, they are becoming young people's first port of call for everything from essays to relationship advice. In this context, AI undermines the replenishment of a citizenry with the capacity for independent thought. In its systemic effects, AI will fail to solve problems, cause collateral damage and benefit reactionary politics.",

                "AI should be considered harmful to whatever polity is hosting it. I suggest that the committee should at least be clear with itself what it is endorsing when it endorses AI. At best, the alleged benefits to healthcare or education really amount to algorithmic Thatcherism. A more likely outcome is that widespread AI adoption will strengthen the far right. I encourage the committee to see AI as a symptom rather than a cause and to use it as a diagnostic for the underlying problems of a system that needs some restructuring for the benefit of people and planet. Having said that, AI is an actor in its own right and one that will intensify real world problems like energy costs, unemployment and militarisation. Therefore, I also encourage the committee to place worker and community collectives at the heart of decision-making about AI, with a clear power of veto. This should also apply to the expanding number and scale of energy-hungry and recolonising data centres. Decision-making around AI should prioritise alternative solutions that reduce the overall dependence on computation and elevate direct social relationships.",

A social media feed is not the same as a broadcast. The role of the platform is not the same. They are not the editor in the way that a broadcaster is, but they have a big role in selecting what is in the feed. For example, under the European Media Freedom Act, there is something called media privilege.

Under the Digital Services Act, those have been identified and when platforms have children as their users, they are required not to have addictive design features and not to promote content that is unsuitable for children, such as pornography. I absolutely agree with the Deputy that we can look at recommender systems and see how can they be designed to make sure that when a feed contains material that is relevant to civic discourse, that material in the feed that gets recommended does not just put one point of view but puts a balanced point of view, that it contains trusted journalism and that the algorithm does not reflect the political preferences of the owners of the social media company, all of which would be analogous to the obligations we put on to broadcasters."

I found Mr. Godfrey's comments that An Coimisiún na Meán is keeping a watching brief on this very interesting. As we move into this area where AI is more prevalent and the recommender systems are making those decisions as to what our citizens should see, it is even more important that we hold the broadcasters responsible for content, such as RTÉ, or legacy media as it is referred to and trusted media as we find it, accountable for what they publish and amplify.

Also, they lose their exemption from liability once they have actual knowledge. Once An Coimisiún Toghcháin told them about this, they had then lost any exemption from liability. Under the AI Act provision, which is not yet enforceable, there is an obligation to label deepfake content. Once they know there is unlabelled deep-fake content on their platform, if they allow that to stay, they would then be in breach of the AI Act. That is not until sometime next year, but we will have a responsibility or a function involved in enforcing that. There was an earlier question asking what more was needed.

Does he have data behind that statement? Is there a reason he considers it a valid claim? Depending on the audience, I would have thought people's feeds or streams are, in fact, much more influential. Will he elaborate on that particular point?"

As a result, it is important that we make those things happen. Recommender systems do have some utility for users. When they are configured with the sole aim of maximising engagement, they do not keep users safe. As we have seen, they promote rage bait and echo chambers. In addition, the content that users engage with and are attracted by is not necessarily healthy."

You have the corporate presence and power, which, to some extent is already beyond regulation and demonstrates that repeatedly but, more fundamentally - and this is in relation to the technology itself - they have a form of technology, the AI algorithmic systems, which is essentially going to introduce deep fakes and ranking systems of a certain character and type into the very functioning of the state. Therefore, it seems that when it comes to the issues that are now being reflected, the proof of the pudding is in the eating. People have eaten it in terms of social media, and the question is whether they are going to eat it in terms of the rest of the systems they are in. This is going to introduce the stuff into the very systems themselves. Not only that, it is going to be done by shovelling a lot of public money at it at a time when the companies are talking about the fact that the whole AI industry is greatly overvalued. This is going to be done at considerable cost in the context of climate impacts."

Also, when you go on Twitter there are people treating Grok as a font of wisdom and truth, whereas the witnesses are making the point that they are not about finding truth. They are about finding plausible rather than factual things. What are the wider implications of this for our democracy? If you can ask ChatGPT how you can fix your car or how you should fix your broken toe, then you can presumably ask Grok or ChatGPT who you should vote for.

That was because it had been directly interfered with by its owner. That is a florid example and easy to dismiss. What I am really concerned about is the issue of education. As an educator, I can tell the committee that universities are on the front line of this issue. The constant narratives about how safe these systems are being made are really narratives about how to make this exact effect, just more subtly. What you are really introducing are powerful influencer systems, which seem to be a common concern of committee members. You are introducing a powerful but opaque influencing system into pretty much every question that everybody has about daily life."

The primary piece of research was from a group of researchers that included Microsoft researchers. Microsoft is very involved because it is the partner of OpenAI, which is the company that produces ChatGPT. It did the initial research showing that how the overuse of these things in workplaces led to a reduction in people's capacity to think. We only have to ask anybody who works in a university or in a school right now about the kinds of effect that this is having. This is very much an after the horse has bolted situation. I am not a regulator or policymaker, but it is clear that, unfortunately under current conditions, society seems to have abandoned the idea that there should be a critical consideration of technologies before they are widely introduced. It is not too late in the sense that AI is not the end of it. As we all know, this thing is rapidly changing. A reconfiguration of the idea of regulation rather than trying to land it on everybody after it has already happened, and trying to get ahead of the game and say that technologies that influence society on a wide scale should be critically subject to social sanction and democratic critique before they are allowed to be released on society, would be a good start."

On the other hand, the more people get involved with corporate social media, the more misinformation ridden it becomes. That could be due to various reasons. One of the possible reasons could be that its ownership model is not profit oriented. We talk about disinformation quite a bit. Disinformation also happens because there is somebody profiting from it, not just by means of electoral outcomes but by means of real money. In other words, somebody is making money out of the engagement that it generates, etc. If we have systems that have their motives right and maybe people working in the interests of societal good rather than for monetary benefit, maybe we will get to nice systems."

As I alluded to at the beginning, the mode of processing does not have any factuality or causality in it. What you are really looking for in these things is not just a carefully curated dataset but a situation where essentially unreliable information is functional, which applies to a fairly narrow range of things. You are really looking for a situation where only the form of the output is important. It could be imagined that, in some very limited situations of language learning, a language model like that might be useful because it is more about imitation.

You cannot really control what they are doing, if that is what sovereignty means, or rely on the outputs. Stepping back a little bit to the more political economy side of it, there are a couple of problems. One is the narrative around sovereignty and the way it has evolved. All of the big companies are, in a way, offering sovereignty as a service at the moment. They have cottoned on to this, at least since 2022 or 2023. The big companies like Google, Microsoft, OpenAI, Amazon and some of the other large language model companies are saying that they will provide sovereignty. They say they will provide governments with control over data, privacy, compliance and all of these things while eliding the fundamental relationship, which is that these are services they are then in control of providing to you rather than something you actually control."

We must consider several factors about where that money is coming from. Certainly, in the UK, which I know more about than I do about Ireland, most of those companies are not being taxed at all. The money being generated is, in essence, free money that then recycles through the venture capital system. The reason venture capitalism is so important comes from the kinds of measures that were taken to allegedly deal with the financial crisis of 2008. That is what freed up a lot of the money going into venture capital for all these speculative investments. There is a lot of unpicking to do but I really do not think the fact these companies have the money and power at the moment should be a starting point for how any state or sovereign entity should deal with the issue."

These systems operate by way of rules so we can trace the provenance of the decision back to a particular aspect. It is a little bit like industrial automation. If a printing press is not working, we can drill down to determine which particular part of the machine is causing it to break. In that sense, we can work backwards and find out which rule caused it to fail. There are those kinds of AI systems that have an inherent transparency to them, in contrast to the systems that we have now like large language models. Maybe LLMs could imbibe some sort of flavour of those and there are explorations in that direction. Dr. McQuillan talked earlier about small LLMs and there are ways of infusing human knowledge into LLMs in a very transparent way. There are explorations but it is still early days."

It may not necessarily be AI. There are algorithms and so on that might be able to help us speed up this process. After we report, the Oireachtas has to legislate to introduce them. The Venice Commission says there should be no changes to constituencies for at least a year in advance of a general election. There is a particular challenge here that we have to deal with. We have not settled on what it might look like. We also have to do the local electoral area boundaries, the Dáil constituencies and European Parliament constituencies within that very compressed period. If I can offer the Deputy some reassurance, it is to say that I do not think there was a single constituency of the 43 where the first option lasted and was sustained over the seven members of the commission looking at it. There are so many tweaks, etc. There is no benefit to first-mover advantage in the context of that simple crunching of the numbers the first time out."

That is such a universal narrative, wherever we look. It certainly is in the area of higher education. People say there is this AI thing that they can turn to. I would say it is always a point at which people should be asking, and this does rise up to the legislative level, what else they could do.

We ought to mind that the technology is socially constructed in the sense that a technology that is built elsewhere may not be applicable as much to the concrete realities of the place we are in. That also speaks to the discussion on alternatives. Maybe there is a place to start small. Maybe there is a place to have a small technology office within the Government to build bespoke AI technology for a particular public service. Maybe we will see the challenges we are facing there and maybe that will bring up the contrast between the AI that is out in the market and the AI built within the Government and maybe that will lead us to somewhere we might not be able to foresee at this point."

At the moment, we are in a situation where people do not know what is true. In fact, the whole concept of truth is being undermined. If ours is a society that can at least agree that there is such a thing as truth, even if we disagree about what the truth is, that is really important. That is what is what is fundamental here."

Chuir mé é sin in iúl don Uachtarán. Dá réir, molaim do Dháil Éireann ainmniúchán an Teachta Hildegarde Naughton le ceapadh ag an Uachtarán le freastal mar bhall Rialtais. Ar mholadh an Tánaiste, an Teachta Simon Harris, tá sé i gceist agam an Teachta Harris a ainmniú mar Aire Airgeadais, an Teachta Helen McEntee a ainmniú mar Aire Gnóthaí Eachtracha agus Trádála agus mar Aire Cosanta, agus an Teachta Hildegarde Naughton a ainmniú le freastal mar Aire Oideachais agus Óige. Chomh maith leis sin, beidh mé ag moladh don Rialtas an Teachta Emer Higgins a cheapadh mar Aire Stáit ag freastal ar an gComh-Aireacht agus táim sásta an Teachta Frank Feighan a ainmniú mar Aire Stáit ag an Roinn caiteachais.",
                "I wish to inform the House that the President, acting on my advice, has accepted the resignation of Deputy Paschal Donohoe as a member of the Government. I intend to assign the Department of Finance to the Tánaiste, Deputy Harris. I intend to assign the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Defence to the Minister, Deputy McEntee, and the Department of Education and Youth to the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton. I intend to nominate the Minister of State, Deputy Higgins, to be a Minister of State at the Department of Children, Disability and Equality with responsibility for disability. She will attend Government meetings. I intend to nominate Deputy Feighan as Minister of State as the Department of Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation with special responsibility for public procurement, digitalisation and egovernment.",
                "I would like to congratulate Deputy Donohoe on his appointment to such an important role in the World Bank. This appointment is a tribute to the impact he has made in three important ministerial roles over the past decade as well as his work as president of the Eurogroup. He is only the fourth person to hold that role and his election to it for three terms showed the deep esteem in which he is held throughout Europe. This appointment is also a testament to the high regard in which Ireland is held due to the active and positive work of members of Government in international institutions.",
                "There are those who seem to assume that Ireland’s standing rests on how loud we speak. The truth is that it is actually based on the much harder work of countless hours spent building relationships and showing our values through constructive work with others. Paschal’s work on our behalf and on behalf of all the people of Europe deserves our thanks, respect and appreciation. He was also a tireless advocate on behalf of the communities of Dublin Central, dedicating himself to the work of promoting investment and structural change, as well as improvement to the quality of life on the ground.",
                "On a personal level, over the past five years I have enjoyed working closely with Paschal during some of the most challenging times faced by our country and by the European Union. He was a central part of policies which helped us to emerge strongly from the fastest recession and the largest public health emergency recorded in modern times. Although he was proud to represent his party, he always treated his colleagues from Fianna Fail and Independents with respect and understanding. He was always motivated by a belief in the values of our democratic Republic and those we share with other democracies. He was also very useful for giving you the odd tip on a book to read from to time.",
                "Over recent decades the role of the World Bank has changed radically. It has become a dynamic force for helping find new ways to overcome poverty and tackle disease. It is by far the largest funder of innovation in the field of development and its positive impact is felt in countless communities throughout the world. I wish Paschal, Justine and their children all the very best for their future. I know he will represent Ireland with distinction in this important new role.",
                "The changes which I am proposing to the membership of the Government and ministerial responsibilities concern important roles. However, these changes are being made in the context of a very clear set of priorities which define the work of our term.",
                "Following the mandate we secured in last year's general election, the parties and Deputies that support the Government resoundingly endorsed a comprehensive programme for Government to be implemented across five years. While we unfortunately have many in the House who cannot bring themselves to respect the mandate of others, we will continue to fulfil ours.",
                "We have already prepared and put in place the largest programme of investment and development in our country's history through the national development plan. Comprehensive action on speeding up the delivery of housing has been prepared and is being implemented. We have completed our first budget, giving priority to developing essential services, developing infrastructure, supporting those most in need and protecting our economy in the event of a downturn, and the Finance Bill has almost completed its journey through the House. We have also responded to rapidly changing international conditions, working to ensure Ireland has the foundations in place to secure our economy and social supports. These are defining parts of our work this year and will continue. As Minister for Finance, the Tánaiste, Deputy Harris, will, with the Minister, Deputy Chambers, move forward the Government's plans and our commitment to securing social and economic progress.",
                "Deputy Helen McEntee will move to the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Defence at a critical moment. While we will formally hold the Presidency of the Council of Ministers from mid-year, work on our commitments as part of the Presidency is already well under way, as is our active work in promoting a just peace for the Palestinian people and the people of Ukraine and Sudan. The invitation for me to attend the G20 meeting in South Africa is a reflection of the high standing of our contributions to international debates and of the fact that the country is already a key part of various critical discussions. I am determined that Ireland will continue to have its voice heard on vital international issues and on promoting a positive agenda for the future of Europe. Holding the European Union Presidency is always a significant challenge for smaller countries. It requires a large amount of attention, but the benefit to the country of a positive Presidency is always significant.",
                "We will also push forward our plans to improve our ability to defend ourselves against very real threats. Investment in our Defence Forces and defence capabilities will remain a priority. I look forward to working closely with Deputy McEntee during what is already an intense period of activity in European and international affairs. I have no doubt that her extensive experience of the Council of Ministers and operations at the highest level of the European Union will have a positive impact. She was formerly a Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.",
                "Investment, reform and inclusion in education are central to our programme for Government. Deputy Hildegarde Naughton will bring extensive experience to the role of Minister for Education and Youth and is in a position to have immediate impact. The agenda in the Department of Education and Youth is an exciting one. It involves completing important curricular reform, which will ensure we update what we teach and ensure high quality. Our programme of dramatic investment in the quality of educational facilities will continue to accelerate, as will our implementation of major reforms to the level and nature of critical supports for children with special needs. A new model of provision of key therapies in special schools is proceeding and will be an important part of the new Minister's work in conjunction with the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Moynihan. Given her past work in this area, I know that Deputy Naughton will make an important contribution to a new era in special education. The Tánaiste and the Minister, Deputy Chambers, will continue the fiscal and economic underpinning that will enable us to implement all these important plans.",
                "It is a proud day when any person is nominated to serve as a member of the Government of a democratic republic. I wish Deputy Naughton well in her new role. I congratulate her and acknowledge her family and supporters in Galway who have worked hard for her over the years. I also congratulate the highly regarded Deputy Frank Feighan on his elevation to the office of Minister of State. I know this House will receive his appointment well.",

He has presided over ten budgets as either Minister for Finance or Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, which, if not quite record-breaking, is an extraordinary achievement in any modern parliamentary democracy. He has also served as Minister for Transport and Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, where he established himself as a highly effective and trusted Minister. On the international stage, he has been elected as president of the Eurogroup on three occasions, which makes clear the extremely high regard in which he is held by colleagues across the EU. In the constituency of Dublin Central, Paschal won and repeatedly held a seat for Fine Gael time and again. He did so through his sheer personal effort, hard work and the characteristic bond he has built with his constituents to whom I know he has been deeply committed.",
                "He has performed all of these roles with an acumen that has led to a unique level of public trust in his steadiness, steeliness and stalwart dedication to this country's economic well-being. His calm stewardship helped to guide Ireland through some of the most challenging periods in our recent history, including Brexit, the Covid-19 pandemic and a period of major global economic uncertainty. His prudent management of the public finances has underpinned Ireland's recovery and growth, ensuring that our economy remains resilient and our society continues to prosper. Of course, those of us who work closely with Paschal on a personal level know that he brings to the job a determined and undimmed optimism, unflappable good humour and exceptional collegiality and friendship. We are immensely proud of all he has done and of his latest achievement as he becomes managing director and chief knowledge officer of the World Bank, based in Washington DC.",
                "It is impossible to find words for how much we will miss him as a friend and colleague. I can only wish my good friend, Paschal, along with Justine, Oscar and Lucy, every happiness and success in the next chapter of their lives. He should know that we will always be here for him and we will always count him among our friends. Paschal, go raibh míle maith agat agus comhghairdeas.",

I will move to the Department of Finance, where my commitment is working with the Minister, Deputy Chambers, to continue to steer Ireland's economic policy; to continue our record level of investment in infrastructure while we reform delivery; to pull every lever we can to deliver increased housing supply; to wisely manage our resources to deliver better public services as our population grows; to protect jobs and back businesses and farmers; and to save and plan for the future in an uncertain world. I look forward to working closely with the Minister, Deputy Chambers, and the Taoiseach in the time ahead.",

This appointment will come at a time when Ireland's place in the world and our relationships with Europe, the United States of America and our nearest neighbours in the UK and further afield have never been more important. It is a moment of great geopolitical upheaval and instability, but one in which Ireland has been and must continue to be a calm, reliable voice for diplomacy and dialogue. I know that the Minister, Deputy McEntee, will continue to be a strong voice for that approach. It also comes at a time where we are preparing for Ireland to hold the Presidency of the Council of the European Union in the second half of next year. I look forward to working closely with her and colleagues across government on what will be a significant period for Ireland and its place in the EU.",

I know she will continue to develop the national education therapy service, increase the number of special places and SNAs, increase teacher supply overall and drive forward our new school building programme, which is needed for our growing population.",

We have been able to provide record levels of investment and we must now match that with record levels of effort to deliver continued success.",

We must continue to be prudent as we face geopolitical headwinds and potential economic volatility. We have run budget surpluses for the past three years, and we must continue to make the right political choices in the years ahead. We must be balanced and we must be responsible but we also must know that the security of our economy depends on investing in the ingenuity of our people. So, with every decision we make in the time ahead, we must continue to invest - invest in our people - protect jobs and enhance our economic competitiveness.",
                "Having served as Taoiseach, as a senior Minister in five Government Departments and as a Minister of State in the Department of Finance, having chaired the Cabinet committee on the economy and having chaired the Government trade forum, I am looking forward to taking on the role of Minister for Finance, and working with colleagues across government and across the Oireachtas on economic policy and keeping this country's economy secure. For me, economic prosperity and social cohesion go hand in hand, and I know that is a value we share across government. We must manage our public finances responsibly and equitably for our citizens. As per the programme for Government, we will use windfall receipts to address strategic infrastructure deficits, never for the day-to-day, and we will continue to build up our long-term savings funds to help this country withstand future shocks. Should that shock come, I, and the Government, will always cleave to two principles: we will continue to build and we will continue to protect our public services.",
                "I look forward to preparing a new medium-term fiscal plan with colleagues - the Minister, Deputy Chambers, in particular - setting out a budgetary path to anchor sustainable public finances, deliver progress on the economic and social priorities of the Government and protect the long-term prospects of our country.",
                "I know that when developments like today's occur, it can be a moment of intrigue and it can certainly be a moment of shock but it will not be a moment of interruption. There will be no pause in the momentum we must demonstrate in the business of Government. There is always more to do. We will meet the challenges which confront us now, just as we have done in the past. Let us get on with the job."

                "I rise today to pay tribute to my colleague, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, on the occasion of his departure from Cabinet. It is an important moment for this House and the country because it marks the close of a remarkable chapter in public service, one defined by stability, integrity and an unwavering commitment to the Irish people. Paschal Donohoe has given incredible service to this State since he first entered the Dáil in 2011. His contribution stretches across more than a decade of national decision-making, including some of the most challenging periods in modern Irish economic history. I want to place on record my sincere best wishes to him, both personally and on behalf of the Independent colleagues whom I have the privilege to lead in Cabinet.",
                "It was an honour to serve alongside Paschal in the Cabinet of the Thirty-fourth Dáil. As Minister for Finance, he brought a steadiness that never wavered, even in moments of deep uncertainty. His approach on every issue, large or small, showed the same calm judgment and the same respect for the process of government. His leadership was instrumental in guiding Ireland through some of the most testing economic conditions in recent times. During the years of Brexit, the Covid pandemic, global inflationary pressures and significant geopolitical instability, Paschal’s voice consistently brought reassurance. He had a deep understanding of the Irish economy but, more importantly, he understood the people behind the numbers - the families, the workers, the businesses and the communities whose well-being depends on sound and careful economic management.",
                "His stewardship of the public finances gave this country confidence when confidence was badly needed. He demonstrated that economic competence and compassion are not competing values but complementary responsibilities. He was clear, he was principled and he was honest, even when the advice he gave or the decisions he had to take were difficult. That integrity was recognised at home and abroad.",
                "On a personal note, I will miss working with Paschal. We first worked together during my time in the Office of Public Works in 2016. From that period on, I came to know him as a straight-talking, highly capable and deeply committed colleague - somebody who listened carefully, considered every viewpoint and never sought credit for himself. What mattered to him was the outcome, not the headlines. Around the Cabinet table, Paschal always focused on the long-term consequences of decisions. He had the discipline to look past the political cycle and keep sight of the broader national interest, a quality that is essential.",
                "His presence brought balance, his contributions brought perspective, and his approach brought civility to debates that often occurred under significant pressure. His record speaks for itself: budget after budget delivered stability, restored confidence in Ireland’s public finances, strengthened international relationships, including within the Eurogroup, where he earned enormous respect, and demonstrated the ability, year after year, to keep Ireland on a sustainable economic path while also ensuring the State could invest in housing, public services and infrastructure on a scale that simply would not have been possible without sound financial management.",
                "As he embarks on the next stage of his career, I wish Paschal every possible success. I hope the years ahead bring him the same sense of fulfilment that his years in office have brought to this country. Ireland’s loss is the world’s gain.",
                "The Tánaiste, Deputy Simon Harris, now takes up the mantle of Minister for Finance, a challenge he will no doubt rise to. The Tánaiste is an extremely experienced voice at the table. His previous roles will solidify his position. In fact, his first ministerial role was as Minister of State in the Department of Finance in 2014.",
                "Deputy Helen McEntee, who is beside me, is now Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and Minister for Defence, and I congratulate her on her role, a role I know she will bring a wealth of experience and expertise to. She is no stranger to the foreign affairs side of things, having previously served as Minister of State for European affairs.",
                "My fellow Galwegian Deputy Hildegarde Naughton now assumes the role of Minister for Education and Youth. I am truly delighted for her. She has been the Government Chief Whip, a role she carried out extremely well, and she comes from a role as Minister of State in the Department of Children, Disability and Equality. In fact, she is also a former Minister of State in my Department, the Department of Transport. She will bring another strong female voice to the Cabinet, which is very welcome.",
                "I also congratulate Deputy Frankie Feighan, my friend from Roscommon, and Deputy Emer Higgins on their new roles. I assure the Tánaiste, Deputy McEntee, and the Minister, Deputy Naughton, of my full support and that of the Independent colleagues going forward. We wish them the very best of luck in their new roles.",
                "From a Government perspective, over the last number of months we have launched a new housing plan and a revised national development plan, which will be the root of our nation over the coming years. The updated national development plan provides unprecedented levels of investment to secure Ireland’s future, unlock housing, upgrade water and energy infrastructure, deliver more roads and provide more public transport. The housing plan, launched just last week, is a major step towards tackling the housing challenge through practical action, reform and investment. Together in government, we will continue to accelerate our housing and infrastructure goals, and the changes in Cabinet today will solidify that. This is a Government of intent and implementation. Back in January, when my Independent colleagues and I decided to go into government and agree a programme for Government to deliver change-----"

                "Today, we must confront honestly the record of the Government he leaves behind, a record defined not by service or ambition but, rather, by a relentless commitment to clinging to power at all costs. This Government came into being on the back of a grubby deal with Deputy Michael Lowry and his associates, and it certainly shows. It was an arrangement that allowed them to attempt to play both Government and Opposition at the same time, if you recall. It was a deal born of desperation for office rather than dedication to the Irish people.",
                "From its first moments in office, the rot had set in. From day one, the focus of the Taoiseach and his colleagues was on not solving problems but consolidating privilege. Its first act was the appointment of the largest number of super junior Ministers in the history of the State, with enhanced salaries, enhanced perks and enhanced comfort for themselves. They are literally tripping over each other. There is that many Ministries that it would make your head spin.",
                "Then, of course, came the bike shed scandal, and after that, it was scandal after scandal, culminating in the deeply traumatic and, indeed, devastating scandal surrounding the failure of young Harvey Morrison Sherratt, who was left to wait and wait and suffer agony. There was no four-month timeline for him, Tánaiste. Harvey lost his young life. It is a painful reminder of the system that fails a child and not alone him, fails families and not alone his, fails communities and not alone his, and then, worst of all, fails to own up to it.",
                "While the Government was consumed by scandals of its own making, the crises facing ordinary people were left to spiral out of control. Nowhere is this more evident than in housing. We have the worst housing crisis in the history of the State, with record homelessness, record rents and soaring house prices. Entire generations are locked out of home ownership, trapped in extortionate rent or forced abroad. Young people are told by the Government’s actions, despite all of the windy rhetoric, that in the end their future lies somewhere else.",
                "It does not end there because this year, the Government delivered a budget of €9.4 billion and, astonishingly, it managed to leave working people worse off. That is some achievement. While people are struggling to keep the heat on, pay the rent, fill their shopping trolleys and put petrol in the car, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael chose to give a €250 million tax break to developers and a €105,000 tax break for wealthy executives but nothing for ordinary tax-paying workers. Increased tax breaks were given to landlords but renters were left out in the cold. There were no cost-of-living supports for workers, no income tax cuts for ordinary families and absolutely no relief for those under huge pressure literally just to get by. In fact, instead of helping people, the Government’s budget and decisions actively make life harder by taking away energy credits, scrapping the double child benefit payment, increasing the price of petrol and diesel, hiking student fees by €500, increasing road tolls, increasing the local property tax and enabling runaway rents to rise even further. You could not make it up.",
                "Workers and families are being hit from all sides and the Government is the one swinging the hammer. People are now afraid to turn on their heating despite the cold. Does the Taoiseach know that?",

Does he know that working people on decent wages are struggling too? Does he know that families have cut back on essentials? Does he know that the anxiety for them is constant? All the while, they have to listen to Government members backslapping each other, in the grip of delusion, insisting that things are fine. Things are not fine. This is not leadership; this is delusion.",
                "The Government's ongoing attempts to undermine our position as a military neutral are both short-sighted and dangerous. Most of all, they are in defiance of the will of the Irish people. If the Government thinks I am wrong, it should put the matter to a referendum and find out."

It has been a legislative wasteland. It is a Government functioning on fumes and a coalition that governs by press release, not by law or action. This may well be the worst Government in the history of the State, because no Government has presided over such a combination of record crises, hollow promises and stubborn inaction. Working people, children, disabled people and carers pay the price. Let me tell you who is paying the highest price. It is Ireland's young people, that is who. It is young workers locked into eye-watering rents, students paying higher fees, people in their 20s and 30s with no hope of buying a home, and young families squeezed by childcare costs. It is the Government's failures that push them to leave this country in their droves. Any Government that fails its young people has failed Ireland.",

This is action that can be taken right here, right now today.

Similarly, on a personal level, I send my best wishes to the newly reshuffled Ministers, Deputies Harris and McEntee, the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton and the Ministers of State, Deputies Higgins and Feighan on their elevation. I welcome the fact that we will now see more women in Cabinet. I welcome the fact that for the first time in Irish history, we are going to have a woman in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. That is very welcome.",

After less than a year in office, it shows the Government has no coherent programme of policies for the future; indeed, it seems the Taoiseach and the members of Government have no confidence, not even in themselves. There is no other way to describe so sudden a departure of such a senior Cabinet member less than a year after Government formation. It is a clear expression of lack of confidence. It demonstrates a crisis of confidence. Earlier this year, I remarked that the Taoiseach has become a very tetchy Taoiseach. I think he is now being joined by a rather twitchy Tánaiste and a fleeing finance Minister."

That matters because a government that lacks stability cannot offer hope. All of us feel the need for hope among the people and the communities we represent - people who feel the reality of the housing crisis or the sharp end of the cost-of-living crisis, people with less money in their bank accounts at the end of the week or the month, with grocery and energy bills, insurance, rent and mortgage costs rising. Thousands of families are being driven into debt. Another generation of young adults face emigration. Thousands of children are on waiting lists. Some 300,000 households are in arrears on electricity bills.",
                "This is a Government of failure that has no answers. It had no answers from its inception and it has no answers now. A lastminute.com change of personnel does not provide new answers. The Government is a conservative coalition cobbled together in three parts: two Civil War enemies, uneasily united and relics of a bygone era, with a third leg made up of the so-called Independents, the western alliance, and a Lowry leg of this wobbly stool uneasily united by Deputy Michael Lowry, a man found to be corrupt by a tribunal who literally gave two fingers to the Dáil. This reshuffle brings back all those rather bad memories for all of us of that unedifying spectacle.",

We saw that in the October budget, which was a gift to burger barons and big builders, as Deputy Nash said, with reckless tax cuts, massive giveaways to corporate chains and nothing for working families. We need an alternative politics that delivers massive State-led investment. The Labour Party mission is for an active State. That is why we believe we need a left-led Government. We saw a real appetite for that sort of alternative politics and alternative Ireland in the landslide win, just two and a half weeks ago, by Catherine Connolly in the presidential election. In her campaign, she united the parties of the left and other parties comprising people who see the need for an alternative vision and for an active State that can provide for those in need, that can build homes, tackle the cost-of-living crisis and provide public services and those climate action measures that seem to have slipped off this Government's agenda but are so patently necessary to secure the future for our children and grandchildren.",

There is ongoing uncertainty with Trump's tariffs and trade tantrums, and a winter of rising bills and stagnating wages ahead of us. That is why we need a strong and secure programme for change, a programme that will guarantee greater security to households and secure lives and livelihoods. Changing the names on the doors in Government Buildings will not provide that security or hope for the future. The Taoiseach's coalition, it seems, will continue to govern with an approach that smacks of more of the same. Maybe the Minister, Deputy McEntee, will finally pass the occupied territories Bill in full by Christmas, as we in opposition have been pressing for the Government to do. Maybe the Minister, Deputy Naughton, will address the scandal of the thousands of children waiting for assessments of need and for school places, the lack of places for autism services and all of those issues that Cara Darmody and others have been bringing up so frequently.",

It is a so-called new housing plan that was nothing more than old milk in new bottles and so little hope for those locked out of homeownership. A locked-out generation is being told to hang in there at the same time they see annual housing targets simply removed from the plan and at a time we see 5,000 children in homelessness, which is a national disgrace.",

When the figure at the top of the Department of Finance changes, the dynamic of a Government and the relationship between the Minister and the Department of public expenditure changes as well. That access is really important. Under the Tánaiste, this dynamic, of course, will change. One of the most unjustifiable and unwarranted tax cuts in decades was made in budget 2026. It is contained in the Finance Bill and it is the nonsensical VAT cut down to 9% for the hospitality sector. This tax cut, at the expense of working people who will pay more tax next year as a result of this, has the Tánaiste's fingerprints all over it. In fact, the only people who seem to think that boosting the bottom line of burger barons was a good idea was Deputy Harris, the new Minister for Finance, and the Minister for Enterprise, Tourism and Employment, Deputy Burke. I have said time and again, based on all of the evidence and actions of this Government, and its previous iterations, that this, and the previous Administration's, reputation for responsible fiscal management is wholly unwarranted. The Minister, Deputy Harris's, 9% VAT rate cut proves that point. We cannot have more of this. If we get more of the same from the incoming Minister for Finance, the economy is sure to hit the rails. This VAT cut alone makes me wonder about the incoming Minister's judgment on economic affairs, what we may expect and what may lie ahead.",

A responsible Minister for Finance would ensure as well that they would do something that has sadly been lacking in recent years, which is to make our budget-making system more transparent that there would be more accountability to this House and to Dáil committees on how we spend the public's money because budgets these days are quite simply works of fiction.",

I want to sincerely wish them all well in their new roles. I welcome that the gender balance at the Cabinet table will improve somewhat. I especially congratulate the Minister, Deputy McEntee, on being the first female Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.",

Even with this change, the number of women at the Cabinet has just been restored to where it was at the last Government. That is important to note. It is high time we saw more progress and more diversity in general at the Cabinet table.",
                "People watching at home today will see some changes to the Cabinet but will they notice any change in their own lives after this reshuffle? There are so many people out there who are under enormous pressure and they want to know what these changes will mean for them. Will a new Minister for Finance signal a new approach from the Government that intends to take the cost-of-living crisis seriously and provide supports to those struggling with that crisis? Will targeted energy credits now be introduced? Will we see more action to get transparency and accountability for soaring grocery prices? Will we finally see the Government take on supermarkets and force them to publish their profits? Will the scourge of child poverty finally be tackled? Last year the number of children living in consistent poverty doubled. Will those children finally be lifted out of poverty so they have a chance of reaching their full potential?",

We had a housing plan last week that delivered more of the same. Will changes to the Cabinet today mean any change in approach there, so the delivery of social and affordable homes is finally turbocharged? What I increasingly notice when I speak to people about housing is the despair that so many people feel. People feel trapped and they feel helpless. They have run out of hope that things will change for the better. Will this change at Cabinet signal anything to them that change is coming or is it just going to be business as usual?",
                "The issue of disability services is something that the Social Democrats feel very strongly about. Ireland is a wealthy country but we continually fail disabled people. The treatment of disabled children and their families is simply outrageous. Just today we have had new figures that the number of children overdue an assessment of need has now exceeded 18,000. When those children are finally assessed, what will happen? They will be put on waiting lists of up to 13 years to get critical therapies and supports. They are, therefore, waiting to get on another waiting list. It is truly shameful. I do not think that anyone in government would actually disagree with me on that but if they wanted to radically change that today, they could have appointed a senior Minister for disabilities, someone at the Cabinet table whose singular focus is disability services and improving them, someone who is going to take on the huge waiting lists for assessments and services, someone who will guarantee that every child has an appropriate school place and, crucially, someone who will ensure disabled people are treated with dignity and can live full and independent lives. Unfortunately, that decision was not taken today. It is a missed opportunity.",

The Minister has, for the first time, actually acknowledged they will be missed. Incredibly, he does not seem to want to do anything differently, or nothing that I can see. We are on course to miss our targets and incur billions of euro in fines from the EU for doing so. Perhaps the new Minister for Finance will act rationally and invest that money into climate mitigation, public transport, renewable energy, retrofitting, and sustainable agriculture instead of using it to pay the enormous fines we could have avoided.",
                "I could continue for the rest of the day to list areas that need reform and investment because the truth is the country is not working for too many people in too many ways. However, it does not have to be like that. We are a wealthy country with so much potential that has yet to be realised. The crises we face in housing, in healthcare, in disability services, in childcare and in nature are not inevitable. They are not written in stone. They can be tackled and they can be surmounted but we need an acknowledgement from Government in its new incarnation that what they have been doing is not working, that the wrong political choices caused all of these crises and that the right ones can resolve them.",
                "For people out there who are watching at home and feeling a huge disconnect from the words they hear from Government Ministers and from the reality they see in their own lives of strained family budgets, of overdue bills, of threadbare public services and a lack of critical infrastructure, it is important to note that real change is possible. We saw in the recent election of President Catherine Connolly that this change is at our fingertips, that her hopeful vision for a new Ireland resonated across the country and that this vision can become a reality. The Social Democrats will continue to do what we have always done, which is to propose constructive and progressive solutions and continue to work to hold this Government to account, to work towards a change of Government and, ultimately, to work towards a change of approach."

It is worth examining what Paschal Donohoe's ideology has been and what it has meant. He is one of the more ideological and more considered figures within the political establishment in Ireland. What characterises the more general statements by the former Minister is to talk about the defence of the centre and that the centre must hold against extremes of left and right. He characterises himself as a centrist and Fine Gael as centrist, and presumably Fianna Fáil as a centrist. What does that mean? First, let us consider the extremes of left and right. The left are those who say that we should have decent access to housing for everybody, that we should have free childcare, that we should have a decent national health service and that we should have a society based on people's needs not profit. The right, of course, are those who want to demonise the most vulnerable, who want to burn down IPAS centres and so on but look substantially at this centrism Paschal Donohoe speaks of and what this Government has legislated for? Take the example of the last budget. This is centrism and this is what is packaged as what is sensible, normal and not very ideological at all. In one of the richest countries in the world with a record budget surplus, this Government and Paschal Donohoe decided to make disabled people poorer, and not just poorer in real terms but poorer in nominal terms by well over €1,000. This Government decided to make the poorest income group poorer by over 4% in real terms. It decided to make everybody, ordinary people, poorer by about 2% while giving huge tax breaks to big business. This is presented as sensible centrism.",

Google was able to knock on the front door, come in, meet the Minister for Finance and get a tax break of €300 million in the same budget that made disabled people poorer. This gets to the heart of what Tariq Ali has described as the \"extreme centre\". The extreme centre thinks that hard choices need to be made for the poor, the disabled and workers but if you are Apple, Paschal Donohoe and this Government will spend millions to fight for your right not to pay tax, if you are Google you get tax changes in order to minimise your tax liability and if you are a developer you get a massive tax break. This is why we need a fundamental change of Government and who the Government represents."

Their policies drive inequality and austerity all around the globe. They decrease workers' rights, environmental considerations and life expectancy in any country they go into. We have a situation where 1% owns more than 95% of the wealth according to Oxfam, and where a dozen men roughly have the same amount of wealth as half of the entire planet. This is the system the World Bank presides over and that Deputy Donohoe will also preside over. Regarding the debt burden on African countries, 18.5% of the income of Africa is spent servicing the debt which Deputy Donohoe will be presiding over as well. This is more than many of them spend on healthcare.",
                "I feel these points are very important because there is a lot of back clapping and wishing Deputy Donohoe well on his promotion but he has been rewarded for, I believe, being a loyal proponent of austerity and an implementer of it since 2014 when the IMF was in the country. He has presided over many budgets that really did inflict a lot of hardship. He is being rewarded for not implementing things like the occupied territories Bill and for recent budgets which, even though we are back in record surplus, disabled people and workers paid for very severely.",

Again, this is nothing personal but she has been in charge of special education for quite a number of years and there has been a severe crisis in that area. I am not inspired with confidence because there has been a huge crisis in the need for autism classes and facilities for people who are neurodivergent, which she has stood over. We need more than a reshuffle. We need a new Government because for the year it has been in power it has severely disappointed and made ordinary working people pay for the crisis."

He never held back in letting us know what he thought about our perspective on politics and economics. I am not going to hold back in saying that I think the legacy that has been left behind by the years of Fine Gael Government since I have been in the House, and Deputy Donohoe has been in the House, is not one to be proud of. He simply cannot escape responsibility for a disastrous and ongoing housing and homelessness crisis, which has plunged so many people into the misery of emergency accommodation, rotting for years and sometimes decades on housing lists and being crucified by unaffordable rents. Indeed, as reported by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul today, as we head towards Christmas and a cold snap record numbers of people in low-income and middle-income families are begging for help to get them through the Christmas months. This is from a Government that has record budget surpluses.",
                "The truth is that years of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Government have left us with this disastrous housing and homelessness crisis, with a cost-of-living crisis imposing misery and hardship on working-class people and on the least well-off, and with people with disabilities being forced, as we speak, to organise protests in the run-in to Christmas over what has been done to them in the most recent budget, which is taking €1,000 a year off them. The other side of the coin, and this is the so-called political centres legacy, is that under Deputy Donohoe's ministerships profits for the corporations have quadrupled. While people who are poor are suffering, to the extent of not even having a roof over their heads, the profits of the big corporations, the landlords and the vulture funds have gone through the roof. Energy companies are recording record profits while elderly people will be terrified in the coming days as this cold snap hits, afraid to turn on the heating because they cannot afford to pay the bills. They will not be getting a cost-of-living support during the Christmas period. Deputy Donohoe cannot escape responsibility for this legacy. The truth, I am sorry to say, is that the World Bank is an institution of global capitalism that, frankly, has a pretty dire record. It is located in Washington DC where it lends out money to poor countries; demands austerity and privatisation; and, essentially, serves the interests of American and western big business, often at the expense of some of the poorest countries in the world.",

It was presented as sensible and protective of growth, yet for many families it fell short, with modest increases of €10 in weekly social welfare payments, €8 or €16 for child payments and €5 in the fuel allowance. There was no meaningful cost-of-living package and no changes to personal income taxes. Meanwhile, housing remains in crisis despite €5 billion in capital commitments. The minimum wage increase to €14.15 barely scratches the surface of inflationary pressures. There were no energy credits for families and pensioners, who are still choosing between heating and eating.",
                "Disturbingly, buried in the recent budget is a significant, large unannounced measure, whereby the VAT rate on room hire, excluding hotel and guesthouse bedrooms, will increase from 13.5% to 23% on 1 January. This change, being introduced without clear communication, will impose a substantial financial burden on hospitality business. For example, one Cork hotel estimates it will cost approximately €25,000 annually if absorbed internally. To offset this, it would need to generate more than €120,000 additional gross revenue next year, a near impossible target in the current climate. This comes at a time when the minimum wage is set to rise by almost 5% and auto-enrolment for pensions is being introduced, adding further pressure to payroll costs. These combined measures place enormous strain on small hotels and rural businesses that are already struggling to remain viable. These establishments are not only commercial entities; they are pillars of their communities that support local events, charities and even political activities. Such hidden changes erode trust and fuel frustration among the electorate.",

I look forward to having the Tánaiste answer them all, in particular what was discussed in the Palace of Westminster on the report that came from the hidden financial credits and mis-selling of large financial funds in the British banking industry, including Ulster Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, RBS, and Lloyds, which was reported at the Palace of Westminster last week. I am looking forward to his views on that. As the new Minister for Finance, I ask that he looks at energy credits and looks again at the cost of living and the difficulties we are having. We have seen the rise of the cost of living.",

Noel Thomas has it covered for Independent Ireland and there is no problem there."

The Deputies should not be afraid of losing their seats because maybe they will have to lose them to do what is required. That is the way Government happens."

                "For almost 1,400 days, Ukraine has been subjected to an armed aggression, the likes of which had not darkened our Continent in decades. The actions of the Russian Government in invading the territory of a sovereign, independent state are an affront to humanity, conducted with flagrant disregard for the UN Charter and for international law. In the course of its military aggression, Russia has killed thousands of Ukrainians, occupied parts of the country, devastated towns and cities, deported thousands of Ukrainian children, has forced over 14 million people from their homes and has deepened the scourge of global hunger.",
                "Russia intentionally cripples Ukrainian infrastructure and tortures its servicemen. It has razed historic sites to the ground and, simply put, has sought to extinguish any Ukrainian future from this very earth. Russian drones and missiles target Ukrainian cities on a regular basis. Swarms of up to 800 drones per night terrorise the people of Kyiv and other cities. These are not the actions of a country interested in peace.",
                "In the face of brutal adversity, Ukrainians continue to demonstrate outstanding courage, resolve and determination. Today, I would like to honour their heroic efforts to defend their country and their freedom. Given our own history, nobody from Ireland could not feel a strong resonance with a people trying to defend their country from an imperialist oppressor that claims a right to subdue its neighbouring people and destroy their identity.",
                "Ukrainians have done nothing to bring down this war on their heads. They deserve the right we all claim to determine their own future, in peace and security. President Putin seeks to contort history such that an aggressor is somehow a victim, the imperialist is liberator and the oppressor is the oppressed.",
                "We cannot accept this tearing of the fabric of the international order and this perverse inversion of reality. We must return to the facts. Russia’s full-scale invasion was an act of unprovoked and unjustified aggression by an expansionist power against its neighbour.",
                "In 1945, the United Nations collectively agreed to say, \"Never again\" to the atrocities that follow from expansionist violence, yet now such atrocities have returned in Ukraine, Palestine, Sudan and in other conflicts. We cannot resign ourselves to inaction. We must not begin to normalise this inhumanity that the United Nations worked so hard to consign to history. We are seeing the rapid erosion of the fundamental basis for multilateralism with this conflict and with it threats to the integrity and credibility of the UN Charter itself. The example of a permanent member of the Security Council privileging imperial ambitions over global security threatens all of us and it threatens our collective future. It calls into question the capacity for the peaceful settlement of disputes and frays the common threads of our peaceful co-existence as member states of the United Nations. In this, the 80th year of the UN’s founding, Russian actions in Ukraine raise profound questions and challenges for the international community.",
                "If Russia is allowed to prevail, seizing territory it has no legal right to and causing untold death and destruction with impunity, this will simply further embolden it and give a green light for others to attempt the same. What happens in Ukraine reverberates across the globe. Such unprecedented challenges to the international rules-based order have necessarily been met with an unprecedented response. Ireland has been at the forefront of these efforts. At the United Nations, Ireland along with our EU partners, has supported every General Assembly resolution in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, including successful action to exclude Russia from the Human Rights Council.",
                "During our term on the United Nations Security Council, Ireland delivered consistent, principled and powerful criticism of Russia’s war and defence of the UN Charter and the people of Ukraine. Ireland will continue to use our position and voice in the UN and in other international fora to support Ukraine’s sovereignty, territorial integrity and the right to live in peace.",
                "As Ukraine withstands Russian bombardment, it is our responsibility as a democracy to stand with them. In defending their nation, Ukrainians are also defending the universal principles that underpin our multilateral system: the rights of all people to live peacefully within their own borders and according to their own values and choices. This is why Ireland, together with the European Union and its member states, have mobilised unprecedented levels of support for Ukraine since the start of the Russian war of aggression. Since February 2022, the EU and its member states have provided almost €144 billion in support for Ukraine. This has been in the form of macro-financial assistance, budgetary support, emergency assistance, crisis response and humanitarian aid, as well as military assistance.",
                "In February 2024, political agreement was reached on a €50 billion financial support package for Ukraine. The Ukraine facility will make available up to €50 billion in grants and loans until 2027 to cater for Ukraine's immediate needs, recovery and modernisation on its path towards the EU. Since February 2022, Ireland has committed over €380 million in political, humanitarian, economic and non-lethal military support to Ukraine.",
                "In response to Russia’s illegal aggression, the European Union has adopted unprecedented sanctions. The EU first imposed Ukraine-related sanctions on Russia in 2014 in response to its illegal annexation of Crimea and its role in supporting separatists in Donbas. Since the full-scale invasion, the EU has adopted a total of 19 sanctions packages against Russia. We must continue to exert maximum pressure on Russia and limit its ability to wage its war of aggression against Ukraine. A broad range of sectoral sanctions have been put in place, including measures targeting Russia’s military, technology, transport and energy sectors. Ireland welcomed the adoption of the 19th package of sanctions against Russia in October and will continue to support the use of sanctions to pressure Russia. Together these measures are having an impact, making it harder for Russia to access battlefield goods and generate revenue to pay for its illegal war.",
                "The decision by the European Council to open accession negotiations with Ukraine offers the prospect of a brighter future for the Ukrainian people. This year’s enlargement report confirmed that Ukraine has made significant progress on the path to membership in the European Union and reflects the results of systemic reforms implemented, despite all the challenges of the war. Ireland strongly supports Ukraine’s path towards EU membership. We will work to advance it under our Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2026.",
                "Ireland is a militarily neutral country. However, as we have said many times, we are not politically or morally neutral in the face of violations of international law and war crimes; quite the opposite. Our position is informed by the principles that drive our foreign policy: support for international human rights law, for humanitarian law and for a rules-based international order, and the rights of all countries to choose their own path.",
                "We are not neutral when Russia disregards all of these principles. We will continue to stand with Ukraine because Ukraine is fighting not only for its own survival, but in defence of European security and European values. Ireland recognises that its continued support for Ukraine is a necessity, not a choice. We are playing our part by providing non-lethal military support to Ukraine.",
                "Through the Department of Defence, we continue to provide direct military support-in-kind. In June, five air defence radar systems and a fire tender were delivered to Ukraine.",
                "A further donation of 34 vehicles, including ambulances, was delivered in two convoys in early September. Three Reacher bomb disposal robots were delivered to the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, UDCG, demining coalition in mid September. The Defence Forces will deliver a further training module of basic training to Ukrainian armed forces personnel via EUMAM Ukraine. This will take to 23 the total number of modules delivered by Irish personnel.",
                "Through the framework of the European Defence Agency’s EU SatCom Market project, we provided support to Ukraine in respect to provision of satellite communications equipment at a value of €1.36 million. Ireland continues to contribute to the European Peace Facility, EPF, for non-lethal military support to Ukraine. At EU level, the release of the majority of remaining committed funding under the EPF is currently blocked. To date this year, we have committed €100 million in bilateral non-lethal military support to Ukraine. In July, €10 million each was provided to the UDCG coalitions on demining and IT support, led by Lithuania-Iceland and Estonia-Luxembourg, respectively. The remaining €80 million is being used primarily for the procurement of non-lethal elements of air defence in co-operation with EU member states with whom Ireland has agreed procurement partnerships for this purpose. The Government is firmly committed to continuing this strong support for Ukraine and expects to announce a further substantial package of non-lethal support shortly.",
                "It is important to remember that while this war is being fought on Ukrainian territory, it is also a war on the Continent of Europe and against a country aspiring to join the European Union. It is perhaps easy to look eastward and believe the fires of war burning in Ukraine will never reach our shores and that distance is protection. Our commitment to a values-based foreign policy, multilateralism and a policy of military neutrality does not insulate us from the impacts of a rapidly changing and volatile international security environment that has become the new reality across Europe.",
                "Russia’s increasingly provocative and reckless campaign of hybrid activity is raising concerns and tensions across Europe. Russia’s war of aggression must come to an end. We continue to call for a ceasefire to allow for meaningful negotiations to occur, negotiations that respect Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Regrettably, instead of agreeing to sit at the negotiating table, Russia chooses to escalate its attacks on Ukraine. I call on Russia to cease these brutal attacks. We will work alongside the US and European and other international partners in support of efforts for peace. This is not just critical for peace in Ukraine, but also for Ireland, for Europe and for the wider international community.",
                "It is more important than ever that Ireland and our EU partners demonstrate our continuing solidarity to Ukraine in the face of Russia’s aggression. Russia’s aggression extends well beyond Ukraine. We have recently seen the airspace of our EU partners violated by drones and planes. The Government has strongly condemned these activities. Through its sustained pursuit of hybrid campaigns, Russia is a major threat to stability, democracy and social cohesion throughout Europe and beyond. These activities represent an attempt to divide member states, in particular in relation to support for Ukraine. Like other member states, Ireland is susceptible to these malicious acts, which include disruption to critical infrastructure, cyberattacks, spreading disinformation and attempts to interfere in electoral processes.",
                "The Government takes the risks posed by these activities very seriously and we are responding. We are actively and constructively engaging in the development of EU policies aimed at combating hybrid threats, particularly Russia’s campaign of hybrid activity against the EU and its member states. We support the full use of all means available to prevent, deter and respond to Russia’s hybrid activities, including through sanctions. We will continue to work with our EU partners to strengthen our collective resilience. Domestically, the Government is implementing a range of relevant measures at national level to combat hybrid threats from state and non-state actors, including Russia, its proxies and aligned actors. This includes a substantial increase in investment in the National Cyber Security Centre, publication of a national counter-disinformation strategy, legislation enhancing election security through the Electoral Commission, the commencement of legislation on third country investment screening and control of exports.",
                "The Department of Defence will publish Ireland’s first national maritime security strategy by the end of this year. We are also building up Ireland’s national capability to identify, mitigate and counter hybrid threats through our membership of the European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats in Helsinki.",
                "Internal repression in Russia has increased even further since Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Mr. Putin’s regime systematically represses opposition politicians, civil society organisations, independent media and other critical voices with the use of repressive legislation and politically motivated prison sentences. That is why, when he observes the rigours of debate and forceful civic engagement in the EU and democracies around the world, he concludes that we are divided and democracy is weak. When he invaded Ukraine, he thought Europe and its transatlantic partners would abandon Ukraine. He miscalculated and he is seeing it backfire. The EU and our international partners are united in our resolve to end this war and the threat it poses to our collective security.",
                "In September 2024, then Taoiseach, Deputy Simon Harris and President Zelenskyy signed a comprehensive bilateral agreement on support and co-operation between Ireland and Ukraine. This agreement sends a clear signal to Russia that we will not waver in the face of the ongoing brutal aggression in Ukraine and signifies Ireland’s determination to stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes. The Government’s focus remains on achieving a just and lasting peace in Ukraine, a peace that respects Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the principles of the UN Charter and international law.",

                "I appreciate the opportunity to participate in this important debate as we approach the fourth year of Russia’s full-scale illegal war of aggression against its peaceful neighbour, Ukraine. It is essential that we never lose sight of the fact that Russia, in a fundamental violation of the UN Charter and international law, launched an unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine, a European country and fellow United Nations member state. Each day Russia continues its brutal war against Ukraine and its occupation of Ukrainian territory is another day that Russia violates international law and makes the world, in particular Europe, a less secure, more dangerous place. How Europe and the international community respond will have far-reaching consequences for Ukraine, European security and the future of the rules-based international order.",
                "Russia has continued its full-scale aggression without pause since 24 February 2022. Since then, indescribable suffering has been inflicted upon the people of Ukraine. Millions have been forced to flee their homeland and millions more are internally displaced. Hundreds of thousands have been killed with thousands more, including children, forcibly removed, tortured or arbitrarily imprisoned by Russian forces. Villages, towns and even entire cities have been completely destroyed in the fighting that continues unabated. Ukraine and the Ukrainian people are valiantly withstanding a massive recurring Russian onslaught. Nightly drone and missile strikes have intensified. These aerial bombardments are indiscriminate and do not distinguish between military targets and civilian infrastructure. Their sole objective is to impose terror, inflict suffering and break the spirit of the Ukrainian people.",
                "Yet Ukraine and its people fight on, exercising their right under the UN Charter to defend themselves. Each day they continue their heroic efforts to defend their country and the fundamental freedoms that we in Ireland and across Europe hold dear, particularly the right of all people to live peacefully within their own borders without fear of being invaded. I witnessed the outstanding courage, resolve and determination of Ukrainians first-hand when I visited Kyiv in 2022 and 2023. I pay tribute again to the people of Ukraine for their bravery. I have paid this tribute directly to President Zelenskyy and in my latest phone call with him in September, I expressed my, and the Irish people’s, solidarity with the people of Ukraine. I invited President Zelenskyy to visit Ireland to witness first-hand this solidarity and I look forward to welcoming him in the near future.",
                "Almost four years on from Russia’s full-scale invasion, tragically, it seems that we are no closer to peace. Russia is counting on us to grow tired and become distracted by competing priorities but it will be disappointed.",
                "Alongside our European Union partners, Ireland’s support for the people and government of Ukraine is steadfast. Providing this continued support for Ukraine is not only the right thing to do but it is in our fundamental national interest. What happens in Ukraine today will shape the world we live in tomorrow. That is why Ireland’s support for Ukraine remains as strong today as it was on day one of Russia’s invasion. We will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes.",
                "The European Union has been steadfast in its solidarity with Ukraine since the first day of this terrible war. We are working with our partners in the EU to provide real and tangible assistance to Ukraine and to respond substantially to Russia’s illegal invasion. This commitment was a major focus of October’s European Council meeting, where European leaders were briefed by President Zelenskyy on recent developments in Ukraine, including Russia’s escalation of strikes on civilians and civilian infrastructure. In response, my fellow leaders and I reconfirmed the EU’s unwavering support for Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders. The EU is providing, in co-ordination with like-minded partners and allies, comprehensive political, financial, economic, humanitarian, military and diplomatic support to Ukraine and its people.",
                "The EU is also working to show Russia that there is no positive outcome to the war. Through unprecedented EU sanctions, we are having an impact. Russia is finding it harder to access battlefield equipment and to generate revenue to pay for its illegal war. Russia must be held accountable for its actions and should have to pay for the destruction it has caused. There must be an economic cost to such flagrant violations of international law. This cost must also act as a deterrent against Russia or any other country contemplating any future violation of the UN Charter and international law. We therefore support the European Union’s initiative for a reparations loan to Ukraine using immobilised Russian assets.",
                "We all want this war to end but it must end on the basis of a comprehensive, just and lasting peace, one that respects Ukraine’s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity and the principles of the UN Charter and international law. It is also vital that Ukraine’s security is protected in the long term. That means strong, credible guarantees that ensure Ukraine can defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity to avoid a repetition of the past. Despite sustained US and European diplomatic efforts towards peace and Ukraine’s readiness to pursue it, Russia is intent on escalating the war.",
                "The obvious reality is that President Putin continues each day to choose violence and destruction over peace, disregarding alternatives to its chosen path of needless invasion, war and further bloodshed. Time and again, the international community has offered Putin the chance to stop the killing, agree to a ceasefire and pursue peace and time and time again, he has refused. Actions speak louder than words. It is for Russia now to show through its actions a willingness to achieve peace by halting its brutal attacks and agreeing to a full and unconditional ceasefire. It can do so at any time. Now is the time to increase the pressure on Russia and to redouble efforts to secure a ceasefire.",
                "As winter comes upon us, Russia is relentlessly targeting Ukraine’s energy facilities with drone and missile attacks, directly killing people in the process and imperilling the safety and security of all Ukrainians. Access to the most basic needs, including water, shelter and protection services, continues to be extremely challenging for many. If we, Ukraine’s allies and friends, do not step up and support its efforts to safeguard its critical infrastructure, more people will be displaced. Millions could be forced to leave their homes simply to stay alive. The humanitarian and regional consequences will be immense. In this context, it is more important than ever that we bolster support for Ukraine in every way we can.",
                "Since 2022, Ireland has provided more than €273 million in bilateral assistance to Ukraine. This includes €173 million in humanitarian and stabilisation assistance and an additional €100 million in non-lethal military support for Ukraine, which was announced last March. Among the projects that Ireland is currently supporting are the construction of underground clinics to safely provide services at two Kharkiv maternity hospitals, the building of civic protection shelters and the provision of school meals to children in front-line districts. We are also providing financial support to carry out critical repair work to Ukraine’s war-damaged energy infrastructure. Our support for Ukraine will continue when this war ends and Ukraine can begin its recovery and reconstruction.",
                "Russia’s full-scale invasion triggered the largest displacement crisis in Europe in decades, with millions displaced and in need of continued, life-saving support. Since February 2022, Ireland has granted temporary protection to over 120,000 Ukrainians forced to leave their homeland and seek sanctuary here, one of the highest per capita rates in Europe. We have invested significantly in providing a safe haven for Ukrainian refugees. Some sought refuge for a while before returning home. Some moved on to other countries. Some remain and are making an invaluable contribution, enriching our society and culture.",
                "Many have been taken into homes and communities across the State, and I want to take a moment to thank the people of Ireland for their generosity in offering safe haven to so many Ukrainians. To the Ukrainians who are here, this is your home for as long you need it. I have no doubt that, in time, you will play a crucial role in rebuilding your country when it is once again safe to do so.",
                "Russia’s war of aggression continues to have far-reaching consequences beyond the borders of Ukraine. It has compounded an already fragile global food security situation, with major implications for food and agricultural commodity prices. Russia continues to weaponise hunger by targeting Ukraine’s grain and critical infrastructure. This not only inflicts suffering on Ukrainian people, but also has a disproportionate impact on those most vulnerable to food insecurity around the world. Despite these significant challenges, the Ukrainian people have demonstrated their commitment to maintaining Ukraine as one of the world's top agricultural producers. Ukraine’s efforts to remain a top grain exporter help to defend us from global hunger.",
                "When I visited Kyiv in July 2022, I had the honour of laying flowers at the memorial to the Holodomor, Ukraine’s catastrophic famine, which took place in the 1930s. Ireland recognises that the resulting trauma of that famine remains and is deeply felt by the Ukrainian people, shaping a profound empathy for those who suffer from hunger today. As a champion of global efforts to reduce hunger and starvation, rooted in our own historical experience of famine, Ireland will continue to work with Ukraine and our EU and international partners to meet the needs of people and communities affected by food insecurity. I am pleased to announce that Ireland will provide €2 million to the food from Ukraine programme, which will be launched at a food security summit in Kyiv tomorrow, and which will contribute to tackling global hunger and improving child nutrition.",
                "We have read and heard horrific reports of gross and systematic violations of human rights by Russia. One of Russia’s most brutal and egregious crimes has been the forcible transfer of Ukrainian children from their homes. Ireland is a member of the International Coalition for the Return of Ukrainian Children. In September, I participated in a meeting of the coalition at the UN General Assembly, where I expressed Ireland’s support for the efforts to ensure the safe return of Ukrainian children. Any peaceful resolution to Russia’s war must involve the return of all forcibly transferred people, including children. This is an appalling act and such actions amount to war crimes. We must work to hold those responsible to account.",
                "Ireland supports the continued investigations of the International Criminal Court in Ukraine and welcomes the historic progress made towards establishing the special tribunal for the crime of aggression against Ukraine. We are actively engaging with our partners in the Council of Europe to ensure that the special tribunal can be operational as quickly as possible.",
                "This war and the threat posed by Russia are not only an existential threat to Ukraine, but a major challenge to the security we value so greatly. It is more important than ever that Europe and the United States continue to work together to achieve a just and lasting peace for Ukraine. A just and lasting peace must bring stability and security. It must respect international law, including the principles of independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity and that international borders must not be changed by force.",
                "Ireland has always insisted that an end to the war must be obtained through diplomatic means, with the full participation of Ukraine in any peace talks. We welcome the efforts of all partners, including US President Donald Trump, towards that goal.",
                "As Russia continues to refuse to come to the table, the world must increase economic and political pressure on it until it does. Those of us who have joined the coalition of the willing in support of Ukraine will stand with Ukraine, shoulder-to-shoulder, for as long as it takes. With our European and international partners, we will strengthen and tighten our sanctions and work to cut off Russia's energy revenues, the lifeblood of its war machine. We will also work to increase our support to Ukraine to strengthen its defences and protect Ukraine's critical infrastructure. We will put in place the security guarantees that Ukraine needs to underpin any future peace agreement. Ireland believes that, ultimately, the greatest security guarantee that we can offer to Ukraine is membership of the European Union, the most successful peace project in the history of this Continent. I have been a strong early supporter of Ukraine's pathway to membership of the European Union. As a Government, we strongly support Ukraine's application for EU membership and are determined to advance it under our Presidency of the European Union next year.",
                "The world has been humbled by the strength and resilience of the people of Ukraine. While the current challenges may seem insurmountable, we must not falter in our resolve. We recognise that our continued support for Ukraine is a necessity, not a choice. That is why Ireland stands with Ukraine now and in the future. Go raibh míle maith agaibh agus slava Ukraini."

Let there be no equivocation: there is one single aggressor and one sole reason for this brutal conflict, which is the madness of the dictatorship of Vladimir Putin that is driving this war. It is a war that is having an extremely material impact on every home, every household and every family that we represent in Dáil Éireann, in Ireland, but equally in so many homes, households and livelihoods across Europe and, most perversely, in the poorest countries of the world, which rely on the energy and food that would ordinarily come from Ukraine, but of course we see energy and food being used as weapons of war by the Russian war machine.",
                "Let it not be lost on us that we are also seeing increasing activities of hybrid warfare emanating from Russia, as alluded to by the Minister of State, which is having a direct impact. That can be drones flying over European territory, criminal hacking of European systems or the sheer amount of disinformation being added to our political discourse here in Ireland and across the European Union. The Taoiseach and I both find ourselves on Russian sanctions lists, a deliberate act of provocation by the Russian embassy, located, sadly, in my constituency. That is why it is imperative that this brutal war be ended as soon as possible on terms that are true to what Ukraine stands for, in protecting its sovereign territory and independence, recognising the importance of the UN Charter and making sure that it dissuades those who see Russia's actions as being viable options for their own nationalistic goals or indeed encouraging Russia. If it is allowed to run amok continuously across Ukraine, where is next?",
                "We must note that there has been tangible, real Irish support to the people of Ukraine, as alluded to by both the Taoiseach and Minister of State. People have opened their homes and communities to more than 118,000 Ukrainians since this outbreak of this iteration of the war. There has been very real humanitarian support and real, clear support from this Government for non-lethal efforts. I question anyone who says that the provision of training to de-mine Ukraine to stop women and children from being blown up in Ukraine by Russian mines. I question anyone who says that those are things that we should not be supporting. There is a peaceful future for the people of Ukraine and it must be a future that we in Ireland support through our absolute support, as the Taoiseach alluded to, for making sure that Ukraine has a speedy accession to the European Union."

Geall le ceithre bliana ó shin, rinne Vladimir Putin agus an Rúis ionsaí uafásach ar an Úcráin, agus is é \"uafásach\" an focal ceart agus cuí le n-úsáid. Ina dhiaidh sin, lean an choimhlint agus cogadh is mó san Eoraip le 80 bliain anuas, agus go leor teifigh ag teacht as sin.

                "Nearly four years ago, Vladimir Putin's Russia launched a brutal war of aggression against its neighbour, Ukraine. \"Brutal\" is truly the word to use. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has resulted in the largest land conflict and greatest displacement of people on the European Continent in 80 years. I reiterate that Russia's attack on and bombardment of the Ukrainian people is an attack on sovereignty, peace and the right of a nation to be sovereign, independent and free. It is a vicious and violent expression of the dead-end belief that might is right and that military power can dominate humanity.",
                "I first want to touch on the issue of the huge number of civilian casualties in this conflict, which remains considerably high and perhaps does not get the attention that it ought to. I reference the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, which highlights that civilian casualties in October 2025 remain high, with at least 148 killed and 929 injured, similar to the numbers in September and August. Most deaths and injuries, at about 65%, occurred near the front line. As in the previous month, the vast majority of civilian casualties, 97%, occurred in areas under the control of the government of Ukraine. October saw emergency power cuts across multiple regions of Ukraine, driven by the Russian Federation’s continued region-specific attacks and renewed large-scale strikes on energy and infrastructure. A considerable part of its strategy has been attacking civilian infrastructure, including energy and water, and the obvious impact that has on the quality of life, living conditions and humanitarian situation of the people of Ukraine.",
                "Total civilian casualties from January to October 2025 are 27% higher than during the same period last year and the number of casualties for the first ten months of 2025 has already exceeded the total for all of 2024. These are shocking figures. It is extremely concerning and it points to an escalation of the situation of the sheer scale of civilian harm we are seeing in Ukraine. Unfortunately, the situation is only getting worse. We must remember that behind all those figures are real men, women and children whose lives have been shattered, destroyed and turned upside-down. Tá pobal iomlán tar éis dul tríd rudaí uafásacha. Tá go leor daoine tar éis baill teaghlaigh a chailliúint, idir deartháireacha, iníonacha, uncailí, cairde, pé rud é. Is dócha go mbeidh an fhulaingt sin ann fós i ndiaidh deireadh an chogaidh, pé uair a tharlaíonn sé.",
                "I am reminded of the horrific scenes we watched on our television screens in February 2022 when this brutal war began. I remember the gut-wrenching feeling as we watched, appalled, as families, women and children, walked through the cold for hours, climbed on and off packed trains and trucks, forced to flee for their lives, uncertain what their future held. The people of Ireland showed great solidarity and their hearts went out to everyone affected.",
                "Since then, as we know, millions of Ukrainian people have been forced to leave their homeland. I acknowledge the people in Ireland who have done what they can to support the Ukrainian people who arrived here. In spite of this and the situation that is faced by the people of Ukraine, ordinary civilians in Ukraine have persevered, shown immense courage and resilience, continued their everyday lives and kept their country going despite the severe challenges and brutality that they have faced.",
                "They are faced with incredible challenges and attacks that greatly impact their ability to do the basic things, such as provide education, healthcare, heating and water distribution, and just get on with day-to-day living.",
                "There is no doubt that the Russian Federation and Vladimir Putin himself significantly underestimated Ukraine and the resolve of its people, which has been clearly demonstrated since the war broke out in February 2022. Since then, the attacks have only become fiercer and more cynical. Ukraine's energy infrastructure has come under severe attack. There have been numerous large-scale, co-ordinated attacks over the course of this conflict, which has created a serious electricity deficit and difficulties for ordinary people. There is a particular danger in relation to attacks on the nuclear facilities at Zaporizhzhia and Chernobyl. There is no question that what we have seen in locations such as Bucha, Mariupol and elsewhere has been barbarism on the part of the Russian Federation. There have been completely unacceptable and despicable attacks on the Ukrainian people.",
                "Russia's war also extends beyond the destruction of civilian and critical infrastructure and murder. It affects the lives of countless Ukrainian families through the reported forcible deportation of children. I pay tribute to the work done by the Ukrainian ambassador in recent years in articulating, with great force, passion and clarity, the situation of Ukrainian people at home and in Ireland. At the foreign affairs committee recently, she outlined the horrific situation of the forcible abduction of children. Thousands of children have been illegally transferred and, in some instances, adopted or conscripted into the Russian military from Ukraine. On that occasion, the ambassador told the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade:",
                "Their identities are falsified, their ties to Ukraine severed and their futures put in jeopardy. These actions amount to a systematic and unprecedented genocide, targeting the very future of the Ukrainian people. Russia attacks the very essence of childhood itself to erase Ukrainian identity. The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Vladimir Putin and Maria Lvova-Belova, a landmark move underscoring the moral and legal gravity of these crimes. … Those who have adopted and hidden Ukrainian children under false pretences must also be held accountable.",
                "We have heard that the confirmed number is over 20,000 but the real figure could be multiples of this for children who were abducted and forcibly displaced to Russia. It is heartbreaking to hear the reports of parents who have lost their children, who were taken under the pretext of summer camps in the occupied territories and moved deeper into regions of Russia where their parents cannot find them. I am not sure this gets the attention that it ought to in this country. It is a crime that is difficult to comprehend. It simply does not bear thinking about.",
                "The Irish people have been clear on whose side they stand. For 45 months, the courageous people of Ukraine have stood against the Russian onslaught and the brutal invasion. We hope peace may be delivered, although when and on what terms we do not know. On that day, there will be a need to support the Ukrainian people in rebuilding their country. Unfortunately, it is clear that Russia is not interested in peace at this moment in time. The Irish people have supported the Ukrainian people in the wake of this invasion. I reiterate Sinn Féin's solidarity with the people of Ukraine.",
                "Táimid soiléir gur sáraíodh an dlí idirnáisiúnta ar an gceist seo. We are clear that Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a blatant breach of international law. It is full-scale aggression that has been defined by the potential war crimes committed by the Russian military against innocent people. We call for a co-ordinated and concerted effort by the international community to secure an end to the hostilities and bring about peace. However, that peace needs to be on the basis of a just settlement for the people of Ukraine that respects Ukraine's rights. Ireland must use its voice to the greatest extent possible to achieve and support such an end.",
                "Ireland remains a militarily neutral country but that does not mean we are politically neutral. We are clear that this is a war of aggression and that the Russian Federation is the aggressor. It is clear that, at this time, the Russian Federation is paying mere lip service, if even that, to peace negotiations. In my view, it is incumbent on the international community to leverage greater pressure on Russia to come to the negotiating table and deliver a potential peace, but a peace that respects the rights of the people of Ukraine.",
                "To conclude, it has been nearly four years since the commencement of the brutal war in Ukraine. When we have had statements to mark the anniversary of the war, we have all hoped not to have to mark another year. Unfortunately, that is the case, and the people of Ukraine have been let down in that regard. We must do whatever we can at the Irish level to use our voice internationally for peace and to show solidarity with Ukraine. We must ensure that if peace comes, it respects the rights of the people of Ukraine and their territorial integrity."

The incursion of Russian drones into Poland’s airspace is completely unacceptable, reckless and provocative. It is a further example of a Russian Government that is intent on provocation and destabilisation in the region. It is a breach of international law and must be taken with the utmost seriousness.

The world must put the same effort into making peace as has gone into making war. Ukraine, Russia, the United States, the EU and the UN must play a role in bringing this conflict to an end. This will require putting the interests of the people of the region above other geopolitical interests, including the profit-motivated interests of the armaments industries. These negotiations must include Ukraine. There can be nothing agreed without the consent of Kyiv. Ireland must use its position as a neutral state to aid these efforts.",

It is time to reiterate our call for a sustainable, permanent and just outcome to the war through a negotiated peace settlement.",

Siegfried Sassoon’s “Base Details” paints the picture: those who make the decisions about war do so from the safety of bunkers, far removed from the front line. Sadly, this applies to war in Ukraine as much as it did during the First World War, when the poem was written. As we look around the world, we see the terrible cost to civilians during wars, particularly women and children. In the genocide in Gaza, the war in Sudan and the war here in Europe, it is civilians who carry the burden of casualties, as well as the decision to try to flee the warzones.",

We must lead the demands for negotiations, and Ireland must be prepared to use its influence to facilitate those negotiations. Our own history shows that conflict, no matter how intractable it appears, can only be resolved through talks and negotiations. In fact, our peace process proves it is only through talks that the seeds of peace can be sown. Current conflicts in Ukraine and Sudan, and the ongoing genocide in Gaza, are heartbreaking. These conflicts must be brought to a just resolution. Sadly, bullets and bombs make huge profits for the warmongers.

                "Like many of us, I remember when we woke one morning in February 2022 to learn Russia had invaded Ukraine. In the first week, everyone wondered what would happen and believed the Russians would roll over the Ukrainians very quickly. What has happened has proved otherwise, and it is certainly a tribute to the resilience and courage of the Ukrainian people that they have held up for so long against what would always have been considered a huge global military power and that they have been able to fight back and hold the line. Of course, they have done that with the support of many, none more than the people of Ireland, who welcomed thousands of them here. In the first few weeks, many of us worked with people we knew or got to know from Ukraine to help to bring families here, accommodate them and work with them. Many of those people have become part of communities in different parts of the country and have been a huge asset. Many I have got to know have told horrific stories of things that happened to their families back home. One man I know from my community told me his sister was killed in the very early days of the war. Since then, three members of his extended family have died. All were civilians. In conflicts like this, the people who suffer most are usually civilians, and that has been very much the case as a consequence of the brutal aggression of Russia against its neighbour. Of course, Vladimir Putin is basically a fascist dictator trying to expand his power and grow his influence. It is clear that he has to be stood up to.",

We have had talks and new dawns promised, including at the Alaska talks, and peace was supposed to be coming but it has not come. It has not because ultimately Putin does not want peace; Putin wants to continue the war. Unless an aggressor accepts that they have to stop, retreat and go back to the negotiating table, a war will continue. That has been the tragedy for hundreds of thousands of people in Ukraine.",
                "I have often thought that if the hundreds of billions spent, through the war industry, on the Ukraine war alone were spent on health services or anything positive for humanity, it would make such a difference. Instead, we have genocide in Gaza and genocide in Sudan, which is going to continue. Such conflicts are feeding an industry that is making huge profits from them. That link is not pointed out often enough. We need to be firm on this and recognise that vested interests do not want war to stop, very often with tragic consequences for so many.",
                "The Irish people have played their role. Very many families opened their hearts and homes to people from Ukraine and were enriched by that experience and by having Ukrainians in their communities. That welcome must continue. Sometimes I hear a backlash in some of our communities and all sorts of negative comments about people who come here from Ukraine or other countries. We must be very conscious that only this week a man was convicted in the courts of the murder of someone simply because he thought that person did not speak English. That tells us we have a huge problem boiling under the surface in this country. We have to address the problems of racism, Islamophobia and other prejudices. We cannot avoid that reality. While we welcome and want to accommodate people fleeing conflict and situations in which they would have their human rights denied, we recognise that, while they enrich our country, there are those with a very negative agenda. That has to be fought against.",
                "The Irish people stand wholeheartedly with the people of Ukraine against the aggression of Russia. We want to see peace come about. We all know that peace can come about only if the aggressor accepts that peace should prevail. It is certainly the view of most people that until Vladimir Putin feels strong economic pressure, he will not relent. That pressure must come from all countries, not only those in Europe. They must stop buying Russian oil and exert maximum sanctions to ensure Russia is brought to heel and to the negotiating table to work out a settlement that will give Ukraine back its territory and ensure a full and final peace settlement. There cannot be a settlement if Ukrainian representatives are outside the door. It is vital that they be part of it.",

He went as far as to say that giving more aid to Ukraine is a bit like trying to help an alcoholic by sending them another crate of vodka. This is the Head of Government of a state within the EU. It is disgraceful and deeply offensive. Our Government, including our new Minister for foreign affairs, must do everything in her power to push back against the Hungarian Government and ensure the Ukrainian people can continue to rely on Europe as a whole. If the past weekend has shown us anything, it is that the Irish certainly know how to put pressure on the Hungarians.",
                "The truth of the matter is that things are not getting better in or for Ukraine. The Russian military’s rapid advance in the Zaporizhzhia region, where it has reportedly taken two more villages, is of great concern. Russia’s attacks on the energy grid continue to ramp up as it attempts to squeeze the country during the winter. The statistics on this are very worrying. Sixty four percent of Ukraine’s 25 GW generating capacity has been either destroyed or occupied since 2024. Ukraine has lost 80% of its thermal capacity since 2024. As of autumn of this year, its energy infrastructure has been operating at only about one third of its pre-invasion generation capacity. As of October 2025, Russia has destroyed 60% of Ukraine’s gas production capacity. This points to an area of aid that Ireland can provide. It can provide tools to help to rebuild the grid and emergency generators. The Irish Government needs to continue to offer support in this regard. We are blessed by our geographic location, which in modern times has left us far away from bad actors such as Russia, which wishes to do us and our allies harm, but we should never take our location for granted, nor should we use our geography to wash our hands of our responsibility to stand in solidarity with our allied nations.",
                "Occupation is something this island knows well. However, the scale of violence due to Russia’s illegal war is something beyond even our knowledge of occupation. Ukraine has had 400,000 members of its military killed or injured, with a further 35,000 missing as of January 2025. Over 14,000 Ukrainian civilians have also been killed. This is a nation and people scarred who are now also spread out all across the world. Over 9.5 million Ukrainians have been displaced by this war, which is 22% of the country’s population.",
                "Imagine for a second that was you and your family who had to flee from your home. No matter how welcoming the host country and family were, it is not where you would truly want to be. Now imagine that political parties in the country to which you fled are deciding to use you for political point scoring. In an Independent Ireland statement last night, Deputy O’Flynn stated, \"We cannot go on handing out medical cards to anyone who happens to arrive here bearing a Ukrainian passport\". That is the view of Deputy O’Flynn and Independent Ireland. They should be ashamed of themselves. We all know the pitch at which Independent Ireland’s whistle is being set with its Ireland-first policy. It is the party of statements and blusters. We in the Labour Party will not throw Ukrainian people under the bus for a headline. Indeed, our housing spokesperson, Deputy Conor Sheehan, rightly called out the Government this month for the huge lack of clarity it gave the Ukrainian people living in Ireland over its commitment to change entitlements. Without a real plan, the Government risks causing mass homelessness for people who we have rightly supported to this point and still claim to support. The Government should show us it supports them, rather than simply telling us it does.",
                "The attack yesterday on a Polish railway that was key for delivering supplies into Ukraine should be a stark reminder that Russia is a dangerous aggressor to all of Europe. Indeed, a Romanian village has also had to be evacuated yesterday due to a Russian attack near its border. I worry when I see certain politicians try to downplay what Russia is and what it is doing. It is using a hybrid war across the Continent, make no mistake about that. We simply cannot keep our heads in the sand about this. Hybrid warfare is being waged on continental Europe, of which Ireland has been a victim through the HSE attack. We also see worrying activity in our waters and the vulnerability of our undersea cables.",
                "I welcome the increased investment in the national cybersecurity centre in this budget. As our party’s spokesperson on defence, I have met experts and, to be frank, I am greatly concerned with the reactive state of our cybersecurity. The HSE cyberattack, which was instigated by a Russian group, is a warning sign for just how vulnerable we are. With speed and overdue urgency, we need to move to a more proactive space on cyber.",
                "From reports, it seems that President Zelenskyy will be travelling to Ireland in December. What will this Government tell him when he lands? Will it be news that it plans to provide greater support to the people of Ukraine or that the amount of time Ukrainian refugees are housed in State accommodation is to be examined and potentially reduced from 90 to 30 days? I fear we, like others in Europe, are slipping into a place of complacency and acceptance that a Russian victory is inevitable. It is not just here but around Europe governments are talking about cuts to refugees from this war. Statements from Prime Minister Tusk this week fuel those fears. The Prime Minister’s statement that, “Enthusiasm for supporting Ukraine has weakened in Poland and abroad. People are tired of the war and its costs, so maintaining support is harder”, is not helpful to the morale of the Ukrainian people. They cannot be allowed to feel abandoned. Indeed, they cannot be abandoned. This is not a war they wanted or sought. Rather, it is a war that was thrust upon them by an illegal invasion. No one is more tired of this war and its costs than the people of Ukraine. We cannot let apathy take hold. We cannot let the Ukrainian people become a political football and we cannot stop our support for a free, sovereign and democratic Ukraine. Like with Palestine, the history books will remember not just those who stood on the right side of history with this conflict but those who supported the Ukrainian people.",
                "I am proud of what we have done so far as a nation. The effort of the Irish people to support the Ukrainian people who have arrived and settled here has been immense. They are our friends and neighbours and an important part of so many communities. Let us continue our support for the people of Ukraine so when President Zelenskyy arrives in Ireland, we can look him in the eye and tell him Ireland does now and will always support a free and democratic Ukraine."

                "Notwithstanding other matters that may have happened today, I believe this is the most important debate to be happening in this House. It is not just about Russia’s illegal invasion of Ukraine but, rather, a question around the war in Europe and, indeed, a war on Europe by an increasingly aggressive Russia. I have to express my disappointment that while every other parliament in Europe has been debating and exploring this issue, this is the first time since the summer we have had the opportunity to have statements on this matter, even though I have requested it every week since we came back after the summer. It also reflects a lack of media coverage of the ongoing war in Ukraine. With some notable exceptions, we do not get the level of attention paid to what is happening. In many other countries in Europe, there is an exploration of what this means for those countries and Europe more widely. I criticise The Irish Times in particular, which decided to publish an opinion piece this week in which other European countries were criticised for deciding to invest in defence but yet not once in that opinion piece was the reason mentioned, that is, their fear of the threat coming from Russia.",
                "I welcome the fact that President Zelenskyy is likely to come to Ireland in December. I called previously for him to be invited to address the joint Houses in person, as he previously did online. It would be welcome both to show our solidarity in these Houses and also to recognise the enormous contribution of those Ukrainians who came here, both before and after the war, and how they are contributing to all of our communities.",
                "Next year, Ireland will hold the Presidency of the European Council of the European Union. It is at a critical period. We have always had a very proud record in support of enlargement. We need to use that period of our Presidency to do what we can to further Ukraine’s future membership of the European Union. In the same way in 1990, when Charles Haughey was Taoiseach, we held the Presidency and we supported a unified Germany becoming a member of the EU. In 2004, when Bertie Ahern was Taoiseach during that EU Presidency, we supported the largest ever accession when ten countries, including eight from central and eastern Europe, joined the EU. We should do whatever we can to support the accession of Ukraine and, indeed, other countries at that time.",
                "I commend those members of the European Parliament - I note Barry Andrews, for instance, is currently in Ukraine - who have continued to ensure at a European level that all European countries, including Ireland, continue to show solidarity with Ukraine. Indeed, questions should be asked of some of our MEPs who have failed to show that solidarity over the last number of years.",
                "We know about the horrors of the impact of the war in Ukraine. Yet, as I said, they are not sufficiently debated in this House. It is horrific that there are now an estimated 20,000 Ukrainian children who have been forcibly transferred to areas under Russian control by the Russian defence forces. Think about that number - 20,000 children - and the impact that has on their families and, more importantly, the long-term trauma of those children. We know that Putin has no regard for the rights of those children. Yet, why is it that we are not doing enough to ensure that they are reunited with their families?",
                "I wish to touch on a number of questions that we as a country need to address in our own context with regard to security and defence. I will start by referencing the Russian shadow fleet. RTÉ has previously reported that, based on intelligence, 245 shadow fleet vessels have passed through Irish waters more than 450 times in the first seven months of this year. A total of 72 of those vessels were named by intelligence as already being on sanctions lists and many of those were part of the Russian shadow fleet.",
                "I find it bizarre that we are not calling this out in this House the whole time. We can be absolutely certain that if an American vessel was in Irish waters without permission, people in this House would rightly be criticising it and screaming and shouting. If an Israeli vessel was unlawfully in Irish waters, we would be having debates nearly every week about the issue. The Russian shadow fleet, though, is passing through without debate in this House and, quite frankly, without sufficient action being taken. I welcome the fact that Canada, which is at the other side of the exclusive economic zone and shares responsibility for much of the Atlantic, is now stepping up pressure against the Russian shadow fleet. In terms of our responsibility, particularly if we really are a neutral country, then we do need to take action, not only because this shadow fleet is engaged in sanction-busting but because many of these vessels are, for want of a better description, rust buckets. If any of them are in any way damaged or are transferring oil in the Atlantic or other parts of the world, there is a huge environmental risk and this will impact Irish waters. Yet, we have never had a debate about the Russian shadow fleet operating within our waters.",
                "When we look at cyber infrastructure, again, people here know only too well about the HSE attack, which Deputy Duncan Smith referred to. Ultimately, it will have cost the State in excess of €500 million, but more importantly, lives were lost as a result of it. We are seeing increasing numbers of cyberattacks by Russia on Ireland and on other European states. This is because Russia does not respect Ireland's neutrality when it comes to cyberspace. It is determined to do anything to undermine states that believe in democracy, human rights and the rule of law. We can see this too if we look at the attempts by Russia to influence Romania and Moldova in their elections. I have no doubt that we will see Russian bots trying to influence elections here in Ireland in the future and we need to be prepared for that.",
                "I make no apologies for saying we need to stand in solidarity with our European partners and neighbours, in the same way they showed great solidarity with us when we faced the threats of Brexit. If we look at what has happened to our fellow European states, the Estonians, the Lithuanians and the Latvians can tell us plenty in terms of the cyberattacks over the last number of years, but it is not just about what has happened in recent years. Let us look at even just the last few months. In September alone, Members will be aware that 19 unarmed Russian drones landed in Poland. That was no accident. In Denmark, when European leaders, including the Taoiseach, were gathering, drone attacks led to the closure of the airports around Copenhagen. At the same time, three Russian MiG-31 jets violated Estonian airspace. We know, therefore, that Russia is showing increased aggression, not just to Ukraine but to other European countries. Indeed, Boris Pistorius, the German defence minister, who is an SPD politician, a social democrat, has warned that he is now expecting increasing Russian escalation and has said that this past summer may have been the last summer Europe is at peace.",
                "We should not, therefore, underestimate the threat being posed to Europe. This is no longer a conflict purely about Ukraine. This is about a war on Europe by an increasingly hostile Russian regime. I am someone who deeply believes in multilateralism and I am strongly committed to the UN Charter. Yet, there are those who believe that in this country we should not be preparing to deal with the potential threat of increased Russian aggression, and who believe that Russia will have no interest, somehow, in Ireland. I say we should be listening to our friends in the Baltics and in central and eastern Europe because they know from their experience exactly what is going on. Anybody in this House who expects Vladimir Putin to respect the UN Charter is clearly deluded. There is absolutely no hope of Putin respecting it.",
                "It is really important that we continue to focus on providing whatever support we can - non-military support - to Ukraine. We need to continue to call out Russia at every international forum, whether it is for the cyberattacks, its brutal war against Ukraine, the abduction of children or the undermining of the UN Charter. This issue is incredibly important. I cannot figure out why, when we have Russian vessels operating in our waters, we are not debating this issue every week. Why are we not debating this issue when the key aspects of digital and energy infrastructure are under threat from Russian vessels and the shadow fleet operating in Irish waters? People say the Russians are not going to touch us. Well, they already are. Why do we think the Russian fleet and the shadow fleet are operating in Irish waters? Anybody in this House who has any doubts should talk to states like Finland and Sweden, states that share our perspective on the world, and they will tell them exactly about the threats we face. I believe that in this House and in many of the public debates, we have been naive and gullible about the threat being faced in Europe by Russia. We really need to finally face up to it.",
                "I welcome the fact we are having a debate today. This has to be the top priority for our new Minister for foreign affairs. I wish her well in that role. We should have no doubt that in our Presidency of the EU Council next year, this will be an even bigger issue. The threat will be even more significant. When it comes to cybersecurity and protecting our waters, we are going to have to face up to it. We need to continue to show our support for Ukraine, but equally, we need to make sure this country and the rest of Europe are prepared for what is happening. I hope the Minister of State will bring this topic to her colleagues in the Government. I have been disappointed so far in that I do not believe this matter has received sufficient attention either in this House or by the Government, but by God, we are going to need to address it.",
                "In the meantime, to the many people from Ukraine who have found their home here and found refuge, I continue to say \"slava Ukraini \". We will continue to support those people. You are welcome here. Thank you for your contribution. For however long it takes in your battle to uphold the principles of democracy, the rule of law and human rights, we will stand by you."

I start by expressing the Social Democrats' warm welcome for President Zelenskyy's upcoming visit and our absolute, unreserved condemnation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which is an imperial war that has caused massive loss of life. We talk about the war in Ukraine and Russia's attack and sometimes I think there has not been enough focus on the number of people killed in that war, and particularly military - the soldiers on either side. We do not know the exact figures, but from what we do know they are absolutely shocking.",
                "There are potentially 250,000 Russian soldiers dead with up to 1 million casualties, including wounded. In Ukraine, the figures are between 60,000 and 100,000 soldiers killed. That is at least 350,000 people, many of them soldiers, killed in that war. These are human beings whose lives have been wiped out by that war. Up to 1.5 million people are casualties of the Russian invasion, an illegal invasion, with many war crimes as part of that.",
                "When we talk about the war in Ukraine and European defence, we need to keep those numbers in mind. The question that comes to my mind is how many more tens or hundreds of thousands of people are going to be killed in the Russian invasion and the ongoing Russian-Ukrainian war? When we talk about building European defence and this move to war and war preparedness in Europe, we really need to question how many Europeans are going to get killed in the ongoing war and how many people are going to lose their lives.",
                "I reiterate our firm support for Ukraine's sovereignty and its territorial integrity. We call for and want to see further strengthening of economic sanctions on Russia. We believe the European Union and Ireland could be doing more to implement those sanctions. The use of military force is not the only way to challenge aggressors like Russia. The economic sanctions are also very important and the European Union and Ireland should be pushing harder on this by increasing the sanctions that are there.",
                "In this debate, I want to talk about our concerns around the undermining of Ireland's neutrality, the push to war that is happening at a European level, and that greater European involvement in war and defence being termed as increasing the European Union's security and defence. I am deeply concerned about the direction the European Union is going in. Of course we have to stop the Ukraine-Russia war and that Russian invasion but war is not the only way to do it. We have to find peaceful ways to resolve this war.",
                "I want to speak in short about and quote Ms Kaja Kallas, the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice President of the European Commission. Her comments deeply worried me when I saw them. This is from last week. Her role is to lead a more strategic and assertive foreign and security policy at EU level. She is responsible for strengthening Europe's security and defence. She points out that she is ensuring Europe stands with Ukraine and co-ordinating the work to build a European defence union. She said: \"Wars are lost by whoever runs out of money or soldiers first.\" I want to repeat that statement. She said: \"Wars are lost by whoever runs out of money or soldiers first.\" Wars are not just lost or ended by whoever runs out of money or soldiers. They are ended by interventions by states through the United Nations, different mechanisms, diplomatic measures and peace negotiations. I am deeply disturbed by that statement.",
                "What is the future for ending the Ukraine war? Is it constantly pumping in more money and soldiers with more deaths? How many deaths are we going to reach? Will it be 500,000 or 1 million people who will die in that war? Ireland needs to play a role of peacemaker and call out that the only way to end wars is not just by pumping money into weapons or killing more and more people, where whoever loses decides they have lost the most amount, but by diplomacy, intervention and a human rights framework that we have signed up to as a country and are part of. I again urge our Government to pursue paths of peace, diplomacy, pressure and economic sanctions rather than just this drive to a deeper pumping of billions into war and this war machine that is being built up.",
                "It is deeply disappointing that the European Union is suspending its fiscal rules and basically saying to countries that they should spend whatever they need to pump up defence spending. Yet when we see a housing crisis across the European Union and millions who are without a proper home, there is no such suspension of the fiscal rules to enable social spending for that. When we look at issues around the cost of living and basic services for disability around the European Union and when we look at poverty, there is no such relaxing of fiscal rules. I question why we are suspending fiscal rules for defence and pumping billions in and yet we are not doing that for people's basic standards of living. When we talk about the safety and security of our people, their welfare is the basic foundation block of building safety and security. I am deeply concerned that we are marching as part of a European drumbeat to a war. Ms Kallas said:",
                "Next week ... [she] will present ... with the [European] Commission, a plan to improve military mobility [in Europe] ... this will include proposals to make our roads, bridges, tunnels, train lines, airports and other infrastructure projects able to cope with large scale military movements ...",
                "We are preparing our European infrastructure for large scale military movements but we do not prepare for or invest in our European infrastructure to ensure our people have housing, healthcare, decent quality of services or even transport. It has to be worrying to see our European Commission talk about preparing our European infrastructure for large-scale military movements. Where are the large-scale military movements going to? What war are we going to be part of? What are we talking about here and where is Europe bringing us? It is absolutely a legitimate position to take that we are completely supportive of the European project, the European Union, cohesion, commonality and working together in a common infrastructure and institutions but also to hold a critical position on militarisation and, as I will argue when we look at the evidence, preparation for war in Europe and for an increased involvement of the European Union in that. We know throughout history that when the drums are banged for war and the talk is about war, a war inevitably happens. If we want to talk about peace and make peace happen, we need to invest in that as well.",
                "In my remaining time, I want to talk about neutrality, the importance of Irish neutrality and of us being a country that questions the drive to war and - to quote Catherine Connolly, who was elected President - the \"military-industrial complex\" at a European level. A lot of people threw that phrase around as if it was some kind of joke or something that was not serious. This is very serious. I have set it out there. Billions are going into military but what is going into social services? The reason President Catherine Connolly made those points was that we have seen in the US an imperial war machine being built up over time. A point Noam Chomsky has made over and over is that if you create a military industrial complex where the economy is built around investment weapons, you have to use those weapons. They have to be used somewhere. The investment in weapons creates a necessity for the creation of a war and for those weapons to be used because otherwise, why are you investing in them? Why are you creating them? Why are you putting billions in? We need to question this, question where we are going and what war is Europe and Ireland in particular going to be part of on an active basis. We need to protect our neutrality and, in particular, the triple lock.",
                "To finish, I want to talk about the issue of our welcome for the people of Ukraine and those fleeing the ongoing war.",
                "It was deeply disappointing to see the cut in support for the hosts of Ukrainian refugees - the accommodation recognition payment, ARP, funding. We need to correct the idea that Ukrainians are coming to Ireland to scam the system. When we look at what happened, we see that Ukrainians are coming to seek refuge from a war where up to 100,000 of their fellow citizens have been killed. Looking at those refugees coming here from Ukraine, the majority are women and children. Almost 30% of Ukrainian refugees are children. They are in schools across the country and have become part of our communities. People have welcomed them and massive work has been done in schools and communities to welcome the people of Ukraine and their children and to integrate their children. It does require resources and the Government has to a certain extent put those in, but it is not sufficient. We do see positive stories across the country of people welcoming refugees and doing that positive community and integration work. It is a another side to the anti-immigrant sentiment we are also seeing. There is a quiet majority in Ireland who are absolutely supportive of us being a welcoming country and giving care and support. Indeed, they are a very active group.",
                "However, our Government cut that payment and, unfortunately, it will worsen the housing crisis. Some have claimed that the payment is adding to the housing crisis. In fact, cutting it will add to the housing crisis. Where will the 35,000 Ukrainians who were hosted go if the funding to host is cut?",
                "Irish Red Cross research on hosts has shown that over half of hosts said the recognition payment was a key factor in them being able to continue their host placement. The research also showed the reason the majority of hosts were motivated to do so was due to solidarity with displaced Ukrainians. Significantly, 91% of the hosts had a positive experience, 83% of them said they had played a role in helping their guests to integrate, and 70% of the hosts said their guests had successfully integrated into the community. However, half of the hosts said they were struggling with financial costs and many of them also said the hosting they were doing was in their home or was not in a property that would be rented out, so hosting is not taking from the rental market. The Irish Red Cross has called on the Government not to cut the payment but to explore the expansion of the ARP to provide accommodation for other displaced groups because it provides accommodation that would not necessarily be available otherwise because it is people taking others into their homes on the basis of solidarity. I also think that the cut in the accommodation period will lead to Ukrainian people being made homeless, as a result of the Government's shift to be seen as hard on immigration. There has been a lot of discussion on this and we have called out the Government, including Simon Harris, Micheál Martin and others, for taking this anti-immigrant shift. It is not just playing into the far right; it is also playing into and feeding a rising racism by suggesting that, somehow, immigrants are to blame for the housing situation and other issues when they are absolutely not and it is the Government deflecting from its responsibility."

                "I am very grateful for the opportunity to speak about the very worrying spectre and instance of there being war in Europe for the first time in decades. It is important to take a moment to check and remind ourselves of the sheer significance and impact of that statement, that there is war on the Continent of Europe, a plane flight away from where we are at the moment. It becomes very real when you go to Brussels or speak to colleagues from countries that are in the eastern part of the European Union or border Russia and have in their lines of sight drones being flown into their airspace. There is a very real sense among our friends and partners in the European Union that there is a very live threat on the Continent of Europe. In Ireland, we cannot afford to put our heads in the sand and ignore the fact that threat exists.",
                "We have to be careful that we create a space to discuss the existence of this threat and that we do not instantly march or rush towards the fact that this is increasing militarisation or is instantly a threat to our neutrality. It is a recognition of the same threats and fears the people in Estonia, Sweden, Finland, Latvia and Lithuania feel about the potential aggression of the Russian Federation, in the same way we spoke to our European partners about standing in solidarity with us during the Brexit negotiations or the economic crisis. It is not unreasonable or ungenerous of them to request of us in this country or of our Government to stand in solidarity and listen to the fears of our partners about the threat they very much feel on their borders.",
                "While the war in Ukraine and the aggression by Russia are entirely illegal and undermine international law, in many ways they show that we need to stand for the sovereignty of the nation state, and not only for the sovereignty of the nation state but for the integrity of its borders and territory as well. If we fail to do that, then we very much fail to uphold the principle underpinning the European Union and the modern concept of the nation state, namely, that it has inviolable borders and that that is a principle worth recognition and acknowledgement in and of itself.",
                "That is why is it important, not only in recognising the immediate threat Russia poses to countries in the Baltics, for example, or in Scandinavia, that the European Union is also seen to take a stand on the need for the championing of democracy, the need for the integrity of borders, the need for the integrity of the nation state and ultimately, the respect of self-determination for people in respect of where they want to go and how they want to govern themselves, which has been violated by the invasion of Ukraine by Russia.",
                "We have led a very humanitarian response in this country. Over 100,000 people have come to our country seeking temporary protection as a result of the war. That is something I have seen in my own constituency. I pay tribute to all communities and households who have welcomed Ukrainian people into their families, communities and schools. Fundamentally, our schools very quickly pivoted, reacted and embraced the Ukrainian children who came into their schools and made them part of our society and community and integrated them fully. Great credit is due to all of the schools around the country that undertook this act. I give particular credit to the teachers and parents involved in each instance.",
                "It does now force us in Ireland to hold a mirror to ourselves in terms of how we would respond to any form of aggression that might be part of this. This is not just in terms of conventional military warfare. We saw the devastating impact of the cyberattack on the HSE a number of months ago and how that crippled its IT system. It is important that we recognise the very real threats that exist in regard to cyber warfare and the incursion of drones into our airspace. I am very proud that Baldonnel aerodrome is in my constituency and I encourage the new Minister for Defence to continue the rapid programme of investment in giving us radar capability to understand what is in our skies and to be able to respond accordingly. Again, that is not increasing militarisation; it is prudent safeguarding of the security of the country. It is important that we create a discussion where we look at other neutral countries that are not members of military alliances and the investment they make in their defence forces to ensure they can secure their neutrality and protect their borders in a balanced and reasonable way.",
                "To go back to my fundamental point, we cannot ignore the fact the war on European soil has brought into focus the very real threat that countries that are our European partners feel around the possibility of Russian aggression. We need to create a responsible space in this country to discuss this. It is a grey area and anyone on any side of this debate needs to accept there will be ambiguity in some of the terminology and some of the definitions we use. However, we need to open the conversation about how we safeguard our neutrality, how we stand in solidarity with our European allies and how we make sure our Defence Forces, of which we are all very proud and which have a proud legacy of peacekeeping, are equipped properly and that we have the equipment to keep Ireland safe, be it on land, air, sea or from cyber attacks. We must recognise that Ireland now is a very strategic economic, communications and digital location for not only companies but also our Government and our European partners. We must show that we are able to protect what we have, what we hold dear, and the European Union must show that it stands in solidarity with those countries that do feel that fear.",
                "That, ultimately, is a success of the European Union project. It shows the ability of smaller member states to be protected by others but also to allow them to punch above their weight in their influence in global affairs. It is important that we acknowledge this.",
                "Finally, I want to talk about peace in Ukraine. All of us across the European Union and across the world want peace in Ukraine, but we want a just peace. We do not want a peace that is forced by the might of larger countries because they have demonstrated military aggression. There is a role for the EU in safeguarding that peace and honouring that peace. It needs to be a fair peace, it needs a balanced approach to that peace and it needs to respect the fundamental principles at the heart of European liberal democracies, which are the integrity of the nation state, the ability of a state to protect its borders and, fundamentally, the right to self-determination for a country.",
                "If I have any last call to action it is: that we create a space in this country where we can have the discussion about security and defence policy without instantly running to the ramparts and saying, \"Neutrality is under threat\"; that we actually take account of the fact that the same people stood by us when we asked them for help 20 or 30 years ago or even ten years ago and that we show that same level of solidarity and we do not dismiss their concerns; that we make sure that the public debate in this country reflects the very real fear that is being felt in countries around the world; that we act as a Government and as a Dáil to ensure that our Defence Forces are well equipped to protect our country; and, ultimately, that we are seen as European partners who stand in solidarity, whatever form that may be, while also respecting our traditional military neutrality in this country."

                "I wish to speak to the gravity of what is happening on our Continent with the war in Ukraine. It continues to inflict devastating human and societal geopolitical damage and change. According to one of the latest briefings, the scale of the suffering is humongous. The bombardment of cities, with its civilian casualties and with its infrastructure under relentless attack, is severe and it must not be ignored. It is not at the top of the headlines in the news anymore but the war is happening still for those citizens of Ukraine. It is over three years since the full-scale and unprovoked invasion by Russia of Ukraine. The conflict stretches back years to the illegal annexation of Crimea. Let us make no mistake: this is not a war of defence by Russia, it is aggression. The enemy of peace is taking aim at civilians and the civilian infrastructure on which all modern life depends, including educational and health institutions. This is what we are witnessing in Ukraine. It is done unto them by Russia.",
                "When international borders can be changed by force and when international law becomes optional, the very underpinnings of our global orders are at risk. At the recent fifth Summit of the International Crimea Platform, the Taoiseach stated: \"We cannot allow force to be the means by which international borders are defined.\" As Europeans, we must continue to stand with Ukraine, not just with words but also with deeds. The people of Ukraine deserve the full support of the international community. Their struggle is our struggle. It is a struggle for respect, for sovereignty and for the rule of law. Ukraine is a sovereign and independent nation and it has to be afforded the fundamental right to peace, security and full respect for its internationally recognised borders. Justice is not just a luxury: it is a foundation of any lasting peace. We have to remember that. It is a matter of principle that we build a comprehensive, just and lasting peace for Ukraine. We have to sustain our humanitarian, financial and diplomatic support. There is no backing away from that. We have to push our EU and global partners for more sanctions and for more mechanisms to hold Russia to account. We have to insist that peace negotiations must respect Ukraine sovereignty and its territorial integrity. A ceasefire based on occupation, fear or forced surrender is not peace at all.",
                "As previous colleagues said, this is more than just a war on Ukraine, or Ukraine versus Russia: this is a war on Europe. It is a war on our moral compass and what we are used to on this Continent. We have to stand tall against it. Some might argue that as a neutral state, Ireland is compromised by taking such a firm stance on Ukraine but we absolutely are not, in the same way we are not compromised by taking a strong stance on Gaza and the horrific genocide being visited on the people of Gaza. Neutrality is not meant for moral indifference. It is not about standing silent when our larger neighbour tries to erase the smaller one. Our neutrality is a military neutrality, not an ethical or political neutrality, and certainly not a licence for inaction. If anything, I believe that our neutral status places a heavier responsibility upon us. We have to rely on international law, our sovereignty and our multilateral institutions to guarantee our own security and the security of Europe. When those very principles are being shredded by Russia's aggression, Ireland cannot simply watch from the sidelines. We have to make sure that we are not compromised and that we are compelled to act . If we allow a world where borders can be redrawn by force and where the UN Charter is treated as a footnote, small countries like us will be the first to lose. Supporting Ukraine is not a departure from neutrality; it is a defence of the international order that protects our neutral states in the first place. We must protect ourselves, as Deputy Moynihan said, in protecting our neutrality and in protecting our nation. We are under threat by being a very strong economic hub in Europe. We have to wake up to the reality that we have to make sure we can defend ourselves as a neutral state. I will support the new Minister for Defence when she is investing in our Defence Forces and investing in our radar and our capabilities because we must ensure that we protect ourselves."

                "As many other speakers have said, Putin's invasion of Ukraine is a bloody, unjustified and criminal endeavour, which has led to absolute carnage. That carnage continues. The scale of human devastation is unknown because both sides do not want to admit to how many people have been killed. Some estimates suggest that more than 1 million people have either lost their lives or have been injured and maimed. Ukraine admits to about 50,000 of its military personnel being killed, although some suggest that the numbers killed could be double that, and hundreds of thousands more have been injured and maimed. In Russia, some estimates suggest there might be 250,000 military personnel dead and hundreds of thousands more maimed and injured. One report I read recently suggested that Russian ministries had distributed more than 200,000 prosthetic limbs because so many soldiers are losing their arms and legs. It is disgusting.",
                "Undoubtedly Putin is the instigator of this unjustified and imperialist endeavour. The Taoiseach is absolutely correct to call it imperialism. The people of Ukraine have been absolutely justified in resisting this brutal invasion of their country. The problem I have, and it is why I believe our neutrality is in danger, is that the Government and European Union leaders go from that to say that their main concern in all of this is to defend the international rules-based order and our neutrality and imply that they have a consistent set of principles when it comes to opposing imperialism, brutal invasions and wars. That self-evidently is not true. We have had 19 rounds of sanctions imposed on Russia by the European Union but not a single round of sanctions by the European Union against Israel for the crimes it has committed against the Palestinian people, even when those crimes have reached the level of Israel being in the dock for genocide, and to my mind being undoubtedly guilty of genocide. There has not been a single round of sanctions.",
                "You would believe in here, with the speeches from the Ministers, that when they rightly describe Putin as a brutal imperialist thug that he is the only one in the world. There is barely a mention of the genocidal slaughter being inflicted on the Palestinians. That slaughter could not have happened were it not for another imperialist power, or several of them. The United States has armed Israel to commit the genocide against the Palestinians and is every bit as much an imperialist power as Putin and his regime or, indeed, the more minor players in the European Union, such as Germany, Britain, France and Italy, which have also provided the military means to Israel to continue the slaughter and refuse to impose any sanctions.",
                "If the United States and the European Union actually do not show any serious regard for international law, or for any sort of consistency when it comes to principles, is it a surprise that the signal sent out is that all of it is nonsense and the truth is you take what you can get through military means? I would go further and say that many in the European Union have long wanted to see a European army and to ratchet up military expenditure. By the way, in the European Union this expenditure had dramatically increased before Russia's invasion of Ukraine as part of the ongoing process of militarisation in the European Union and of NATO expansion. Russia spends a shocking 19% of GDP on arms. This is on military expenditure. It is starving and immiserating its own people. It spends $149 billion. Do you know how much NATO spends? It spends $1.5 trillion, which is ten times what Russia spends on arms.",
                "Thousands of billions of euro that should be going into health, housing, education and addressing the cost of living are used to make missiles, weapons, bullets and ammunition, which are then sold on if they are not used in this war and given to Israel, Saudi Arabia, dictatorships and brutal regimes all over the world, which are also guilty of inflicting horror on their populations. If we are serious about trying to stop the slaughter in Ukraine or anywhere else, we have to have consistent principles and we should not be aligning ourselves with any of these powers in the world that are guilty of this imperialist competition and militarism, which will drive this world into a very dangerous and dark place and which would make even Gaza and Ukraine not look like a tea party because it is so horrific. It could bring us to an even worse place."

                "It is now three years and nine months since Russia undertook its illegal invasion and occupation of Ukrainian territory. The impact of this war continues to be felt most immediately in Ukraine, where it is estimated around 15,000 civilians and up to 80,000 members of Ukrainian military are dead and the number of wounded in that country runs to hundreds of thousands. Notwithstanding their brutal dictatorial leaders, the Russian people have also suffered as a result of this war, with a death toll in that country estimated as running to hundreds of thousands. When we think of these huge numbers, we have to recognise that each one represents a despair and heartbreak brought to a family, always reminding us of the brutal cost of conflict. The impact of these wars has been huge in terms of disruption of trade and in terms of the undermining of norms of international law. The war has also been key driver in one of the most long-lasting cost-of-living crises that many of us have seen in our lifetime.",
                "Throughout this war Ireland has been steadfast in its support of Ukraine, and the forthcoming visit of President Zelenskyy here will be an opportunity for us as a country and for the Government to reiterate our position on this. As a country, we have provided more than €380 million in financial aid to Ukraine, in the context of humanitarian assistance and in the context of non-lethal military equipment and materials. However, I would argue that probably our most meaningful support provided to Ukraine is in the context of the safety and shelter that Ireland has given to tens of thousands of Ukrainians, which has been offered since the very first days of the illegal Russian invasion. Across three years and nine months more than 114,000 Ukrainians have claimed temporary protection here in Ireland. While estimates vary, it is believed that between 70,000 and 80,000 Ukrainian men, women and children continue to see Ireland as their home today.",
                "It is valuable to reflect on the sheer scale of the humanitarian response that we undertook as a country and how communities working with the Government, civil society and NGOs enabled tens of thousands of people to find homes, schools and basic provisions, and to find a sense of community and solidarity in what was undoubtedly one of the darkest times in many of their lives. As the Minister overseeing the initial accommodation response I met Ukrainians. In the very first weeks of the war I met some who had literally bundled up their families into a car as the war began and drove across Europe to Ireland and to Dublin. I remember in three or four situations people literally arrived at the doorstep of the Department of children on Baggot Street. They spoke to me and officials there and talked about what it was like to see bombs falling on their homes and to see an invading occupying force march down their street with tanks and jeeps. The conversations that I had with these very early arrivals will always stay with me. They will always be for me a strong reminder of why it is so important that countries around the world have provisions in place to make arrangements for those fleeing war and those fleeing conflict.",
                "Our country's response to the needs of Ukrainians was undertaken in an emergency situation. It was not always smooth and it was not always perfect but it did show the generosity of spirit and sense of solidarity that is the basis of so many communities around our country. For example, while there were teething problems with the pledged accommodation scheme undertaken by the Red Cross, it has subsequently been hugely successful. The International Red Cross now cites our pledged accommodation scheme as a model of how such a scheme can work elsewhere. What was really important in supporting it was the accommodation recognition payment. This allows for the independence of Ukrainian families. It allows for better integration with Irish families and communities. It was also far more cost-effective for the State versus hotel or guest house accommodation.",
                "Right now about 24,000 Ukrainians continue to be supported through the recognition payment. This payment was reduced earlier this year. I would be concerned about proposals to either reduce it further or, as has been suggested by some in the House, to remove it entirely. Research undertaken by Helping Irish Hosts and analysis undertaken by the Department of housing indicate the vast majority of accommodation in respect of which the payment is made was never rental property previously. The recognition payment has been hugely successful in opening up accommodation that was previously unused. Of course a payment of this scale should always be examined and kept under review, and if there are issues arising they can be addressed. We should be looking to see how something such as this, which is an incredibly successful model, can benefit other groups who need short-term accommodation. This should be the focus of the Government and not scrapping a scheme that is achieving so much."

I put on record our solidarity with them, rooted in the principles of the UN Charter and in our own history as a small State whose independence was hard won. In this Chamber in February, I said there can be no agreement on Ukraine without Ukraine. This principle is even more important today.

Since then, missiles and drones have continued to strike apartment blocks, energy networks and water systems, designed to break civilian morale and to weaponise winter. Against that brutality, what has struck me most in my dealings with Ukrainians, be it in Kyiv, my own constituency of Dún Laoghaire or here in Leinster House, is their resilience and their gratitude to Ireland. Earlier this year at a rally for Ukraine in Dublin, the chant of “Thank you, Ireland. Thank you, Ireland” rang out again and again. That is a message to every household that has opened its doors, to every school that has taken in Ukrainian children and to every community that has made space for new neighbours.",
                "I also acknowledge the work of colleagues beyond this House. Dublin MEP Barry Andrews was in Ukraine this week, seeing the situation on the ground and reinforcing Ireland’s position at a European level. His visit underlines that this is a cross-party, all-institution effort to keep Ukraine high on the agenda when other crises risk crowding it out. Russia’s war is not just an attack on Ukraine. It is a direct challenge to European security and to the rules-based international order. We have seen drones and missiles crossing into the airspace of EU and NATO states and hybrid attacks on critical infrastructure here and elsewhere. If we allow this to succeed, we send a message that borders can be changed by brute force and that smaller states are fair game. That is why Ireland’s role, though militarily non-aligned, is not as a bystander. We are firmly on the side of international law.",
                "We are contributing to Ukraine’s defence in a way that is consistent with our traditional policy of military neutrality - through non-lethal military assistance, humanitarian and development funding and training initiatives that help Ukraine to clear mines, protect civilians and keep basic services running. We have supported practical measures, such as bomb shelters for schools, so that education can continue under the threat of air raids. This is done in partnership with Lithuania. As a country that has benefited enormously from EU membership, we strongly support Ukraine’s path to the European Union and we want to see accession negotiations unblocked and accelerated.",
                "EU membership must form part of a broader set of security guarantees for Ukraine, alongside military, economic and political support. Russia cannot be allowed a veto over Ukraine’s European future. A critical question for Europe now is how we finance Ukraine’s long-term reconstruction and security needs. The European Union is examining how the profits and cash balances from immobilised Russian sovereign assets can be used to back a substantial reparation loan for Ukraine, alongside grants and other instruments. This principle is simple: Russia should pay for the destruction it has caused. Ireland has already committed significant humanitarian, development and non-lethal military support and our institutions have frozen large sums linked to the Russian regime under the EU’s sanctions regime.",
                "Finally, I welcome the intention of President Zelenskyy to visit the Oireachtas in December. That visit will be an important moment to reaffirm Ireland’s support, to hear directly from Ukraine's leadership about their needs and to demonstrate that the Oireachtas and the Irish people continue to stand with the people of Ukraine in their time of crisis. Our message should be clear and united that there can be no lasting peace built on fear, occupation or eroded rights. Peace will come when Russia ends its aggression and when Ukraine can live in security as a free European democracy, within the family of nations and, we hope, within the European Union."

However, goodwill must behold its shape. It must be fair and it must be sustainable. Across Europe, governments are adjusting their supports as the conflict continues. Germany has applied the same means test to those of its own citizens. The Czech Republic limits free accommodation to 90 days and has set modest monthly allowances. Poland has withdrawn its cash payments to private hosts. Slovakia has reduced its accommodation support by half.",
                "Ireland, one of the few states that has granted full welfare equivalent supports from the start, still gives a full medical card to every Ukrainian passport holder upon arrival, without a means test and without proof of prior residence in Ukraine. In a reply to a recent parliamentary question from me, the HSE confirmed that since 2022, more than €92 million has been spent on medical cards alone, consisting of €14.15 million in 2022, €24.2 million in 2023, €28.96 million in 2024 and €25.03 million in the first nine months of 2025.",

Many of our older citizens lose their medical cards because of small pension increases that push them over the threshold and face review after review, year after year. While the State has been able to fund large-scale supports for our new arrivals, our survivors of institutional abuse had to go on hunger strike for over 50 days outside the gates of this very Parliament to secure a modest pension uplift and a basic medical card for roughly 4,000 people.",
                "In recent years, the State has resourced many groups overnight but the survivors of these institutional abuses had to put their health on the line to be heard. That contrast gives rise to a serious question about the priorities of the Irish Government. This is not directed at Ukrainian families, as the Labour Party suggested in this House earlier; it is directed at a Government that treats groups of people differently based solely on political convenience rather than the needs of its own people. Fairness demands one standard. I ask the Government to ensure that we have one standard for everybody in this country."

                "I want to address Ireland's position under the EU migration and asylum pact. I have a clear question: can Ireland apply for an exemption? Under the pact, every EU member state must contribute to a solidarity mechanism to assist countries under migratory pressure. This means relocating asylum seekers, paying €20,000 per person not relocated, or providing operational support. There is no blanket opt-out but countries facing significant immigration challenges can apply for partial or full deductions. Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia and Poland are expected to seek such exemptions for 2026. Ireland is not currently on that list although the European Commissioners has flagged us as at risk of migratory pressure.",
                "Let us look at the facts. According to the Central Statistics Office, immigration hit historic highs in the year to April 2024 with 149,200 immigrants, which was the highest number in 17 years. In the year to April 2025, there were 125,300 immigrants, marking the fourth consecutive year above 100,000. In 2024, there was a record 18,560 asylum applications, ranking Ireland third in the EU per capita. The main countries of origin were Nigeria, Jordan, Pakistan, Somalia and Afghanistan. Since March 2022, more than 113,900 Ukrainians have received PPS numbers under temporary protection. About 80,000 still reside in Ireland. These figures clearly show that Ireland is under significant migration pressure, considering the extent of homelessness, the cost-of-living crisis, the waiting lists for basic operations and healthcare, the lack of crèches, the overcrowding in schools and the lack of transport for children attending school, and the lack of accommodation for students. The list goes on. Given this reality, will the Minister confirm whether Ireland intends to apply for an exemption or a deduction under the pact, and if not, why not? This is a critical question for transparency and for ensuring Ireland's interests are properly represented."

We must continue to assist Ukrainian refugees and offer protection and opportunities as a free nation. There are debates, of course, about the levels of support on an individual basis, some of which are valid and some are dog-whistling. However, we must always remember that we have Ukrainian guests with much to offer us, especially at a time when we cannot fill many types of jobs. We must build on the work that has been done to further integrate Ukrainians into the Irish way of life. We must provide supports but also incentives for them to work and improve their language skills further. We should educate them about our culture and our society. The same applies to any group that is genuinely fleeing persecution and war. However, we have a special duty to support Ukraine in different ways as an EU member state given our military neutrality.",

Until that regime changes, we have to do what we can to protect ourselves, support our fellow EU member states, support Ukraine and realise we are all in this together as Europeans."

                "I want to focus on a number of aspects of the Ukraine war and how it is so important to us here in Ireland. I want to speak first about the massive numbers who have died on both sides of the conflict. It is estimated that between 200,000 and 500,000 people have died on the Russian side and about half that on the Ukrainian side. This is a staggering number. It is happening in a European country that borders several EU countries. For the life of me I cannot understand why it is barely spoken about here nor mentioned in our main media outlets. Are the lives of hundreds of thousands of young men not important?",
                "Second, I want to raise the issue of missing children. Latest reports from experts at Yale University estimate that as many as 35,000 children may be held in Russia and its occupied territories. There is a network of 43 Russian facilities to which Ukrainian children have been moved since February 2022. It is thought that many have been sent to military camps or foster care or even adopted by Russian families. The Yale team has been able to establish the identities of thousands of children. It is likely the largest child abduction in war since the Second World War.",
                "Third, I want to talk about Ireland taking in people from Ukraine. Ireland has taken in more than 100,000 refugees from Ukraine. We have taken in by far the most in western Europe per capita and more in absolute numbers than France. This is commendable. However, I wonder whether we have really helped Ukraine by attracting some people who may have stayed. For example, in Ukraine businesses already crippled by blackouts and Russian missiles are suffering from a severe labour shortage. Most will never return.",
                "Fourth, I want to discuss the financing of Ukraine. Unless something changes, Ukraine is expected to have no money at the end of next February. In February of this year, after Mr. Trump entered the White House, monthly American financial allocations to Ukraine stopped. Ukraine has now borrowed as much as it can. It has an official fiscal deficit of about one fifth of GDP. Public debt has doubled as a share of GDP since before the war to about 110%. Ukraine cannot borrow any more. Its last hope is Europe. The annual war effort requires €100 billion, which is equal to about half of Ukraine's GDP. Europe's NATO members need to step up and fund Ukraine. It would go a long way to ensuring Europe's independence from the US. The alternative would be for Ukraine to lose the war, making Russia an even bigger threat. Spread across all NATO members, this is manageable. Europe has no choice. It also has a chance to speed up Europe's effort to establish its military and financial independence from America.",
                "Europe’s economy is ten times the size of Russia’s. Russia’s initial war boom has now given way to stagflation, with growth at almost zero, labour shortages, inflation of 8% and interest rates of 16.5%. Another few years of this would probably trigger an economic and banking crisis in Russia. If Europe can demonstrate to Russia that it will underwrite the war for at least that long, Russia may think differently. Europe needs to remain united in the face of Russia’s aggression. Ukraine is too big to fail."

                "We have to recognise that Ireland has played a major part in welcoming, as was said previously, up to 120,000 people from Ukraine. Of course, I welcome people who are working here, are in employment here and can stand on their own two feet here. However, when we read the headlines in the newspaper today, we see that Ireland paid over €1 billion last year and several billions for the past three or four years. We come in here day after day asking the Government for different things and pleading for our own needy people, whether the elderly, people in hospitals, children or whatever, and invariably we are told we do not have the money for different things. I cannot see how we can sustain this level of spending. Unless the Government can explain otherwise, that it has a separate fund or whatever, I cannot see how we are going to sustain spending that kind of money.",
                "Of course, we have a housing crisis here. At the start of the war the Government decided to pay towards accommodation for Ukrainians. It started with €800 tax free but it is now €600. I do not mind if the Government does the same for our people who were brought up here, are trying to live here and continue to stay here. However, it steadfastly refuses to give €600 per month to our people. That is not fair. I have to fight for our people too, and I make no bones about it. If the Government can give €600 a month tax free for a Ukrainian family, it should be able to do it for Irish people as well. I know what is happening with the housing list in Kerry and I understand very well the number of people who are left behind. If people's earnings go over a threshold of €37,000, they are thrown off the housing list.",
                "Another thing at stake here is our neutrality. I remember as a young fella hearing Éamon de Valera on the radio chastising Winston Churchill for trying to get us into the Second World War. He gave him his answer. We should keep that neutrality. I was disappointed when the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, said we are training Ukrainians to make soldiers out of them and we must stand with Ukrainians. We must maintain our neutrality whatever happens. We have no army. The Minister of State talked about us winning the war. Those were his words here. The Taoiseach said Russia must be made accountable. We cannot make it accountable."

                "When we talk about strategy or security policy, we have to begin thinking about the reality of this war. I have friends who have come from Ukraine and friends whose families are still in Ukraine. According to the United Nation’s report, and I am sure the Minister of State is well-aware of this as I have spoken to him about it before, the number of civilian casualties - this is something we are seeing across the world, that is, civilians being drawn into wars they had nothing to do with starting - is devastating. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, more than 53,000 civilians have been killed or injured. These are families and communities. These are my friends' families. It is difficult to see this and to speak to these people. At least 148 civilians were killed in October. Many players on the rugby team I play for are of Ukrainian descent. It is hitting us close to home as we are EU allies.",
                "The recent attacks in October and November triggered nationwide blackouts. What we are seeing with these targets is that we need to look at our own systems and protection. We should look at what Russia has been doing to Ukraine. That is something I continually pushed for last week with the former Minister for foreign affairs, the now Minister for Finance and the Tánaiste, regarding our offshore cables and how we need to protect them and, hopefully, decentralise our energy systems to prepare for this.",
                "To return to speaking about Ukraine, we have to be honest about this. Russia is engaging in hybrid aggression across the Continent, targeting electricity cables and gas pipelines in the Baltic Sea. Europe’s energy infrastructure has become a priority target. We have seen repeated incidents involving Russian-affiliated vessels interfering with various submarine cables. In December 2024, the Finnish authorities apprehended the Eagle S after it cut the Estlink 2 cable between Finland and Estonia. That ship had military grade detection equipment on its hull. That was not an accident; it was a message.",
                "Are we prepared? Our Defence Forces really needs to look into how we can look after our seas. How can the EU, as a whole, protect our energy? This obviously matters for Ireland as an island that depends almost entirely on undersea cables, although we have a lot onshore, for our connectivity, our banking and our economy. These cables carry all of these transactions and if they were to be damaged, it would be absolutely devastating. We need to have back-up protection. If there was hybrid interference or direct sabotage, the consequences would be immediate and severe. As I am sure the Minister of State is well aware, every European warning and Baltic incident tells us the same thing. We cannot assume we are safe simply because we are offshore or because we are not part of a military alliance. Neutrality without capability is vulnerability.",
                "How do we respond? One part is obvious. Our Defence Forces need the capability to monitor, defend and respond to both cyber and physical threats. As a neutral, sovereign nation, strengthening our defence is very important and a necessity. I go back to private wires in the sense that local energy hubs supporting long-duration storage give communities and critical services back-up in case we are attacked. By decentralising supply and removing single points of failure, we make Ireland far more secure against these hybrid attacks."

There has been a massive increase in resources to our cyberdefence capability. There has been the setting-up of a maritime defence system to make sure those undersea cables can be monitored. We need to acknowledge the requirement for co-operation on defence. That does not mean joining any alliances or anything like that.

He was given his time; I am given my time to respond for the Government. Respectfully, I will continue without interruption, if that is all right.",
                "When we talk about solidarity with Ukraine and the cost of providing supports to the Ukrainian people, being humanitarian and welcoming people into our homes and homesteads, we also have to ask the cost of not doing that. What is the cost of a Russian victory in Ukraine? Whether we like it or not, or believe in some form of splendid geographic isolation, a Russian victory across Ukraine would have a massive impact on the Continent of Europe and on the European Union, of which we are a member. If Ukraine falls, where is next - the Baltic states, Poland? We have already seen transgressions of drones into European Union airspace, hybrid warfare activity and systems attacked in Estonia. Our own health system was hacked a number of years ago and sent offline by a criminal gang that was operating with impunity in the Russian Federation. We see levels of disinformation and misinformation online throughout the electoral process in countries like the Netherlands, France and Austria. As I have stated before, over 50 Members of this House find themselves sanctioned by the Russian Federation due to the diktat of the ambassador in Orwell Road simply for saying clearly that the Russian war is illegal.",
                "There are tools for accountability. When we talk of sanctions and enter into the 19th round of EU sanctions against Russia, that is accountability. When we talk of freezing Russian assets, that is accountability. The Irish Government's position is clear that there is the ability to use the proceeds of frozen assets to pay for the repair and reconstruction of the Russian damage in Ukraine. That is a policy we are keen on in terms of accountability. When we set up the tribunal at the Council of Europe, that was backed. I travelled to Ukraine and to Lviv for the signing ceremony to which Ireland, with a number of countries from Europe and around the world, were party. There has to be accountability. There has to be work in the international criminal courts because Russia's invasion of Ukraine is illegal. We see consistent reports of Russian activity within Ukrainian territory. The Taoiseach detailed at length the forced kidnapping of children from the Ukrainian territory into Russia. We see attacks on food and energy, which are deemed war crimes. There has to be accountability for that.",
                "The Irish people have made it clear that they stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine. They have opened their hearts and homes. The Government has made it clear that we stand with our European friends and colleagues in support of a fellow European nation that has had its sovereignty invaded by an illegal force, whichc has breached repeated international treaties to which it is party, as is Ukraine.",
                "We look to the future and the future has to be clear. We want peace on this Continent because the impacts of the war are being materially felt by Irish people on a daily basis. Our grocery and energy prices are high due to the inflationary process of Russia's war in Ukraine. Ukraine was the breadbasket of Europe in terms of the production of grain. That has been severely hampered by the acts of Russia. Ukraine was a key provider of natural gas and a key facilitator of the travelling of natural gas and other raw minerals across the European Continent. Energy prices have gone up due to Russia's illegal invasion and attacking of pipelines, among other things. This war, as well as being horrific, is taking so many lives.",
                "Deputy Heneghan speaks of the Ukrainian community he represents. I take issue in that I do not think he quite plays at the same level as the Soroka brothers but I know they are members of the same club. We are talking about people seeing their families wiped out and seeing their husbands, sons and fathers being sent to war because they have no choice. If you really want to talk brass tacks, this hurts Irish people in the pocket as well as being a potential existential threat to the future of European safety and security and the freedom and democracy we all cherish in this Republic.",
                "We must continue our support of the Ukrainian people until there is peace in Ukraine that allows for the reconstruction of Ukraine and the reintroduction of Ukraine into the global world order and, equally, until we see Ukraine in due course take its rightful seat as a fellow member of the European Union. That is something Ireland supports. Ireland supports European enlargement more generally, but having Ukraine as part of the European Union would be good for Ukraine, the European Union and, crucially, Ireland. I thank the Deputies from all parties and none who contributed to this debate."

                "The Mercosur trade deal is bad for Irish agriculture, European consumers and the global environment. It is a deal that has been spoken about for a long time. It has been negotiated between the EU and the Mercosur countries in Latin America for over 25 years. Those negotiations are now over. There are no more negotiations for this deal. The deal is the deal. It is done, or so we are told. It will be voted on in an EU Council meeting in the next few weeks.",
                "The final EU-Mercosur trade agreement has been widely criticised for harming Irish and EU farmers, undermining climate goals, potentially affecting public health and bypassing democratic scrutiny.",
                "This is a bad deal for Ireland and a bad deal for the EU. The threat to Irish agriculture is very real, especially to our suckler and beef industries and to our poultry sector, which is important and under huge pressure the moment, as the Minister will be aware, with the bird flu pandemic sweeping across the country, potentially causing huge harm. I am sure he is aware this deal is bad for Ireland as this has been reported over the years.",
                "As it currently stands, Mercosur beef is being imported into the EU. In total, approximately 105,000 tonnes of beef and 68,000 tonnes of frozen beef are being imported into the EU annually. Some 58,000 tonnes of this beef has a tariff of 20% on it at the moment under the Hilton quota. The rest has a tariff of between 40% and 50%. The Minister can therefore imagine how cheaply Mercosur countries are producing this substandard beef when they can make profits like this selling beef at a 40% to 50% tariff. Under the Mercosur deal, 58,000 tonnes will have zero tariff and a further 99,000 tonnes will be at a 7.5% tariff. Anything over that will be up to 40% or 50%. There is no limit to the volume of beef that can come from Brazil into the European Union. There is simply a limit to how much will be tariff free or have a low tariff. That is what this deal does.",
                "The Minister and I are aware of the issues with South American beef. Animal welfare standards are considerably poorer than in Ireland and the rest of the EU and there is no traceability of cattle and no tagging of animals at all. Ireland and the EU have the highest standards of animal welfare and food security in the world and this agreement weakens the EU's food safety checks and auditing powers, which will allow importation of products produced with banned pesticides, hormones and antibiotics. This increases the risk of unsafe agricultural products entering the EU market.",
                "This deal is disastrous for the environment. It is seen as incompatible with the EU's Paris Agreement commitments. It is expected to increase exports of deforestation-linked products such as beef and soya, driving the destruction of the Amazon and raising greenhouse gas emissions. The EU's attempt to appease member states that are opposed to this deal by proposing safeguards and a so-called handbrake clause does nothing to protect Irish or EU farmers. There would have to be a decline of 10% in the EU market price to trigger the safeguards and there is a high legal threshold that requires proof that the decline in price is a consequence or result of imports from Mercosur. This safeguard is not preventative. It addresses harm only after it has been caused and does not fix the structural issues, including unequal production standards and environmental costs. If this deal is ratified, it will result in the loss of jobs in Irish agriculture and we will see further decline in the Irish suckler industry, which is already under huge strain. We have seen declining numbers in the suckler herd, particularly in the north west and along the western seaboard.",
                "We are trying to promote generational renewal in Irish agriculture but there is no point in incentivising young farmers to take over the farm on the one hand and pulling the rug out from under them on the other by supporting the Mercosur trade deal. Irish farmers cannot compete with cheap beef from South America that is substandard, with no traceability regulations and poor animal welfare standards, produced at the cost of the environment.",
                "Irish farmers cannot be sacrificed for German cars to be sold in South America. The Government has neglected its responsibility when it comes to defending Irish farmers and has sat back. It has a wait and see approach to the Mercosur trade deal. Its response has always been that it is opposed to the deal in its current form. Well, negotiating is over. The deal is not going to change and in the next four weeks the Government must stand up for Irish farmers and reject the Mercosur trade deal. This deal can only be stopped if the Government engages with like-minded member states and forms a blocking minority at EU Council level."

Farms like mine in south Kilkenny and that of the Minister in Kildare have been passed down from one generation to the next. Like the Minister's children, my children are growing up on a suckler farm, like so many sons and daughters across Ireland who have grown up farming and working the land. It is much more than a job; it is a way of life. It is a passion that has ensured our farmers reach higher and higher standards. I want a future where our sons and daughters on farms across Ireland can make a decent living while producing the highest quality of food. I give them our word that we will damn well fight for that future.",
                "We should be under no illusion. The Mercosur agreement will create a race to the bottom. For the wider public, the changes will be subdued. Beef that is 100% Irish will start disappearing from menus. Instead, people across Ireland will be served beef that is not traceable and not grass-fed, but reared indoors on banned growth hormones and genetically modified feed. It will devastate the rainforests. Hundreds of thousands of acres are being cleared in South America right now, specifically to produce more of this cheap beef for the EU market. This undermines everything we stand for. Food produced in Ireland and the EU is held to the highest standards. Mercosur countries could not be further from our high standards. Their practices would be considered a public health risk if they were used in the EU. This deal imports their lowest standards and puts the public at risk. Let us be clear: Mercosur is a bad deal for Irish farmers and a bad deal for public health and must be rejected.",
                "Supporting the Mercosur trade agreement would be a betrayal of Irish farming and rural communities. It would involve selling out those who have often stood with the Minister, just so German businessmen can make millions of euro more selling cars and chemicals to South America. That will be the Minister's legacy if a firm stand is not taken now. He has a clear choice. I urge him to stand with ordinary people and stop Ireland being sold out for cheap imports and to protect Irish agriculture by backing this motion."

Will it stand with Irish farmers, rural communities and our domestic food sector or will it allow the Mercosur trade deal to sell them out?",
                "Much was said by the Government in the past year and in the run-up to the general election about opposing the Mercosur deal, but the real test is upon it. Let us call the Mercosur deal what it is. It is a bad deal for our beef and suckler farmers, for the environment, for the world and for Ireland. I welcome those in the Public Gallery from the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers Association, ICSA, the Irish Farmers Association, IFA and other organisations. Every farming organisation in this country opposes the Mercosur deal. Every farmer who depends on a fair price, strong standards and a level playing field knows exactly what this agreement will mean. The EU will allow 99,000 tonnes of beef and 180,000 tonnes of poultry to flood into the European market, much of it produced under standards that would be illegal here. Irish farmers meet the highest levels of traceability, animal welfare and environmental regulation anywhere in the world. There is no equivalent system in Mercosur countries. There are no checks. There is no transparency and no balance. Cattle are not even tagged in many cases. Hormones, pesticides and antibiotics that are banned here and are illegal to use in the European Union are routinely used in production in Mercosur countries; yet the Government will allow that product to compete directly with Irish beef. It is not just unfair; it is a threat to public health and food security.",
                "We are told to trust the so-called safeguard clause but it is nothing more than a political smokescreen. It will not protect Irish farm incomes and will not reverse the structural damage this agreement will cause. Environmentally, the consequences are devastating. As mentioned, the impact on the Amazon at a time of runaway climate change cannot be overstated. Tonight, Sinn Féin is asking this House to send a clear, united message, that Ireland says \"No\" to the Mercosur trade agreement. We are asking the Minister and his Government to send a clear message to the European Union, the Council and the Commission that we oppose the Mercosur trade agreement and that the Irish State will not accept it as a deal.",

                "The Government can still choose to defend Irish agriculture. It is not too late to defend Irish standards and Irish jobs. It should support this motion, stand with farmers, and reject Mercosur."

It is undemocratic and a betrayal of the Irish people. The Government must be honest that this Mercosur deal is fundamentally incompatible with climate science. It exposes the hypocrisy of the Government, von der Leyen and the Commission, in allowing 99,000 tonnes of untraceable South American beef and 180,000 tonnes of poultry into the EU market at reduced tariffs. These imports are not subject to the same standards. They fall far short of the high bar we expect from Irish farmers, who produce high-quality food for EU citizens and at the same time provide public goods. This is all being sacrificed for the benefit of global corporations in the automotive and pharma sector to sell cars, insurance and wine. The Government is signing up to a deal that will decimate the Earth's lungs and will reward production linked to the deforestation of the Amazon and the Sierra Nevada, two of the most critical ecosystems on our planet.",

On prices, we still have the diktats coming from factories and retailers, and we have never got a stranglehold on the conglomerate interests that are controlling the prices received. On CAP, we now have a situation where farmers are receiving fewer payments but are being asked to do more and more every year.",

The first thing I mean by that is a recognition that the farmers in the Gallery tonight and across this country produce food to the highest standards and with the highest number of regulations in the world. Nowhere outside of the European Union matches the controls on farmers in respect of the climate, the environment, animal welfare and biodiversity. Yet, while they are expected to meet all of those obligations, they are also expected to compete with states and farmers which do not have to adhere to the same level of regulation. That is unfair. Not only are they expected to compete, we are now being faced with a trade deal that wants to tip the balance in favour of those farming organisations that do not adhere to the same regulations.",
                "The approach by successive Governments on this matter has been very cynical. I have heard Ministers from Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael over the past decade and a half indicating that they oppose the Mercosur deal. They never say that the only reason Mercosur is on the table at all is an Irish Government signed up to a negotiating mandate and permitted the European Commission to open negotiations when it could have said, \"Stop\" when a unanimity principle was in place. They do not say that there were countless occasions over the past decade where the Irish Government could have stopped the Mercosur negotiations in their tracks and failed to do so. They do not say, loud and clear, so that the European Commission can hear, that Ireland will not accept a lunacy whereby, in this House, we have people talking about cutting herds in Ireland and Europe, while at the same time importing hundreds of thousands of tonnes of beef from the far end of the world, and literally mowing down rainforests to produce that beef. The lunacy has to stop now. We need clear, unequivocal language that the European Commission hears. We, the Irish people, will not accept the Mercosur trade deal."

From an enterprise, tourism and employment perspective, I recognise exactly what is at stake here. Irish agriculture underpins tens of thousands of rural jobs, small businesses, agritourism ventures, transport, food processing and hospitality. When the family farm is undermined, the entire rural economy is undermined. The deal would flood the EU market with 99,000 tonnes of beef and 180,000 tonnes of poultry. Irish farmers are required to meet the highest animal welfare, traceability and environmental standards in the world but now they will be forced to compete with cheaper, substandard imports, produced with hormones and chemicals banned here for decades.",

The so-called emergency brake is not worth the paper it is written on. It is temporary, weak, and entirely inadequate to prevent job losses, market distortion or the slow death of the family farm. There is much more I could say but I need to hand over to my colleague. The Minister needs to stop dithering. He needs to reject this agreement publicly and to work with like-minded states to build a blocking minority to this disastrous deal."

                "Trade and our relationships with partners around the world are a central feature of the Irish economic model. Ireland’s story is one of openness - openness to the world, to trade, to new ideas and to new partnerships. Unlike nations whose wealth is rooted in vast natural resources or the legacies of conquest, Ireland’s prosperity comes from something different - the talent of our people, our capacity for innovation, high quality agricultural produce and an outward-facing economy that looks to the world rather than to itself. We are a small country with a global voice, a trusted partner known for being honest, principled and constructive.",
                "Our membership of the European Union is central to that story. It amplifies our voice, strengthens our influence and enables us to advocate for solutions that work for Ireland, Europe and the wider global economy. However, we cannot be complacent. The international environment is more volatile, more unpredictable and more transactional than at any time in recent decades. Through the EU, we have been part of an expanding network of free trade agreements that create opportunities for exports and investment, support jobs and growth at home, and uphold EU standards in food safety, animal and plant health and environmental protection. These agreements help to promote EU values globally, from labour standards to human rights to climate action. For a nation that exports 90% of the food and drink we produce, trade is crucial. Indeed, Irish agriculture has directly benefited from many of the EU trade agreements. As an example, Irish agrifood exports to Japan have increased significantly since the EU-Japan economic partnership came into effect in 2019. For context, within five short years, by 2024, Irish agrifood exports to Japan were valued at €162 million across categories such as dairy, pigmeat and beef, trade only made possible by that EU-Japan economic partnership.",
                "Ireland’s economic strength is rooted in openness. We have enjoyed robust economic performance in recent years, with near full employment and real jobs growth across every region. Our action plans on market diversification and on competitiveness and productivity outline how we will continue to build resilience and ensure Ireland remains an attractive and competitive location for investment and job creation. In short, trade is essential for Ireland. It is the only credible way for us to sustain the jobs and investment our people rely on. However, balance will always be essential.",
                "We have always been clear that EU trade agreements must defend our most vulnerable sectors and that our farmers’ livelihoods must not be undermined through weak or ineffective environmental standards in other countries. In that regard, Ireland has, over a number of years, raised specific concerns about the EU-Mercosur agreement, both regarding our agricultural sensitivities and the strength of the original commitments around trade and sustainability. In September, the European Commission presented its final package of proposals on the EU-Mercosur agreement for adoption by the Council and the European Parliament. This followed some 25 years of negotiations.",
                "Foremost in my mind have been the sensitivities in agriculture in particular, and especially in the beef sector, as well as the concerns around trade and sustainability. As part of the agreement, the EU will grant Mercosur a beef quota at a reduced tariff of 99,000 tonnes, phased in over a six-year period. An economic and sustainability impact assessment, commissioned by the Government, estimated that the resulting increase in beef imports into the EU could lead to a reduction in the value of Irish beef output of between €44 million and €55 million. Concerns have also been raised that Mercosur countries do not operate to the same standards in the production of food, with the potential for negative impacts on the environment, animal welfare and food safety. Ireland and like-minded member states have repeatedly raised such concerns with the Commission and pushed for increased protections for our farmers.",
                "The Commission has set out flanking measures to the overall agreement, focused on addressing concerns raised by the agricultural sector. These include a new legal act covering safeguards for sensitive agricultural products, a financial safety net for farmers, and stronger commitments on production standards and sanitary and phytosanitary compliance.",
                "Ireland has also sought stronger trade and sustainability commitments. We have been clear that the original 2019 text did not go far enough. We raised these concerns repeatedly. We welcomed the fact that the Commission returned to negotiations with Mercosur to strengthen the sustainability chapter.",
                "The resulting legal instrument agreed in December last year seeks to address the concerns raised by Ireland and other EU partners. These changes must be assessed carefully and comprehensively. We have repeatedly emphasised Ireland’s requirements for credible, legally-binding commitments on matters relating to trade and sustainable development, including climate, biodiversity and deforestation protections.",
                "The Government also has concerns about the preferential access being given to Mercosur if South American farmers are not subject to the same sustainable farming standards as our own farmers. It is important to note, in terms of food safety, animal and plant health - SPS standards, as they are known - that the EU’s standards are among the highest in the world. The Commission has consistently stated that these are not up for negotiation. However, production standards go beyond SPS standards and take in other issues, such as environmental sustainability. Irish and EU farmers are held to a very high standard in terms of how they produce food. I have spoken on numerous occasions about concerns about preferential access being granted when farmers in the Mercosur bloc may not be subject to the same sustainable farming standards as our own. As Minister, I have had the opportunity to raise these and other concerns at Agri-Fish Council meetings since my appointment earlier this year. I have also held numerous bilateral meetings on the margins of the Council and, as recently as yesterday, I met again in Brussels with my French and Italian counterparts.",
                "The EU-Mercosur agreement is seen by many EU countries and by the European Commission as a strategic tool for economic growth, competitiveness and supply chain security. The current global trade landscape is resulting in member states reassessing their position. There is increasing pressure within the EU to move forward on this agreement despite the Government’s best efforts to engage with like-minded member states on this. The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and I, as Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, have firmly advocated for Irish farmers at EU meetings and with the Commission. The Government has been examining the final package in its entirety to determine whether our concerns have been fully addressed and whether the necessary balance has been achieved. We have been doing this rigorously, in consultation with like-minded member states and with stakeholders, including our farming communities, who have a direct and legitimate interest in this agreement.",
                "The Commission’s recent proposal gives some clarity on the legal structure they foresee for the agreement, whereby it will be a “split” agreement. This means that the interim trade agreement, ITA, which would include the trade pillar of the agreement, can be ratified at EU level. This can be done through adoption by qualified majority vote, QMV, through the Trade Council and by a simple majority at the European Parliament. For the QMV vote, a blocking minority would be required to prevent adoption of the agreement. This requires at least four member states, representing over 35% of the EU population, voting against or abstaining on the proposal. It is fair to say that, right now, it is far from clear that a blocking minority exists.",
                "Ireland supports open, fair, rules-based trade. We value our membership of the EU and the opportunities that being part of the largest trading bloc brings. However, we also support a balanced approach that protects our most vulnerable sectors and ensures that international agreements uphold the highest standards of sustainability, environmental protection and labour rights. Supporting open trade does not oblige us to support every trade agreement in any form. This is the approach we have taken throughout the EU-Mercosur agreement negotiating process in seeking to protect our interests and mitigate our concerns. It is the approach we have continued to take as we examine this final package.",
                "With the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, my Department continues to examine the proposals in detail and will continue to engage with the Commission to ensure that Ireland’s concerns are fully taken on board. Pending that examination and the completion of ongoing engagement, Ireland's position on the EU-Mercosur agreement remains as clearly outlined in the programme for government. The Government fully recognises the concerns raised in this motion regarding the proposed EU-Mercosur agreement, particularly in relation to Irish agriculture, the need for robust trade and sustainability commitments, and the importance of our rural economy, which every Member of this House accepts. In that context, the Government will not oppose today’s motion. The Government is committed to continuing discussions and engagement with other member states and with the Commission in the coming weeks ahead of any final Council vote."

He has not said that, and I do not think that will fill farmers with faith."

Knowing where our food comes from, its production method and its journey to our tables allows us to make decisions on quality, freshness, nutrition and environmental sustainability. More importantly, it allows us to make decisions on supporting local farmers and producers.",

As a country, we worked hard to reach the high standard. Our farmers worked hard on this. What will all that hard work amount to and where will we stand if we allow cheap imports from Mercosur countries with lower standards? Our family farms are struggling as it is, and this deal will be so bad for farmers and the production of healthier food.",

Six years will bring us to the end of 2031, yet at the COP26 climate change summit our Taoiseach, along with more than 100 governments, signed a pledge promising to halt and reverse deforestation by 2030. Where does that pledge lie now? Is this going to be another broken promise? Are the lungs of our world going to continue to be decimated? How much more stored carbon is going to be released? Experts say we are at a tipping point, a point of no return.",
                "On top of all that, this agreement would allow Mercosur countries to sue if the EU deforestation regulation or any future environmental or social legislation affected their exports to the EU. How anyone can believe this deal will be good for farmers, our country’s health and our climate is beyond me."

This could be exploited to further undermine EU regulations around climate, workers’ rights and health standards. The agreement puts the health of our people at risk. It will facilitate a race to the bottom in poultry and beef standards. There is no test for the antibiotics put into beef or poultry imported from Brazil.

That is cowardly and unacceptable. This is a bad deal for Irish farmers. The Government must not allow Irish farmers to be undercut by South American imports, it must not allow Irish farmers to be sacrificed for the sake of German car manufacturers, and it must not allow the EU to undermine Irish agriculture yet again. Therefore, it is time for it to get off the fence. I call on it to protect Irish agriculture and reject this deal outright."

Trade deals must serve the environment and climate protection, rather than putting the climate under greater pressure and exposing it to greater destruction. I have grown up hearing constantly from the State, activists and farmers that the distance between farm and fork should be short. We should take pride in local produce and we should strive to buy local and support local. This proposed trade deal flies in the face of that narrative.",

Irish farmers have made strenuous efforts to reduce their carbon footprints in line with Government policy and they are doing their best to help us to meet our legally binding climate targets, whether the narrative tells that or not. They have rightful concerns about their livelihoods and the value of their produce under the proposed deal.",

We must always be cognisant of workers’ rights and conditions in our trade deals, no matter where in the world they are. What should benefit workers in Europe should also benefit workers in South America. We already see the severe destruction of the rainforest and the lagging behind of workers’ rights in agriculture. The fear we have is that a trade deal lacking in these areas is going to create severe problems for both workers and the environment. I am not casting negativity on South American countries. Indeed, the European Union and countries within it, including Ireland, are severely lacking in protections for workers and actions and policies to combat climate change. Perhaps this is why concern is so well founded. The European Union and Mercosur countries do not prioritise ordinary workers and the environment enough.",
                "The beef produced in South America is not subject to the same strict requirements as beef produced in Europe in respect of traceability, animal welfare and health and safety. Beef can be produced cheaper and in greater quantity compared to here. It can also be produced without any regard to environmental standards. I am not opposed to a trade deal between the European Union and Mercosur countries, but I want the trade deals made at this level to benefit workers and ensure that our environment is protected, jobs are not lost and family farms and farmers’ livelihoods are protected. The value of the beef sector in Ireland must also be protected internationally. That is why we would welcome a genuine partnership between the EU and Mercosur, as long as it is built on strong workers’ rights, environmental protection and the security of our farming industry. The proposed deal, however, does not convince me in that regard.",

Traditionally, our local supermarkets, pubs, cafés and businesses were established initially to provide services and products for local people. Many people have been employed in creameries, co-ops and State agencies or as farm labourers and farmers. Those of us who live and have grown up in rural Ireland know well the importance of agriculture. They do not know that, perhaps, here in the centre of Dublin. While rural economies have grown and diversified, we know the vital role agriculture has in our local economies. We have much pride in our local produce and support for Irish farmers can be found across our communities.",

The Department said the Irish Government should be able to obtain these moneys for farmers who lose out, but speaking before the committee on agriculture, a Department of agriculture official said there would be a high threshold for accessing EU support. They are taking farmers for granted. They are trying a small bit to make them into fools.",

Certain pesticides are banned for use in the EU, although EU companies can still manufacture and sell products containing them elsewhere, including to Mercosur countries. Farmers in Mercosur countries could then sell these products, which use these pesticides that are deemed unsafe for the environment and human health, back to Europe.

The Minister has seven pages here in this speech about Mercosur and, my goodness, there is vague and watery language. There is talk of \"repeatedly emphasising\", \"the text did not go far enough\", \"the Government has concerns\", and \"examining the final package\". Nowhere in this speech does he say this Government is opposed to Mercosur. Nowhere in this speech has he stated that Ireland will formally or has formally opposed this deal. That is exactly what we needed to hear from the Minister tonight. It is what people in the Gallery needed to hear. Instead, it is wishy-washy language.",
                "In May this year, I raised this issue with the Tánaiste. I asked specifically what countries he was talking with to ensure we can have a minority blocking group on this matter. I asked him who he was working with. Similarly, I got fluffy language back but nothing definite. I was told we were having meetings. Where are the results of those meetings? Why is the Minister not able to say we are absolutely 100% against this deal and we will fight hard for our rural communities when it comes to it? Turning to Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and, indeed, the Independents, who have been lambasting me recently-----"

                "I am not specifically talking about the Minister of State. I am talking about the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Healy-Rae. Where is he tonight? He is not here for this debate. Where is his support for rural communities when it comes to Mercosur? Is he just going to roll over and accept it because Europe says so?",
                "In relation to this deal, the numbers speak for themselves. The Mercosur trade deal will allow 99,000 tonnes of beef into the EU annually at a reduced tariff rate of 7.5%. These will not just be low-value cuts. They will be premium steaks and striploin fillets, the very products Irish farmers rely on to fetch to fair prices in European markets. Ireland exports roughly 440,000 tonnes of beef every year, which is worth €2.8 billion. Meat Industry Ireland, MII, estimates that Mercosur could cost our beef industry between €100 million and €130 million annually. This represents a loss of between €75 and €95 per head of cattle. Suckler farmers are already operating on razor-thin margins and will now be pushed to the brink. Family farms will be lost and rural Ireland will suffer. No amount of plámasing from the Healy-Raes or the Ministers will make up for that loss.",
                "I also want to mention that it is very important Sinn Féin has included poultry in this motion because sometimes I think we do not have the debate in relation to poultry and the impact Mercosur will have on poultry producers. They are often sidelined in this debate. They will, however, face immediate and severe exposure under Mercosur. The deal allows 180,000 tonnes of poultry into the EU under a five-year transition period. In one year alone, 30,000 tonnes will enter. This is equivalent to the entire annual Irish chicken breast meat production of 1.2 billion fillets. To put it plainly, a single year of Mercosur imports could wipe out the domestic market for a cornerstone product of our poultry sector. Brazilian poultry is sold at less than half the price of its EU equivalent. That price differential reflects very different input costs, regulatory standards and production practices. In essence, that price differential reflects a significantly lower-quality product. Irish producers cannot compete on price with imports produced under such conditions nor should they have to. The EU already imports 400,000 tonnes of poultry meat annually. Adding Mercosur volumes risks flooding the market with cheap imports and will devastate local producers and seriously undermine our food sovereignty, something becoming more and more important in an increasingly unstable world.",
                "This deal is not just bad for our farmers, however. I will always speak up for the environment when it needs someone in here to speak for it. This deal is bad for the environment and our planet. Mercosur countries, especially Brazil, have been the focus of intense international concern over deforestation, land conversion and weak enforcement of environmental laws. Large areas of the Amazon rain forest have been cleared at alarming rates to make way for cattle ranching and soya production, releasing vast stores of carbon and destroying biodiversity. It is hard to miss the bitter irony of COP 30 being hosted in the heart of the rain forest as it disappears before our very eyes.",
                "The optics are bleak but the reality is much worse. While global leaders meet to discuss climate action, the ecosystems those negotiations rely on are being actively degraded around them. Approving a trade deal that increases market access for commodities linked to that degradation risks locking in supply chains that perpetuate high emissions and environmental harm. Irish farmers are being asked to meet ever stricter sustainability standards, adopt climate-smart practices and absorb the cost of decarbonisation. Meanwhile, imports produced with lower environmental safeguards-----"

Embedding references to the Paris Agreement into the text might provide political signalling but without binding enforceable environmental conditionality, it will not close the gap. If we are serious about protecting farmers, defending environmental standards and asserting food sovereignty, we must insist on treaty language that goes beyond rhetoric. This means concrete, enforceable obligations, automatic remedies for demonstrated competitive distortions and a transparent independent monitoring regime with teeth. Anything else will leave Irish producers paying the price of diplomacy dressed up as progress.",

Brazil's beef farmers are known to use pesticides banned in the EU and reports have highlighted carcinogenic residues, antibiotic overuse, with poor traceability. Indeed, the use of hormones, such as estradiol, are used in some Mercosur production systems. This is a hormone that is banned in the EU due to cancer risks. How can we stand by our children consuming that? Overuse of antibiotics in intensive production contributes to antimicrobial resistance, weaker pesticide control and increases the risk of carcinogenic residues. In 2017, the EU banned Brazilian meat for a period because of these systemic failures.",

I do not mean the Government should go to the newspapers and talk about how it does not think it should go through. I do not mean standing up here in the Dáil and pretending or using rhetoric to suggest it is objecting to it. I mean it should actually go to the table and say this Government will not support it. That is what is necessary. There should be no more talk in the papers, no more press releases, no more fluffy language or pretending the Government is going to do something, treating farmers like they have not a notion what it is doing. They know exactly what the Government is doing. They know they are not being represented by it. They know they are not being represented by the Independents on those benches and by that kind of behaviour we have seen here tonight."

                "I am pleased to speak in this debate today on behalf of the Green Party. I thank Sinn Féin for putting forward the motion. The Mercosur agreement and the trade deal that it increasingly looks like this Government is going to support is not just environmentally catastrophic. It will be economically devastating for Irish agriculture. It will open the floodgates to cheap beef from industrial-scale operations across South America, where production costs are minimal. That is due to weak labour law protections, environmental laws that are minimal and a sector that is pumped up with toxic agrochemicals, many of which are actually banned in the European Union. How can Irish family farms compete with beef that is fattened on land that has been ripped from the Amazon and sprayed with substances that would land an Irish farmer in court if he or she used those same substances?",
                "One element of the Mercosur deal that is not being recognised in the Irish context is the chemical warfare embedded in the agreement. While South American agriculture will flow to Europe, that will mean there is a trade imbalance, and that will be evened out by billions' worth of pesticides going the other direction. Many of these are so toxic that the EU has actually banned them: carcinogens that cause cancer; endocrine disruptors that block the body's normal functioning of our hormones; neonic synthetic pesticides that are toxic to pollinators; and chemicals that contaminate the soil and water for generations. In Brazil alone, approvals for highly contaminating and hazardous pesticides have surged in recent years, as have their sales.",
                "Meanwhile, the environmental carnage accelerates. The Mercosur deal rewards more cattle ranching, more soy plantations and more deforestation of the Amazon. Indeed, this deal represents a deforestation machine. It will drive climate collapse while farmers in other parts of the world are working constructively to reduce their own emissions as they are here in Ireland and across the European Union.",
                "Finally, there is the human cost. Indigenous communities are being displaced, poisoned, persecuted and even killed to clear lands for the exports that this deal is designed to boost. This is not modern; it is medieval and is rooted in extraction, exploitation and a fantasy that Europe can outsource environmental damage without moral consequence. I urge Government Members to reject this deal here in Ireland and at European level and to negotiate with their EU counterparts to stop this disastrous deal in its tracks. The EU's integrity demands it, Irish farming families demand it and our climate obligations demand it too."

                "I welcome this Private Members' motion brought forward by Sinn Féin and confirm my support for it. The Mercosur deal threatens the future of Irish agriculture and family farms and harms rural communities. The European Commission concluded negotiations with the four Mercosur countries, Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, in December 2024. The deal was to be subject to approval by national parliaments and unanimity at EU level but in a political stroke, the deal was split into two separate parts, meaning that national parliaments will now have no say in the ratification of the agreement and only a qualified majority will be needed at EU level. The importation of 99,000 tonnes of beef and 180,000 tonnes of poultry into the EU will have serious detrimental effects on Irish agriculture and these figures are surely only the thin end of the wedge. This is also at odds with EU and domestic climate legislation.",
                "To aid the ratification of the deal, the EU has also delayed the implementation of the deforestation Regulation 2023/1115. Imported agricultural products from Mercosur countries are also often produced using chemicals that have been banned in the EU. An EU audit of 2024 showed that Brazil, for example, cannot reliably trace or guarantee hormone-free beef, yet the agreement will allow exporters to self-certify compliance with EU regulations. Of course, we in this country know where self-certification and light-touch regulations have got us - buildings and apartments non-compliant with fire regulations and the scandal of defective concrete.",
                "The bilateral safeguard proposed by the EU only applies for a transitional period of 12 years and the weakness of the system, when it comes to protecting Irish farmers, is very clear. The triggering mechanism for the bilateral safeguard does not apply to situations of risk to public health, environmental destruction or indigenous dispossession. The Mercosur trade agreement would also undermine our food security objectives and threaten generational renewal. The deal, in my view, trades off the future of Irish agriculture and rural communities for the benefit of the export of cars, machinery, chemicals and steel to the Mercosur countries by big European economies. This is further confirmation and indication of the erosion of Irish sovereignty.",
                "The Irish Farmers Association says it cannot countenance a deal that refuses to recognise the gap in standards between the EU and Brazil and is concerned about lower standards of traceability of Brazilian beef production and the use of hormones. In a recent concession to attempt to offset these concerns, the Commission has proposed a mechanism whereby preferential Mercosur access for farm produce could be suspended if the imported market share or volume rose by 10% or prices fell by a similar figure. Mr. Francie Gorman, the IFA president, has said:",
                "Regrettably it is very difficult to see how this so-called safeguard will be of any help. It requires there to be a threat of 'serious injury' to the sector before an investigation is even launched.",
                "He also said this is \"a very high bar\" and went on to say:",
                "This safeguard clause allows for the gradual destruction of the EU beef and poultry markets as this deal is phased in. It is just a political fig leaf.",
                "The MEP Luke 'Ming' Flanagan draws attention to another difficulty. He says trust in European institutions and in their ability to manage trade partnerships has been damaged by the war in Gaza.

In the summer of 2024, when the political machines were flying around this country, the promises to all of the farming organisations, farmers and voters that Mercosur would be opposed were plenty. In November, it was said again. I was looking at the programme for Government again this evening. It stated that the Government would \"work with like-minded EU countries to stand up for Irish farmers and defend our interests in opposing the current Mercosur trade deal.\" What I have heard tonight is like a fella sitting on the fence and a fella who is going to fall into Ursula von der Leyen's side of the field, not into the side of farmers right around the country. It was astonishing to hear a Minister for agriculture basically say we will look at this, that and the other. Do not give a promise a year ago that the Government will do something if it is not going to deliver it. Do not fool the people around this country and in the agricultural sector if it will not deliver what it said it would.",
                "Tonight, Deputy Martin Kenny and all of the representatives in agriculture had a meeting with the Polish committee on agriculture. They are fully opposed to Mercosur. They will work with us. In the committee, we are trying to build relationships. We are going to talk to the French, the Austrians and the Italians. This work on the Mercosur deal should have been done by our Minister already to build relationships everywhere. The Polish are completely opposed to it, so we have allies if we want to use them, or do we have the towel thrown in, with the secret deal done behind the scenes?",
                "In the last couple of weeks, we heard the Commissioner talk. The Commissioner was in Ireland and stated very clearly, in committee room two, that if cattle or beef prices dropped 6%, 7%, 8% or 9% per year, the handbrake would not come on. During the week you would not know if it is the cable that is gone in the handbrake with the way it is now. They will not give a yes-no answer because they are muddying the water and leaving farmers not knowing what the terms and conditions are. The fact is that if prices do not drop by more than 10%, farmers are in trouble. That has not changed.",
                "This is a grubby deal for the simple reason that it has been split in Europe so that there will be no vote in this Parliament here. We can blame someone else and say they did that abroad in Europe. I welcome Ciaran Mullooly and the rest of the MEPs such as Michael McNamara, who have gone to the courts to try to do something. I am not a believer in the European Court of Justice, ECJ, because I think it is a kangaroo court and I do not think we will get what we deserve out of that.",
                "Our MEPs need to build relationships, our Government needs to build relationships and we on the agriculture committee will build relationships that are as good as possible. However, at the end of the day, this will be sorted in the Council of Ministers. If the Government has the liarthróidí, do not be afraid to be on the other side of the fence. Do not be afraid to say you do not agree with what the EU is doing and you are opposing it, and let others stand up with you. The simple reason is that there will be 7 million more cattle from now to 2033 in Brazil. As has been brought up - I welcome this point as well - the poultry sector in Ireland will be decimated by this deal. There is also the issue of traceability and hormones.",
                "We all know what is going on. They built a road through the rainforest for COP30 and these are the people who will be saving the world. The Minister and the Government have to make a decision. Last year, they assured the Irish people, not alone during the summer but before the election as well. Plenty of politicians who are elected here met the farming organisations right around their constituencies and guaranteed them that there was no way they would let this deal through. Sadly, tonight I am a bit hoarser than I was a year ago. Some of us have stood by this. This Government needs to stand up for the Irish farming sector and be counted. If it does not do that, it will not be tomorrow or next year or the year after that we will see the results. It will be in nine and ten years' time that the farmers of Ireland will suffer for this."

                "I welcome the farming organisations who are represented in the Gallery today. It is the third time they have been here in the Dáil during the past week fighting for the survival of their members. I thank Sinn Féin for this motion on the Mercosur trade agreement, an issue that goes to the heart of Ireland's rural economy, our food standards and our environmental commitments. This deal as it stands poses a serious threat to Irish farming. It would open the door to 99,000 tonnes of South American beef entering the EU market every year, produced under conditions that fall far short of the standard we demand here. Growth hormones that are banned in Europe are still widely used in Brazil. There is no EU inspection system on the ground and past experience shows that meat cleared by Brazilian authorities has failed EU safety tests. Irish farmers have built a reputation for quality, traceability and sustainability. That reputation is not just a market slogan; it is a foundation of rural livelihoods. Yet, this deal risks flooding the market with beef at €3.50 per kilo compared with €9 or €10 for quality Irish beef. How can our farmers compete with that?",
                "It is not just beef. Dairy exports, which some claim will benefit, will face the same reality. Mercosur dairy products are up to 40% cheaper than ours. The promised opportunities are, frankly, wishful thinking. We are told there will be safeguards but let us look at the facts. The proposed €1 billion safety net for farmers has been dropped. The environmental and human rights clauses sound good on paper but enforcement has been weak in other trade deals. These are not real protections; they are political cover.",
                "This is why voices like Ciaran Mullooly, our Midlands-North-West MEP, have been campaigning tirelessly in Brussels to block this agreement. He has warned that this is not just an economic issue; it is a question of food safety, climate responsibility and fairness. Ciaran has built alliances with farming groups and secured commitments from France to oppose the deal. Ireland must do the same. The Government promised to oppose Mercosur. Tonight, we need to reaffirm that commitment. I am worried when I do not see agriculture Ministers across from us here showing the interest they should. We need our Government to stand up and make sure this will not stand. This Government needs to back Irish farmers, the people who put food on the table. Ireland must make its position crystal clear. This deal is unacceptable. Silence is not an option. This is a defining moment. Do we stand with our farmers, our rural communities and our environmental obligations or do we sign away those values for a deal that benefits others at our expense?",
                "In rural Ireland, agriculture is not just an industry; it is a way of life. Up here in Dublin, some may not fully grasp that reality. We know the hard work it takes to run a farm. We know the dedication it takes to keep that farm alive. We know what it means when fathers and mothers dream of passing that land onto their children. Farming is not a job; it is in the blood, but our farmers are exhausted. They are buried under paperwork, strangled by bureaucracy and squeezed by regulations on nitrates. Now, if this Mercosur deal goes ahead, it will be the wipe-out of Irish farming. I urge the House to reject this agreement and to send a strong message to Brussels: Ireland will not sacrifice its standards, its farmers or its future"

Last week, the Climate Change Advisory Council of Ireland outlined that if we continue on our current trajectory around carbon emissions, this country will face up to €26 billion of fines by 2030. It is an incredible sum of money - €26 billion. At the same time that our European institutions, and indeed our Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Governments, have signed us up to these fines, they are also about to sign us up to the Mercosur trade deal, which will see 99,000 tonnes of beef from Europe, deforestation across Latin America and the importation of substandard beef at a carbon cost of three to six times that of Irish beef.",
                "How does that make sense? How does it make sense that we will pay up to €26 billion in fines by 2030?",
                "On the other hand, we are going to sign this trade deal, which will have a devastating impact for our climate. Who is this going to benefit? We have some of the best beef in the world, with some of the strictest and toughest environmental standards, and standards right across our food sector. The beef that we are going to import is a verifiable health risk, with 17-beta-estradiol, a growth hormone that is widely found and widely used in cattle production in the Mercosur countries. It is classified as a carcinogenic. The use of hormones is completely banned across Europe. It is completely banned in Ireland, yet we want to import this into Ireland and right across the European Union. We have seen these double standards not just in this beef deal but also in the tillage sector, which knows all too well about this. The fact is that genetically modified grain is coming into Ireland and the European Union and is competing with Irish native grain, and yet we cannot engage in that. How does that make sense?",
                "I sat in the committee this evening and we spoke to our Polish counterparts. We are working to try and build alliance across the European Union, but that is what the Government should be doing here. It is what the Minister for agriculture should be doing. I think we do have support in that regard. We saw the electioneering that went on at the ploughing championships and at agricultural shows across the country before the general election. All of those commitments seem to be forgotten. The language this evening was incredibly vague. That is absolutely and totally disappointing. In terms of the safeguards, I think it is well documented now that there are no safeguards and that the beef price can actually fall by 9% over five years without any safeguards being implemented. It will cost the farming sector across Ireland up to €130 million. It is time for the Government to get off the fence and either come down with the farmers or come down on the side of Mercosur. It is time-----"

That means Ireland cannot rely on an imagined veto. We need clarity, conviction and a firm defence of Irish farmers. Fianna Fáil welcomes this debate but let me be very clear: unless this agreement contains real enforcement protections, Ireland cannot and should not support the Mercosur package. Barry Cowen MEP has done detailed and difficult work on this. He met privately with the DG AGRI officials, who design and enforce the safeguard mechanism. What he brought back matters deeply to the farmers across Louth and the north east and all across the country. The Commission has now confirmed that the 10% threshold is not a hard trigger, that the 7% to 9% rise in imports or fall in prices already counts as a market injury, that provisional safeguards can be imposed in 21 days, that a member state's requests must be answered within five working days and that investigations must conclude within four months, not 12.",
                "These improvements are direct results of Irish pressure, but they do not change the basic reality that 99,000 tonnes of beef quota has real consequences for real farms. In Collon, Ardee, Dunleer, the Cooley Peninsula, Castlebellingham and all across the Boyne Valley, farmers are operating on razor-thin margins and cannot absorb the price collapse driven by lower standard imports. That leads to a central issue of trust. If farmers cannot trust their own Department, they are not going to trust Brussels. The recent handling of the sheep welfare scheme proves that point. Farmers were told they would receive €13 per ewe. They planned around it and they budgeted for it. Then the Department cut it to €11.50. This is not a minor tweak. It is a disgrace. When the State moves the goalposts after farmers have already committed, how can any anyone realistically expect them to have confidence in a European safeguard system affecting their livelihoods? If this is how the Department operates a domestic scheme, why should farmers trust them-----"

We recognise the export opportunities in services, engineering and life sciences but not at the cost of the farmers in the north east or anywhere else. The programme for Government is explicit: Ireland will stand by like-minded EU countries to defend our farmers and oppose any Mercosur agreement that does not deliver binding commitments on climate, biodiversity, deforestation and fair product standards. That remains our position. Farmers want honesty, consistency and a Government that keeps its word. Fianna Fáil will continue to fight for exactly that because rural Ireland cannot be asked to carry the risk of trade while trust at home has already been undermined."

I am delighted to get the opportunity to speak on an issue that lies at the heart of our rural communities, the Mercosur trade agreement, and how we are going to ensure the protection of Irish farmers. As everybody in this room knows, farming is not just a job; it is a way of life for many in Ireland. Our farmers work tirelessly to produce high-quality food while adhering to the highest environmental and animal welfare standards. However, the proposed Mercosur deal raises significant concerns about how it could impact their livelihoods. While we recognise the potential economic opportunities that could arise from opening new markets, we have to be clear that our farmers cannot bear the weight of this agreement if it puts their livelihoods at risk. This is a non-negotiable. The prospect of increased imports of cheaper agricultural products from South America could drive down prices and threaten the sustainability of our farms. We have to advocate, in particular at LEADER level at this stage, for strong safeguards, higher standards, compensation and support, and transparency and consultation.",

As we navigate the complexities of international trade, let us ensure that any agreements made serve to strengthen, not weaken, our agricultural sector."

                "Whatever way you slice it, this Mercosur madness is a disastrous deal for Ireland and I remain strongly opposed to it. If it is pushed through and ratified by a qualified majority, then the EU Commission will have very clearly signalled its contempt not just for the sovereignty of this Parliament but for the livelihoods of the farmers that it will destroy. Far from being our ally and our friend, this Commission has demonstrated a willingness to smother our rural economy in its sleep. It simply does not care what the outcomes are for Ireland. It is, quite literally, a poisonous deal as we know that South American meat often uses growth-promoting hormones and antibiotics that are banned in the EU, potentially increasing carcinogenic risks for Irish consumers. The arguments against this deal have been rehearsed so many times. In fact, the deal has managed to unite farmers and environmentalists in their opposition to it, but for very different reasons. There is no doubt whatsoever that Ireland stands to lose out disproportionately due to our reliance on high-value, standards compliance farming. The critical issues have not been mitigated despite our clear warnings to the EU Commission. Some of the those warnings include the deal allowing for 99,000 tonnes of tariff-free beef primarily from Brazil and Argentina, not just as a once-off but annually, undercutting Irish farmers' prices amid current high market values and threatening our sector viability. What we need here is a commitment from the Government. The Government must stand with our farming community. This deal must be opposed and a message of strong opposition has to be sent to the EU Commission now. The Government needs to get off the fence and stand with our farmers."

Successive Governments have not shown good faith to farmers for a long time.

I was astonished to think we had a Judas in the camp. When it came to the Social Democrats, they went totally against the cause we have here. Ní neart go cur le chéile is a good speech from me. Stand together united. Then, lo and behold, who had a seat at the table? It was An Taisce. When the Minister brought the Commissioner to that table and the Minister of State, Deputy Healy-Rae, was there as well, what happened? The brave boyos from An Taisce insisted that the Minister and Minister of State leave the table and they had their own conversation with the Commissioner. We would not have to guess or to be a genius to find out what they said and what they told her. We have an NGO here, overpaid fat cats, who are destroying rural Ireland. They are destroying families trying to get planning permission. They are anti-farmer. We saw what happened in the court case in Kilkenny in the constituency of Deputy Cleere and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle with the Glanbia plant. It took it to the High Court with taxpayers' money. We have to get our house in order. Cut out the NGOs. Cut out those traitors who are destroying our country here and not supporting us, and then have a Government and all parties and none standing up for the farmers.",

We do not have to have those NGOs at meetings like that last week. An Taisce - I will name it here again - would not allow the Minister or Minister of State hear what it was saying because it was talking us down. It was damaging farmers and trying to blame farmers for the pollution that was happening by Uisce Éireann, county councils and industry. We had pollution in Cork and nobody was responsible. If it was a farmer, it would be all over the papers and everything else. It is time that we were fair here to rural Ireland, to young farmers and old farmers alike. Stand with the farmers. Get rid of An Taisce and all of the other bodies that are melting us here, soaking us and destroying us in Europe and elsewhere."

Good and very good stock people were forced into dairying in this country and we are going to see worse than that. How can anybody, when we are net contributors to the EU, see what is happening out there and allow this beef to come in? Then we are told that if it suffers more than 10%, we will get a refund. Farmers do not want a refund. They want to get paid for the job that they do. None of them wants to get money in the post. We want to be allowed to produce beef, get a market value for it and just make a week's wages. That is all we want. Unless people like every one of us in the Dáil Chamber oppose this Mercosur deal, we are going to see farmers being wiped out of the beef industry. We will have nothing left in the country. The tillage farmers are on their knees at the moment. I beg the Government to give them money. Now, we will see the beef industry going and there will be nothing left only the dairy industry, and that is not good practice for farming."

                "I acknowledge the Deputies who tabled the motion and the genuine debate we have had here this evening. The Government recognises the real depth of concern surrounding the proposed EU Mercosur agreement. In particular, those concerns relate to Irish agriculture and our rural economy as well as the importance of ensuring sustainable adequate environmental protections. For these reasons, and in acknowledgement of the very important points that have been raised here this evening, the Government does not oppose the motion and I fully support that.",
                "Personally, I am very familiar with the various iterations of EU Mercosur agreements, having spent 15 years in the European Parliament, and I opposed the various proposals put forward over many years on a number of grounds. These ranged from the potentially negative effects on the Irish beef trade to the destruction of part of the Amazon forest as well as, of course, crucially highlighting different production standards alongside the issue of compliance with sanitary and phytosanitary requirements. This is why my Independent colleagues and I, when we signed up to the programme for Government, insisted that the Government oppose the current deal. In this regard, I want to quote exactly what the programme for Government states. It states the Government commits to \"Work with like-minded EU countries to stand up for Irish farmers and defend our interests in opposing the current Mercosur trade deal.\" Those listening to the contribution of the Minister, Deputy Heydon, at the beginning of the debate will have heard him say the Departments of foreign affairs and agriculture were continuing to examine the proposals in detail and would continue to engage with the European Commission to ensure Ireland's concerns were fully taken on board.",
                "However, he goes on to say that, pending that examination and the completion of the ongoing engagement, Ireland's position on the EU Mercosur agreement remains as clearly outlined in the programme for Government, which is, I reiterate, to work \"with like-minded countries to stand up for Irish farmers and defend our interests in opposing the current Mercosur deal.\" I fully support this position and recognise and applaud the efforts of the Minister for agriculture and our Tánaiste in defending that position. Just yesterday, the Minister held bilateral meetings on the margins of the Council meeting with our Italian and French counterparts.",
                "If this agreement were to be adopted, it would require a qualified majority vote in the Council and a simple majority vote in the European Parliament. We can see this process is ongoing. I say again that Ireland is committed to implementing what is in the programme for Government. That is what the Minister, Deputy Heydon, said and I am happy to reiterate it as a representative of the Independent group in Government.",
                "Some Deputies have complained loudly about other Deputies not being here. That is a cheap shot and we all know it. I am here to represent those Deputies. Looking around, some of the Deputies who complained are no longer with us.",
                "As mentioned by the Minister, Deputy Heydon, the broader international trade context is also important for Ireland. Trade and our international partnerships have always been fundamental to our economic model. Within that framework, we continue to advocate for solutions that are fair, sustainable and reflective of our values. That is both for Ireland and our EU trading partners.",
                "Ireland has long championed free, fair and open trade. This has been central to our economic model and our farming community would absolutely support that position. Our EU membership connects us to a growing network of best-in-class free trade agreements, which support jobs, facilitate investment and uphold stringent EU standards in food safety, plant and animal health. They also advance environmental and human rights protections globally. We know that trade is essential to securing prosperity, sustaining employment and attracting investment. When new agreements are balanced and fair, it is in Ireland's interest to ratify them swiftly but, as emphasised by the Minister, Deputy Heydon, balance is always key. That remains central to the Government's approach.",
                "The European Commission presented its final package on 3 September. Ireland repeatedly raised our concerns about climate, biodiversity and deforestation, as well as the need for strong protections and assurances for the incomes of Irish farmers. We have always been clear that such agreements must defend our most vulnerable sectors and that farmers' livelihoods must not be undermined through weak or ineffective environmental standards in other countries. As I said, this position is clearly outlined in the programme for Government, which we signed up to. I will again repeat that it states that Ireland will \"Work with like-minded EU countries to stand up for Irish farmers and defend our interests in opposing the current Mercosur deal.\" That has not changed. I am happy to say that here today.",
                "I assure the Dáil that the Government, including the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and other Ministers, as well as officials, have continued to engage actively at EU level with both the European Commission and counterparts in member states, including like-minded countries, to voice our concerns and interrogate the outcomes of these negotiations. This engagement has been essential in assessing whether the agreement adequately addresses Ireland's priorities and to our efforts to negotiate more favourable outcomes. In terms of the overall package, it is important to say that this engagement is ongoing.",
                "Any reasonable observer will agree that the Irish Government has worked strongly and assiduously to build and be part of that blocking minority. The Tánaiste and the Minister for agriculture had many discussions with like-minded countries in recent months. Those discussions continue. It is also important to say that for Ireland, there would be significant opportunities in software and telecoms services, financial services, engineering, life services, food and beverages and education. However, serious concerns remain about agriculture. They are crucial for me. Once again, I come back to what we committed to in the programme for Government.",
                "This agreement has dealt with many of the issues raised by some of my colleagues about labour rights, sustainable production, women's economic empowerment and more. Crucially, the Paris Agreement would become an essential element of the deal, enforceable through dispute settlement and allowing for the suspension of the agreement in cases of serious breach. In that spirit, the Government will continue to engage constructively and assiduously with other member states and the Commission in the following weeks as we seek to ensure the best possible outcome for Ireland in the final vote."

If the Mercosur deal is ratified by the European Union, it will sound the death knell for thousands of farmers in Ireland and across the European Union. The European Union's mission statement is to promote the well-being of its citizens by providing freedom, security and justice. This deal is contrary to these principles. Freedom is democracy. Democracy is not being served here. The deliberate splitting of the deal into two takes away the majority vote, thus undermining the process of natural law. Changing the deal from an associate agreement to a partnership one is underhanded, deceitful and a betrayal of the Irish farmers. The importation of 99,000 tonnes of beef and 180,000 tonnes of poultry will wipe away financial security from every family farm in Ireland. It will result in huge losses of income and undermine the prospects and any ambitions of young people to continue farming into the future.",
                "The people of Ireland are not naïve. They know this imported beef and poultry will not be subject to the same high standard as the Irish produce, bringing with it a high risk of banned pesticides, hormones and antibiotics being used and entering our food chain. There is a real possibility of long-term health problems down the line. This is why this deal must be scrapped. This deal is being done with one of the biggest beef barons in the world, JBS, which has been trading on the New York Stock Exchange since June of this year. Coincidentally, it also contributed over $5 million to the Trump presidential campaign. Over 75,000 ha of rainforest has been cleared this year alone. Deforestation is not only destroying the Earth's natural resources of oxygen but also trampling on the human rights of the indigenous people of that area, with some paying with their lives.",

I have met with farmers from across Wicklow and Wexford on many occasions. I welcome those who are here tonight. Not one of them supports this deal, which is absolutely wrong on every level and which will sound the death knell for Irish agriculture. The Government's response to date has been lacklustre.

They do exactly what is often asked of them. What they expect in return is a Government that puts in place a framework that they can work within. Successive Governments have failed to live up to their part of that agreement. It sometimes seems that farming families in Ireland are bearing witness to a national conversation as to whether their livelihood should be culled. This Government was party to trade negotiations which would see their produce replaced with a lower-quality South American alternative. Assurances offered by successive Ministers were not worth the paper they were written on. The so-called safeguard that emerged has been welcomed or endorsed by virtually no one. This deal will see upwards of 100,000 tonnes of beef and 180,000 tonnes of poultry flood the European market. That produce will not be produced to Irish standards in the context of the use of pesticides, hormones or antibiotics.

Those who did the cows for cars deal do not care about the programme for Government. This deal is completely incompatible with our commitments under the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5°C, a target we are already set to miss. It will significantly boost trade in goods that have a high environmental impact, such as soya, poultry and, in particular, beef, and contribute to widespread deforestation. Between 2001 and 2020, the Amazon rainforest decreased in size by over 54.2 million ha and lost almost 90% of its trees. That is an area the size of France. The Taoiseach made a virtue out of attending COP30, which is taking place in the home of the Amazon rainforest, to show other leaders how seriously Ireland is taking climate action. We cannot call for climate action and biodiversity protection at COP30 one week and wave through rainforest destruction the following week, all for the sake of a pat on the head from German car manufacturers.",

The Mercosur deal is not about trade; it is about agricultural vandalism."

To ensure that the tunnel can continue to fulfil its core purpose, a €1 increase in that toll that applies to southbound traffic in the morning was deemed appropriate. Tolls on the tunnel at other times remain unchanged.",

It also important to say that the toll by-laws for each individual road set out the basis for calculating maximum tolls each year. The maximum tolls are calculated for each vehicle category and TII, which is responsible for collecting the toll, calculates the maximum tolls for the Dublin tunnel and the M50 and decides the actual tolls that should apply. The PPP companies calculate the maximum tolls for the eight PPP concessions and propose the actual tolls that should apply. The mechanism for these calculations is set out in the by-laws.

I have no doubt he will join me in welcoming this initiative, which was launched in September and extends free travel on all public service obligation, PSO, services to children between five and eight years of age. This initiative was announced as part of the budget 2025 package of measures and delivers on a key programme for Government commitment to make public transport more affordable and accessible for families. The extension of free travel for children under nine builds on the 2017 introduction of free travel for children under five on subsidised public transport services.",

While some concerns were raised about the practicality of applying for a card for each child, this requirement is necessary for several reasons: children may travel alone or with different adults; and current validator technology does not permit multiple taps of the same card within a short timeframe, which prevents accidental double-charging. The Leap system, introduced in 2011, is now a legacy platform and cannot support new features such as multiple identities on one card. Individual cards also allow operators and the NTA to monitor usage, providing valuable data on the success of the scheme in promoting public transport usage. The child Leap card expires at the end of the month in which the child turns nine, after which they transition to a child Leap card offering a 67% discount on adult fares. These measures, along with the NTA's recent fare zone adjustments, aim to make public transport more equitable, inclusive and affordable for young people."

However, the roll-out has not been going to plan. First of all, it took about a year to get it off the ground and the scheme was not officially launched until September. Even worse, some of the cards required to access the scheme do not work. Parents have contacted us to say not only does their child's Leap card not work but many bus drivers had not heard of the scheme. That is hardly a ringing endorsement of a successful roll-out. The NTA has confirmed to us there are problems with the scheme and has claimed the issues will be resolved when a fix is found and proper testing carried out. How is the Minister of State planning to do that? Why was this situation not anticipated and dealt with before September?"

At a recent appearance at the transport committee, David Conway from the Coach Tourism and Transport Council of Ireland said his operators are excluded from the scheme. He found that surprising given they are included with some other elements. Our heavy reliance on commercial transport operators in rural areas is maintained because public transport has not been expanded over the years as it should have been. As a result of this failure and lack of planning, some parents and children have no choice but to use a commercial operator. They were included in the young adult fare scheme but have not been included in this. That is the call from that organisation and from many people in rural Ireland who are obliged to use the commercial operators."

While the NTA is responsible for licensing commercial bus services, any decisions regarding fares charged by these services are managed by commercial bus operators themselves, who largely operate without State subvention. Notably, the young adult card scheme was broadened three years ago to include eligible services operated by commercial bus operators on an opt-in basis, with individual operators choosing to participate and the NTA compensating them for the agreed discount. We must encourage and provide for the continuation of public transport for people in rural areas, in particular.

Many other technical requirements are needed. It is important, especially when you consider the devastation caused by an accident. We have only to look at what happened last weekend in Louth. I sympathise with all the families there. To have such a devastating incident and collision and to see five lives just disappear is profoundly sad for all the families and communities. An e-scooter is a vehicle and a machine. It is important we make sure people are safe on them."

There are concerns about visibility for other road users. As the Minister of State said, there are also concerns about footpaths being used to facilitate e-scooters, all of which is illegal. The introduction of a regime with registration or insurance requirements would make sure the user would have accountability.",

I would love to work with the Minister of State and other Ministers to bring forward a regulatory regime that would bring that accountability to the use of e-scooters while maintaining their safe use for convenience."

However, I believe there is a huge lack of understanding of what an e-scooter can do, the power it has and the speed it can go at. We have the regulations and there is an enforcement issue there. I see on the roads people on these scooters without a high-visibility vest, helmet or protection and sometimes without lights. I ask how these people are on the roads and not being taken in. It is an issue. It is a growing problem and I will be looking at it. Road safety and the prevention of accidents and near misses is important. We have to make the road safe for everyone."

I look forward to seeing its introduction as part of BusConnects Dublin before ultimately being delivered across the entire public transport network. Many people have seen contactless ticketing systems in other countries and feel like it is taking a long time to deliver here. As I have previously explained, which was in the reply to another question I did not have to answer, we introduced the new Leap ticketing system as the financial crisis took hold and investment in updated ticketing technology was held back. The good news is that we now have the funding available to make the move to new ticketing technology and the National Transport Authority, NTA, has entered into a contract with Indra to deliver the project.",

This is a major, complex project, with an estimated capital cost of over €160 million to implement it in the greater Dublin area alone. Phase 1 is due to launch in September 2027. It will test contactless payment on a number of new validators or ticket machines. Phase 2 will be ready in summer 2028, allowing passengers on Dublin's bus and Luas services to use the next generation ticketing technology, including contactless payments on validators. Plans for phases 3 and 4 remain under development at the moment.",

As the Minister of State said, many other countries have had contactless payment options rolled out for years. However, we are still waiting for a trial run for the Dublin bus network, never mind elsewhere in the State. It is reflective of the wider failure of the current and previous Governments to keep up with technological advances. Another example of this is that TFI currently has five different smartphone apps for different public transport services, including a journey planner app, a Leap card top-up app, a taxi driver database app, an app for public transport tickets and an app for local services in certain parts of the State. Clearly, there is a need to amalgamate some of these apps to make getting public transport a more user-friendly and accessible experience. Are there are any plans to streamline these apps? Does the Minister of State intend to engage with the NTA on this?"

It is important to note that it is not just a matter of giving somebody a card or going contactless. This is next generation ticketing and it will be used for a good number of years. It is not like a Leap card system, which is very simple. It is important to make sure that whatever we use is fit for purpose and is tested before it is rolled out fully.

The Department of Transport is progressing the preparatory work necessary to establish a Dublin-Derry public service obligation air service in 2026. This service will enhance connectivity for the north west of the island pending progress on an upgrade to the A5 road transport corridor by the Executive, to which the Government has made a €600 million funding commitment.",

The Minister, Deputy O'Brien, has met representatives of Donegal County Council, Derry City and Strabane District Council and City of Derry Airport, where progress on the establishment of this service was discussed. Officials from the Department of Transport are engaging closely with the Department for the Economy in the North, the Department for Transport in the United Kingdom and City of Derry Airport, as well as with the European Commission in relation to any potential state aid implications and obligations. This close engagement will continue over the coming months.",

This exercise will seek views on the specification required to meet expected demand for the service in terms of aircraft capacity, fare structures, frequency and timing of services. It is also expected that this engagement will confirm the interest in and recognised benefits of the PSO air service for stakeholders in Derry and the wider north-west region. As Deputy Mac Lochlainn will know, following this, it is anticipated that a tender for the PSO air service will be published by the Department of Transport early next year, with a view to services commencing by October 2026, or earlier if operationally feasible.",

I assure him that the current timetable is the optimal timeline to ensure that the detailed work required to establish a service on this route can be completed so that a new service can be launched successfully. As he knows, the shared island fund is committed to this. I look forward to working with the Deputy and the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, on delivering services for the people of the north west."

We should compliment the wonderful Local Link service in Donegal. The Deputy right. I will bring his comments back to the Department officials. I assure him that the current timeline proposed is the optimum one to ensure that important stakeholder engagement and the preparatory work are completed and we can deliver this important service. He is right that we share this. It is an important service that needs to be delivered. It would provide subsidised transport connectivity for the people of Derry and, by extension, Donegal, particularly north-east Donegal. It would also complement the Donegal and Dublin PSO air service which serves the western region of Donegal well. It is important that we have joined-up connectivity for the north west. It will improve transport connectivity. I concur with the Deputy that it is necessary.",

The strategy puts great importance on engagement with disabled people.",

I have also met them. The Minister and I welcomed the opportunity to hear views on transport accessibility and the pillar 5 actions at the start of the new strategy. It was a valuable and rewarding exchange with disabled persons organisations, service providers, disability user groups and board representatives from transport operators. I believe that only by engaging with those who have lived experience of disability can we truly remove the barriers they face daily. I commend Ciarán Delaney from Cork, who has briefed me extensively on this very important issue.",

As Deputy Ó Muirí will know, there are three aspects to improving public transport accessibility: ensuring a universal design approach in all new infrastructure, addressing legacy infrastructure deficits and enabling independent travel. We have an ambitious programme of investment planned for the next five years, all of which will adhere to the principles of universal design and, therefore, help deliver a more inclusive transport network in the years ahead. The real challenge is legacy infrastructure. To give an example, the major accessibility upgrade which opened at Athy station on 4 November was funded from this programme. The Minister has increased funding under the accessibility retrofit programme by 67% this year when compared to last year. We will maintain that increased level of funding under the new NDP."

How is this accessible for elderly commuters? If people are heading back to the northside, there is now no stop between Ormond Quay and Eden Quay, which is a distance of nearly 1 km. How is this accessible for elderly commuters? For citizens with mobility challenges, this is a very serious barrier to accessing the north city centre."

The benefits to the city and the wider Dublin area, all the way from the suburbs into the city centre and beyond, are enormous. However, there is still some way to go. To go back to the 73 service, buses are bunching, with two or three buses in a row and then no bus coming for 30 to 40 minutes. Again, senior citizens are left standing. The bus stop on Eden Quay does not actually show on the stop that it is the 73 service, although it shows 73 bunched on the digital display. Older citizens are unhappy using the new stops on Gardiner Street because, to be honest, they just do not feel safe after dark. While I welcome the overall thrust of BusConnects, the NTA has to look at these issues. I appreciate the Minister of State's offer to bring the issues back. I ask him to do that so the NTA can respond and actively listen to citizens, in particular older citizens who use that service every day."

Like her, I am eager to see improvements in real-time tracking, not just of Dublin Bus services, but nationwide across the whole public service obligation, PSO, fleet. The Dublin Bus automatic vehicle location system feeds information to the bus operator's control room, TFI Live app and on-street signs. It dates from 2009. A new automatic vehicle location system is due to be rolled out initially on Dublin Bus and Go-Ahead Ireland Dublin city buses. I expect this will lead to significant performance improvements and improved quality of information for bus passengers.",

As the system is very large and complex, this activity will continue and will be repeated as necessary until the NTA is satisfied that features work as intended and that all major defects are resolved, in order for the NTA to be confident that the solution is fully functional and sufficiently robust to be installed on buses. Subject to the systems successfully passing the detailed testing phases that are under way, a pilot implementation is scheduled to commence early next year. Assuming no issues are found during the pilot, full roll-out on buses in Dublin and other cities will commence next year. The roll-out should be complete in early 2027. In total, approximately 1,800 buses nationwide will have to have the new system installed on them. This is part of a wider effort to update vehicle tracking infrastructure across the PSO fleet and to improve public bus systems through BusConnects in our cities, which will improve both the accessibility and reliability of our bus system, particularly through the construction of core bus corridors."

Since then, I have had a commitment that €700,000 will be spent in 2025 on addressing capacity and punctuality issues on routes 39A, 37 and 38. I had previous commitments here about route 70.

Apparently, there are six technical staff working collaboratively with a similar number of personnel from the transport operator. They are in regular contact. I would like to know what improvements have been made in 2025 regarding the communication of cancelled services. There is no point saying the system works well, which I hear in responses to my parliamentary questions, and that most people find it very useful if it leaves customers stranded on the side of the road expecting a bus when none is coming, with no explanation or apology. Sometimes, it is the last bus due that does not turn up, which is unacceptable when travelling alone and in the dark. So many young people contact me to say this is the case. It should be a simple ask to tell passengers if a service is not running, not just in the automatic vehicle location system but also in the current system."

Operational decisions regarding service delivery are the responsibility of the NTA in collaboration with transport operators, subject to funding and resource availability. I will happily sit down with the Deputy and talk to him again about this because it is important that we enhance connectivity, do not discommode people further and allow people the convenience of transport connectivity and accessibility. As the Deputy knows quite well, post-budget discussions around the allocation of funding for the PSO programme are ongoing. It entails regular engagement between the NTA and operators on resource needs. I am acutely aware of the issues the Deputy has raised with me both here in the House and in private, and I will certainly work with him to ensure a service between Carnew and Baltinglass so the people of Baltinglass will not be discommoded further.",

Like her, I am eager to see best practice being implemented across our public transport sector, including passenger technology. As we heard from Deputy O’Connell and from Deputy Currie earlier, it is a very important matter. Public transport apps are not simply about having a technological solution for the sake of it. Rather, they are about having information available to people so that they can make the best use of our public transport system, especially those who may be new to it or have difficulty finding the best way of making their journey. It is also about having the confidence and that piece around reliability.",

As an example, the NTA has worked closely with Transport for Scotland on a redesign of TFI Live. Unfortunately, progress has been slower than anticipated because of a lack of mobile application development capacity with the source supplier. While the TFI Live application does function and does present journey planning and real-time data to customers, the NTA is currently investigating options to expedite improvements to the application to improve the customer experience.",
                    "One project that will produce improved quality journey data to the TFI Live app is next generation automatic vehicle location, AVL, which replaces five old automatic vehicle location systems with a new centralised solution, to provide higher quality and consistent data outputs to the TFI Live mobile app. This project is going to pilot in March 2026, with the full roll-out taking approximately 12-18 months, which I look forward to seeing happening. I will conclude by saying that people often express their frustration to me about the performance of the app. It is something we need to improve on and work with Members of the House to see this delivered."

Deputy Currie also highlighted the issue of ghost buses and the unreliability of the app. Deputy Timmins also highlighted this issue as well. It is also very frustrating that there is not one single accessible platform. There are effectively five different apps that people might find themselves having to interact with to plan their journey. There is the journey planner, a taxi driver database and the Leap top-up. It is really extraordinarily complicated, particularly for someone who is new to it or not digitally savvy, for whatever reason. Addressing this type of issue really needs to be important if we are going to encourage people to rely on public transport and give up their car and move to public transport. Even if it is only part of their journey and they do use other forms of transportation, if that part of the journey becomes unreliable, and people cannot rely on or navigate the apps, all of these things will be barriers to trying to get these transformations and modal shifts."

The NTA has responsibility for the planning and development of public transport infrastructure, including the development of the related technological systems. As I said earlier, the NTA has awarded a contract to implement and support a national automatic vehicle location system for all public service obligation buses to Trapeze, which is a specialist transport systems company. It is envisaged the work being done will enable the NTA to consolidate several existing and disparate bus AVL systems into one central system to be used by all PSO bus operators in Ireland. It has expansion capacity to meet the growing demand for public transport in Ireland. The point being made is that we all need to live up to the ambition to make it easier for people to use the app and mobile applications. The Deputy is right. It would be great if we had one platform. The point I need to work more on with the Department is in the context of whether this can be done and, if so, when we can do it.

I appreciate the Minister of State's comments about the regional providers as well and that he is looking to include them more in terms of an overall bus network so we are not hopping between different apps.

The northside has been neglected for far too long. I do not know if it was previous TDs on the northside who went fighting for them or what was happening. There are some stations that only have shelters for the southside users. This is something I am trying to fight for, but if you look at this, people in Donaghmede and Kilbarrack did not receive a leaflet drop. Their station is going to be changed. The people who use that station to commute to work every day would definitely have a better say than some engineer who is going to be plopped onto that project and will not have a clue about where there needs to be a ramp for a buggy or for someone who has accessibility needs. That is why I would like if the Minister of State would, and I appreciate that his office will, look in on behalf of these residents to see why they were not consulted because they have a right to be."

Included in this is an allocation of €700,000 for the Mallow relief road, which is progressing towards the completion of a preliminary business case and planning application. This scheme consists of a northern bypass of Mallow, with the objective of removing traffic travelling between Killarney and Mitchelstown or Fermoy from the town centre.",

This will provide increased scope for development and public realm improvements in Mallow town centre, greatly improving the benefits for residents. The people of Mallow will also benefit from reduced congestion and improved air quality. Reduced congestion in the town centre will encourage walking and cycling and improve safety. The project will also act as an enabler for compact growth in the centre of Mallow, which is a national strategic outcome.",

As part of this phase, there was a minor change of route at the western end of the scheme due to an interface with a Gas Networks Ireland transmission main and to reduce the level of impact caused by the earthworks. Cork County Council aims to complete a preliminary business case for the project by the end of this year. Subject to a satisfactory review by TII of the preliminary business case, it is expected that an application for planning permission for this project will be submitted to An Coimisiún Pleanála in the second quarter of 2026. I look forward to working with Deputy Burke to ensure the project progresses and reaches a satisfactory conclusion."

                    "Walking, wheeling and cycling in these metropolitan areas remove approximately 680,000 car trips every day, reducing congestion and meaningfully cutting emissions. In 2023 alone, active travel saved an estimated 160,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions, equivalent to 2.2 million passenger trips from Dublin to London Heathrow. In addition to environmental benefits, the economic impact of active travel across the five metropolitan areas is estimated at over €3 billion annually, alongside major and important improvements in public health and air quality.",
                    "The Deputy refers specifically to commuters in County Dublin and I am delighted to say that every day those commuters who walk, wheel or cycle are taking nearly 530,000 cars off the road in the Dublin metropolitan area. These practices are saving approximately 120,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. I have more figures here for the Deputy.",
                    "To ensure we are moving in the right direction, the NTA, in conjunction with the relevant local authorities, has produced a transport strategy for the greater Dublin area, as well as metropolitan area transport strategies for the cities of Cork, Limerick and Waterford, with one under way for Galway. These strategies set out the measures that will help us achieve a 51% reduction in emissions by 2030 and set us on a path towards zero net emissions by 2050.",
                    "To verify that the measures in the strategies are being implemented in a co-ordinated, effective and timely manner, the NTA will undertake a monitoring programme and will produce a report which will be finalised for the greater Dublin area in advance of the review of the strategy for the greater Dublin area, which is due to commence in 2026."

Over €80 million has been spent, with €29 million allocated in 2025 alone, to support the various commitments in the national sustainable mobility policy to get people out of cars to walk and cycle instead, as well as the climate action plan which aims to reduce transport emissions overall. Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, of which I was a member, led the way on these schemes. Kilometres of lanes have been built, concrete and plastic dividers have been installed, junctions have been narrowed, filter lanes have been removed, roads have been closed and new traffic lights and traffic sequences have been installed. After five years of investment, and counting, we still do not really have any clarity as to whether this investment is actually delivering because we do not really know whether our emissions have been reduced. We have estimates and surveys but have we actually done the assessment before all of these things were implemented, and afterwards, to see whether the emissions were actually reduced?"

That is the same for every infrastructure project we carry out. There is an assessment carried out before projects are started to see what benefits they will bring. I will go back to the Department to see what other data we have or hope to get because, from my own background, I understand that if we are spending money on something, we have to find out if it is value for money, and not just in an intangible way. We have to see the facts and figures. It is important we see the outcomes that are delivered from the investment of taxpayers' money in these projects.

I attended one of the original proposal meetings on what are now called \"active travel schemes\" back in 2020. The overseeing consultants assured us then that traffic would just disappear if we implemented these schemes. The only real, empirical report I am aware of is on Kilmacud after new cycle lanes, road closures and various other infrastructure were implemented. It showed traffic did not disappear but was just displaced, with increased rat-running car speeds. After that particular scheme, there was actually less walking and cycling in the area. Anecdotally, my constituents in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown report that they are making longer journeys than they did five years ago. For example, a constituent recently highlighted to me that when doing the big family shop, her 3 km car journey from Dunnes Stores in Cornelscourt took her 45 minutes.",

I know that from anecdotal evidence from constituents as well. However, others are driving more and taking longer journeys. My question, therefore, is whether overall emissions are up or down."

We have an integrated transport travel system that will give an experience to pedestrians, cyclists and people using public transport so they will continue to use that. As regards some of the improvements we have to make, in order to get more cars off the road we have to be able to say to people that they will be able to get to places on time, will be able to go shopping and get a bus back, will be able to get to work because a service will be there for them, and that they will have a bit of comfort in whatever mode of transport they use.

                    "There is great alarm, anger and concern among taxi drivers across the country because of the moves by Uber to introduce a fixed fare system. As outlined in the question by Deputy Pa Daly earlier, he alluded to the very serious question on whether this fixed fare being brought in by Uber actually circumvents, undermines or subverts the taxi regulation legislation in this country, which is designed to protect the regulation of the taxi industry, the livelihoods of taxi drivers and the existing fare structure based on the taximeter. This is negotiated every couple of years and takes into account the need for taxi drivers to have a fair income, while taking account of their costs and so on, rather than have price competition, which can undermine their livelihoods and their incomes. The fixed fare structure Uber is trying to bring in is undermining that. It is undermining the taximeter and it means that taxi drivers would not get the fare they should get according to the meter.",
                    "Just in case customers or consumers out there might think this is somehow a good thing for them, they should bear in mind what happens when Uber gets its way. Even if people think in this case there might be some short-term benefit, in reality what Uber does everywhere is undermine the proper regulation of the taxi industry. Here we have proper regulation so you know who your taxi driver is. There is safety and accountability in terms of your taxi driver. It is somebody who is a proper, regulated taxi driver with a licence. What Uber does is try to get rid of all of that and introduce the situation where basically anybody at all can moonlight as a taxi driver and the industry and the livelihoods of taxi drivers are undermined. Once Uber has succeeded in deregulating the industry then it can jack up the fixed fares and can add in all sorts of charges. Currently there is accountability. There is a relationship between the customer and the taxi driver where the customer can see the meter and can see what he or she will be charged because what the charges will be is legally regulated. All of that potentially goes out the window once Uber gets in and prises open the market.",
                    "Taxi drivers will protest this Saturday about it, they have called for a boycott of Uber, and I think they are absolutely right. Taxi drivers should delete the Uber app and they themselves should take action to get Uber out. The Government should also intervene to stop what taxi drivers rightly believe to be an action by Uber that is undermining the regulation of the taxi industry as set out in the taxi regulation Acts and in the maximum fare order."

                    "I thank Deputy Boyd Barrett for raising this. Neither the Minister for Transport nor his Department are involved in the day-to-day operation of the small public service vehicle, SPSV, sector. The National Transport Authority, NTA, the independent transport regulator, has responsibility for setting taxi fares under the provisions of the Consolidated Taxi Regulation Acts 2013 and 2016.",
                    "I am informed that on 3 November 2025, Uber Ireland introduced a new option on their platform providing their customers with a single maximum price for a trip before requesting. This option is referred to on the platform as the taxi fixed price. Usually, when booking a taxi with Uber or other dispatch operators, a price range of the approximate cost of the journey is shown. With the Uber taxi fixed price option, I understand that the customer is now provided with a maximum guaranteed price upfront. If the final price on the taximeter is less than the initial maximum price provided, users pay the lower price on the meter. If the final price on the taxi meter is greater than the maximum price, users pay the maximum price only.",
                    "From a legislative perspective, section 24 of the Consolidated Taxi Regulation Acts 2013 and 2016 empowers the NTA board to make a maximum fares order, fixing the maximum fare that may be charged by the driver of a taxi for any one journey. The current maximum fares order took effect in December 2024, and a maximum fare review is carried out approximately every two years. The NTA has conducted these reviews since 2011. It is important to note that hackneys and limousines agree their fares in advance and do not use a meter.",
                    "The NTA's most recent fare review was undertaken between November 2023 and March 2024. During this review, the NTA took account of the most significant economic issues that were relevant to the SPSV sector, which included inflation and cost of living, fuel prices and energy supply, geopolitical uncertainty and increased public transport availability. Following this review and a public consultation on the matter, the NTA introduced the Taxi Regulation (Maximum Fares) Order 2024, which increased taxi fares by an average of 9%. This came into operation on 1 December 2024 and ensures that taxi fares continue to reflect the rising costs associated with operating a taxi in Ireland. This increase includes a special rate for the weekend peak of 12 midnight to 4.00 a.m. on Friday night into Saturday morning and Saturday night into Sunday morning, year round, to incentivise more drivers to service the night-time economy. This followed on from the October 2022 order in which a 12% increase on fares was introduced.",
                    "As set out in the legislation, charging more than the maximum fare can lead to a prosecution. However, charging below the maximum fare is permitted. The Minister understands that the Uber fixed price offer does not breach the maximum fare regulatory provisions for taxis or constitute an offence associated with the misuse of taximeters. SPSV operators are self-employed and may decide whether or not to sign-up with a licensed dispatch operator, such as Uber. They are not obliged to be affiliated with any dispatch operator. Where they choose to do so, taxi drivers are free to contract with a dispatch operator of their choice. Neither the Minister nor the NTA are parties to the commercial or contractual arrangements between SPSV drivers and their dispatch operators. Accordingly, the Department and the NTA have no role in the approval of such matters.",

Many would have signed up probably not knowing what the implications were of signing up with Uber. This is why they are now calling for a boycott and for the deletion of the Uber app.",
                    "From the point of view of the Government, we have a regulated industry. I believe that Ireland supported Catalonia in a legal case about establishing the right of countries to regulate their own taxi industry. That was the Government responding to pressure from taxi drivers to protect the taxi industry as a key part of our public transport system and to protect the livelihoods of taxi drivers.",
                    "Companies such as Uber and others, with Uber leading the charge, want to create downward price competition, which will undermine the livelihoods of taxi drivers. They should not be allowed to do it. There may be a misconception that somehow the customer is going to benefit from this but they will be sorry in the medium-to-long-term because once Uber gets in, destroys the livelihoods of ordinary taxi drivers and deregulates the industry, it can then jack up the fixed prices to whatever it wants. What we will actually get it is dynamic pricing going upwards in many cases. Taxi drivers would like to see the Government enforce its own legislation to protect the regulation of the industry, which Uber is trying to undermine."

                    "As I mentioned in my opening statement, the regulation of the SPSV industry, including the setting of fares, is a matter for the independent transport regulator. It is also important to say that taxi fixed price is a new trip option recently introduced by Uber in Ireland, whereby passengers see a single maximum price for a trip before requesting it. I understand the Uber fixed price is also available in other jurisdictions in Europe. How it works is that a price is displayed in advance showing the maximum fare for a ride, and the user pays the lower of the metre fare or the maximum price fare. It is set out in the legislation that charges in excess of the maximum fare can lead to prosecution, although charging below the maximum fare is permitted. This is probably the kernel of the problem. If it is underpricing, it means it is pricing other people out of the market. This is something we can go back to and look at from the point of view of the Department and speak to the NTA about it."

This is why we set increases through the regulator, so that people can make a living from it. Being a taxi driver is not the easiest job in the world. The big issue is the dispatch operators that drivers sign up with, what the conditions are and whether they are in breach of the regulations. I will bring this back.

I want to raise some issues that have arisen on certain bus routes that serve my constituency. Some routes are new and others have been in place for a while. I am a big supporter of the BusConnects project. The aim of improving connectivity across our city is very important. I have been on the record for years locally, and now here in the Dáil, as a staunch defender of BusConnects. It is precisely because of this support that it is important we address issues as they arise. I want BusConnects to work for people, so it is important that we listen to them, take their feedback on board and find workable solutions.",
                    "Unfortunately, I have had loads of constituents contact me again in the last few weeks about their own bus disconnect issues. I will touch on the problems we are seeing on the S routes first, which include the S4, the S6 and the S8 through my area. These routes were rolled out in November 2023. They have been plagued with issues ever since. It was particularly bad at the beginning of this year, and in the last couple of weeks, unfortunately, the same issues we had at the start of the year have started to rear their heads again, with ghost buses, cancellations and delays.",
                    "I was listening to the questions the Minister of State took earlier and I know that other Members have raised these issues with him also. The excuse given earlier this year was that the operator of these routes, which is Go-Ahead, was short on mechanics, and I understood that new mechanics were taken on afterwards. The service did improve but now I need to know why the same problems have started to creep back in again. We need to nip it in the bud. We should not have people accepting that, every few months, there will be a period when the bus they rely on to get to work, school or wherever becomes as unreliable as a chocolate teapot for a period of time. The S4 and S6 serve UCD. Again, numerous students have been on to me over the last few weeks telling me they are missing lectures because the bus just never turned up or a series of buses in a row did not turn up. It is noteworthy that these routes are run by Go-Ahead. I have never been particularly comfortable with the privatisation of our bus routes and the level of service on Go-Ahead routes in general has left a lot to be desired.",
                    "I will refer directly to what one of my constituents wrote because she really hit the nail on the head. She emailed me and said it was easy to collect public contracts and revenue while leaving commuters stranded but far harder to uphold the social responsibility that came with providing essential transport to an entire region. She said that when profit took precedence over quality and maintenance, the result was precisely what passengers of the S8 endured daily, with disruption, uncertainty and disregard.",
                    "The other bus route I want to raise is the new F spine and particularly the F1 route. Since its launch in mid-October, it has faced a lot of the same issues. I have raised this with the NTA and it has held its hands up a little bit and explained there were teething issues, as we would expect with new routes, and issues with traffic light sequences. Regarding this route, constituents have been raising with me that there are longer journey times as a result of the new route, particularly from Tallaght and Firhouse. Some people find it is taking them half an hour longer on the new F route than it would have taken them to get into town on the previous 49 bus route.",
                    "It seems to me that the main issue is the fact the new route has been diverted onto residential roads, which have high levels of traffic congestion and do not have dedicated bus lanes. I am not suggesting the entire route be redrawn but I hope the Minister and the NTA will take onboard the feedback from transport users in my area. There may be a case to make that there is sufficient demand for an additional route that may more closely follow the old 49 route.",
                    "Ultimately, I want BusConnects to work but people need reliable and efficient services. We cannot allow a situation to arise where people get into their cars again because they do not have confidence in our public transport."

That being said, I reassure Deputy Ahern that the Government is strongly committed to providing all citizens with reliable and realistic sustainable mobility options, and public transport plays a key role in the delivery of this. To support this objective, the Department of Transport secured €940 million in budget 2026 in funding for public service obligation and TFI Local Link services, an increase of 43% from €658 million in 2025.",

This redesign also introduces new radial services on routes 23, 24, 73 and 82, and the new local route L89, to streamline the network and make services more efficient.",
                    "Ahead of implementation, the NTA undertook extensive communication efforts, distributing over 200,000 booklets to households across the areas covered by the routes. It also advertised the new services in local media outlets and online and provided detailed briefings to local public representatives. It is acknowledged that these changes require some passengers to make their journeys in a different way. In some cases, customers now benefit from direct services where transfers were previously required, while others may need to interchange.",

                    "In the days after the launch of phase 7, the NTA reported a technical fault in the Dublin Bus priority system, which adjusts traffic signals to ease bus movement. The fault lasted three consecutive days and caused unexpected delays, which understandably frustrated customers. Thankfully, the issue was resolved quickly, and performance is expected to continue to improve. While this issue was separate from the BusConnects new service roll-out, it did impact all Dublin Bus routes during that period.",
                    "The NTA and transport operators are working hard to ensure that the services are bedding in well but understand that it can take some time for people to get accustomed to any new arrangement. The kind of issues experienced at the launch of phase 7 are similar to those experienced during the early stages of implementation of previous phases that were addressed and resolved.",
                    "In terms of the S orbital, phase 5b commenced on 26 November 2023 and involved the introduction of new southern orbital, radial and local routes. The S2, 74 and L25 routes are operated by Dublin Bus, while the S4, S6, S8, W2 and L55 are operated by Go-Ahead Ireland. This phase represented a major boost in service levels of approximately 80%. To put that into context, routes 17 and 175 used to provide approximately five services an hour in each direction during peak times.",

It is right that our bus services and bus routes are being redesigned for a city that has changed immeasurably since these bus routes were first implemented, in fact following the old tramlines through the city and keeping many of the old route names, such as the 16. However, when we are bringing in new routes and redesigning a whole network, people also need to understand how the new routes will work for them. I know the NTA has said it has briefed public representatives, but people should not need to come to their TDs to have it explained to them how these new bus routes will work or how they will get from A to B again. I encourage the NTA to arrange more meetings in community centres around the city to explain the changes in these routes to people face to face. This may not be as clear when you get a leaflet through the door - if you do get that leaflet through the door, and people have questioned some of that.",
                    "The new BusConnects system requires people to change or to move from bus to bus where there may not be a direct route any more and you may be expected to change. That is all premised on a city that does not have any traffic congestion for it to work properly. We can get carried away sometimes worrying about contactless payments and things like that. People just want a reliable service from their buses. Some of that is down to our now having to make decisions to prioritise our public transport on our roads, reallocate our road space and make sure that public transport is prioritised over everything else for the greater good of the community."

The important thing is that if the routes do not work right, it is bad value for money.

                    "As the Minister of State, Deputy Dooley, knows, I was born and reared in a coastal location, that is, the beautiful Rossbeigh beach in Glenbeigh, County Kerry, which forms part of Castlemaine Harbour, adjacent to Dingle Harbour, and includes places like Cromane, which is steeped in the history and culture of fishing. They are leaders in the art of aquaculture there. Companies in Cromane and many more throughout the country, including County Kerry, such as Dingle Seafood, Quinlan's in Cahersiveen and Kenmare and companies from Bantry Bay all the way up to the top of Donegal, supply their wares all over Ireland and different parts of Europe, including France, Italy, Holland, Spain and Germany. Exports also go to Asian countries, such as China, Hong Kong and Thailand, as well as the UK and the United States. They regularly feature on the podium of Bord Bia quality awards, showing how well regarded they are in the industry and by the accommodation and hospitality sector. Cromane mussels and oysters are famous not just here at home but all over the world.",
                    "It is the same for all our coastal communities throughout the land as the produce of the Irish aquaculture industry is much sought after by clients at home and abroad. We pride ourselves on the quality of what we produce, supply and export. We pride ourselves on the top-class companies we have. I am flabbergasted by even the thought that aquaculture licences for oysters, mussels and clams, and you could even include salmon as well, can take so long - for example, two, five, ten, 15 or anything up to 20 years. I would be very interested to know how such a scenario could come about. Is it a fault in the application system itself? Is it a computer error or deficiency? Is it a lack of manpower? I am very slow to ask, but is there a deficiency in the training of those who are assigned the task of passing judgment on these applications? Is there an unwillingness to grant more licences? This incredible waiting list is putting at risk businesses and livelihoods that are the lifeblood of our coastal communities. There must be a reason for the delay. Applicants absolutely need to know what chance their application has of succeeding and how long their business hopes and dreams may have to wait.",
                    "I have been raising this issue for many years as a member of Kerry County Council and, more recently, since I became a Member of Dáil Éireann. The Minister of State must agree that waiting up to 20 years to get the go-ahead for your businesses or for the local firm that will give you and your family members employment is totally unacceptable. We must find the reason this has happened in order that we can correct it and bring all the fine aquaculture operators on our Irish coastline, from Castletownbere to Killybegs, into the market without further delay. Young fishermen and fisherwomen can earn a decent living, build that family home, buy a car, live in their own communities and contribute to everyday life in historical fishing communities where there is no other form of employment. If, however, they have to wait years to have an aquaculture licence processed, they will bail out, many to foreign shores, never to return.",
                    "As the Minister of State is aware, I had a number of cases where fishermen and small companies submitted applications when their existing licences were due to expire. Grant aid was available to expand their businesses and they had shovel-ready projects. However, their applications were not processed on time and the projects fell by the wayside. These fishers - men and women - are very annoyed by the manner in which they have been treated by the Department. We must address these deficiencies, get our act together and get to the root of the problem. As I said, I have raised this issue numerous times. We simply must get it right."

I had an opportunity during the summer to visit Quinlan's Kerry Fish with the Deputy and see at first hand the implications of the issue.",
                    "As somebody new to the Department, I recognised from the first that there is a significant problem with licensing. I have undertaken a job of work to try to address this. It will take time but we are working our way through it. I know at first hand the positivity that exists in terms of Irish aquaculture and the demand for the product overseas. Just three weeks ago, I was in Qingdao in China with Irish fishermen, fisherwomen and processors promoting Irish seafood to the Asian market. There is a significant and growing demand, but it is incumbent the State to get the licensing aspect right. I have identified it as a priority and I am working my way through it. Insofar as I can, I will try to address the questions the Deputy asked.",
                    "By way of background, the Department considers all applications for aquaculture licences in accordance with the following legislation: the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1997; SI 236, the Aquaculture (Licence Application) Regulations 1998; the Foreshore Act 1993, as amended; SI 477, the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011; a consolidated environmental impact assessment directive of 2014; and the Aarhus Convention. The criteria to which the licensing authority shall have regard in determining an aquaculture licence application are set out in section 61 of the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1997. The licensing process involves consultation with a wide range of scientific advisers as well as various statutory consultees, as set out in the aquaculture regulations. The legislation also provides for a period of public consultation, the timing and length of which depends on the initial screening assessments carried out by the Department and the Marine Institute.",
                    "The current appropriate assessment process arose from a European Court of Justice case against Ireland in 2007 in which the court declared that by failing to take all the measures necessary to comply with the EU habitats directive in respect of authorisation of aquaculture programmes, Ireland had failed to fulfil its obligations under the directive. A backlog of aquaculture licence applications developed following the judgment. In the negotiations to address the judgment and enable aquaculture to continue in the Natura 2000 areas in the interim, a process was agreed with the European Commission and subsequently implemented. That process included data collection, the setting of conservation objectives by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, identifying the scientific interests to be protected in the bays, the carrying out of an appropriate assessment of the licence application against those scientific interests, and appropriate licensing, taking account of, among other factors, Natura 2000 requirements. This work involved multiple surveys being carried out by a range of contractors. Profiling of aquaculture activities was carried out for all the designated bays to define the likely interaction between such activities and the conservation features. All of this preliminary work to prepare the foundation for the consideration of the licence application process took place from 2009 onwards. Appropriate assessments started to become available from 2011, which allowed licensing to continue.",
                    "As the competent authority for aquaculture licensing, the Department is responsible for ensuring that all applications received are screened in the context of the birds and habitats directive. This work is undertaken by the Marine Institute and externally contracted ecological resources. The current policy in regard to shellfish applications is for the Marine Institute to also provide the Natura impact statements in respect of all applications received. This is a huge resource demand on the State. In addition, an application for a marine finfish licence must be accompanied by an environmental impact assessment report. The Department currently has 36 applications on hand for marine finfish aquaculture. Renewal applications are currently permitted to operate what is referred to as a section 19A (4) application.",
                    "A major delay in processing these applications was the requirement that they be accompanied by an environmental impact assessment report. Almost all the applicants concerned have now submitted finalised applications and environmental implementation reviews. A total of 14 applications have undergone a round of public and statutory consultation, with consultation expected to be held in respect of a number of further applications over the coming months. All applications and supporting documentation are made available on the Department's section of the gov.ie website as part of the consultation process. As the applications concerned are under consideration as part of a statutory process, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on individual applications."

I talk to all those people. I know he will pursue this to a satisfactory conclusion but, as things stand, the situation is totally unsatisfactory. It is more than annoying, particularly for the families I referred to in coastal communities in my county and further afield. I am sure he will get to the bottom of it.",

It lost out on the fishing of wild salmon and all of that, with only a small element of that there today. This is hugely important. There are young people employed in the sector. They are contributing to their local communities, building houses, rearing families and contributing to every aspect of daily life. We want to keep them there and, as I keep saying, we want to keep rural Ireland alive. I will keep raising this hugely important matter until such time as it is addressed. I thank the Minister of State for his work. I put it on the record of the House that we are lucky to have him."

He has raised a really important issue, which is that fishing is really about protecting and preserving our coastal communities through gainful employment by way of the natural resources available to those communities. The reality is that the scientific advice clearly indicates that wild stocks are being depleted for a multiplicity of reasons. These include overfishing by third countries, particularly Norway, the Faroe Islands and Iceland, of important pelagic stocks. Climate change is undoubtedly having an impact, with other aspects of the environment also having an impact.",
                    "We have an opportunity on the aquaculture side to do much more to protect and preserve livelihoods in these communities. I do not accept that we cannot do better in terms of the delivery of the licences. We must give certainty and security to the families who, in the main, operate these businesses. They have invested their hard-earned money and their blood, sweat and tears to get themselves to a certain point, only to find they cannot get their licence renewed. As the Deputy rightly noted, the section 19A(4) process allows them to continue but prevents them from getting the appropriate grants they need to advance their business. It is incumbent on us to get this right.",
                    "I have had quite a number of meetings. Last Thursday, I was at the Marine Institute trying to get to the bottom of what else we need to do. Additional resources have been provided and we have taken on extra head count. We are making progress but the progress made to date is not good enough. I have to take responsibility for that. I will continue to drive to get a better system in place with the structures that are there. I want to review the structures to see whether we can make changes, legitimately and legally, or whether it will be necessary to bring forward amending legislation and look at the overall structure of the way the licensing regime works in order to ensure it will be more fit for purpose and will deliver appropriately while also protecting and preserving the environment and ecology of areas and delivering for local communities."

                    "Gabhaim buíochas le Deputy Ó Snodaigh for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the position in regard to Gaelscoil Lir in Dublin 24. I speak on behalf of the Minister for Education and Youth. My Irish is not as good as Deputy Ó Snodaigh's, so while I could understand most of what he said to me, I will not be able to respond to him in the same way, so it will have to in English.",
                    "First, we will look at the overall position. It is important to say that the Department is committed to offering all available and appropriate supports to schools. In regard to capitation grant funding, the Department is committed to providing funding to recognised primary and post-primary schools in the free education system by way of per capita grants. The two main grants are the capitation grant to cater for day-to-day running costs and the ancillary grant to cater for the cost of employing ancillary services staff.",
                    "The Department has secured €39 million in budget 2026 towards increased capitation funding for primary, post-primary and special schools to provide additional financial support towards their running costs. This will see an increase in the standard capitation rates paid to schools of €50 per pupil for primary schools, from €224 to €274, and of €20 per student for post-primary schools, from €386 to €406. This will also allow for an increase of €20 in capitation rates for urban band 1 DEIS primary schools, increasing the mainstream pupil rate in these schools to €294. The increased capitation rates will also see special schools now receive the same rates of capitation for young people aged 12 and over, as their peers in mainstream post-primary schools.",
                    "It is important to say that the increases announced in budget 2026 are in addition to the 12% increases as part of budget 2025. The last three budgets have resulted in an increase in the level of capitation grant rates of 49.7% paid to primary schools and 28.5% paid to post-primary schools.",
                    "The financial support services unit, FSSU, funded by the Department, is an important source of advice and support to schools on financial matters, including budgeting and cash flow management. We can send the Deputy the contact details for the FSSU. I will not call them out to him.",
                    "Furthermore, if the school should require assistance in regard to financial matters, it is advised to contact officials in the Department. Again, I will ask that the details are supplied to the Deputy.",
                    "The information provided to me tells me that there is no record of contact from this school in relation to capitation or ancillary funding in terms of additional support required, but officials from the Department will make contact with the school in order to get further details."

                    "During last year's election campaign, one of the most frequently raised issues on the doors of Dublin West was the vibrancy of our suburban villages. The villages of Clonsilla, Ongar, Castleknock, Blanchardstown, Mulhuddart and Tyrrelstown are more than just residential areas or urban sprawl; they are distinct communities with their own character, identity and history. My constituents want to live in places with thriving and safe main streets, quality public facilities and amenities and a genuine sense of community. The reality on the ground can be one of congestion, homogenous main streets, unutilised or derelict heritage properties or features and, sometimes, retail vacancy and turnover.",
                    "Earlier this year, I had some positive engagement with Fingal County Council on this issue. Its town regeneration office is delivering town centre first programmes in several rural Fingal communities which qualify for funding under the Department of Rural and Community Development and the Gaeltacht. It uses a toolkit, including a health check, in collaboration with the community, businesses and the council, to set out potential solutions and projects for the village. The town and village renewal scheme, rural regeneration and development fund, RRDF, CLÁR or LEADER funding are then used to fund those projects.",
                    "Obviously, a rural designation would not apply to villages in Dublin 15. However, following my representations, and recognising the value of the town centre first framework and what it would bring to urban communities, Fingal County Council agreed to step outside the box and proceed with health checks for urban villages, funded from the council's resources, later this year or in 2026. This was to include Castleknock and Blanchardstown villages. I am grateful to the council for taking this step. However, it also has a request for me. Its resources will be limited. The key challenge is that the funding streams for the delivery of projects in rural areas, the town and village renewal scheme, the RRDF, CLÁR, LEADER or funding for gathering more elaborate data and doing research under the town centre first scheme is not available for urban villages, which limits the capacity of the council to deliver transformative or regeneration projects.",
                    "We are caught in a funding gap. Our villages are too big for schemes like the town and village renewal scheme, yet too small to qualify for the urban regeneration and development fund. We will be able to diagnose the problems in Blanchardstown and Castleknock, but not necessarily fix them. Suburban villages in my constituency are simply falling through the cracks of the existing funding streams. We need revisions to the town and village renewal scheme and the new towns and cities investment fund or the urban regeneration development fund to enable this much-needed regeneration work across urban communities. It is not just my constituency that would be impacted by this.",
                    "I raised this with the Taoiseach previously and he acknowledged the problem. He suggested I speak to the Minister for public expenditure. I am now coming to the Minister of State. There is a systemic funding gap and it requires a clear and practical solution. The solution is simple and we are staring right at it. We need to revise these schemes, especially for those identified for health checks under the town centre first policy."

As she said, it is a major cross-government policy that aims to tackle vacancy, combat dereliction and breathe new life into our town centres and provide an integrated policy approach to the development of Irish towns. The town centre first policy supports the vision outlined in Our Rural Future for a thriving rural Ireland. It does this by providing a policy framework, financial support and access to funded capital schemes to facilitate the regeneration of rural Irish towns. This is to help make our rural towns and villages resilient and vibrant places to live, work, invest in and visit.",
                    "To this end, the Department’s rural development investment programme operates a range of capital schemes that are targeted at rural areas outside of more urban metropolitan locations. These schemes include, for example, the RRDF and the town and village renewal scheme. The town centre first policy was developed in conjunction with the Minister for housing. As such, the policy can and does have application to communities across larger and more urban towns as well as rural settlements. There are dedicated funding schemes, provided by that Department, available to local authorities to support larger and more urban towns, including the urban regeneration and development fund, the vacant property refurbishment grant under the croí conaithe initiative and the THRIVE scheme which revitalises our heritage buildings.",
                    "In line with its remit, my Department has supported the development of town centre first plans for Dublin towns like Rush and Lusk, which I note are not on the Deputy's list. A key element of the development of a town plan is the community's own identification of priority projects in that town, something the Deputy mentioned. The capital funding schemes available, such as the town and village renewal scheme, can then assist those communities in delivering on their aspirations, be this through a community centre, public realm works, public park or other community facility.",
                    "The town and village renewal scheme was introduced in 2016 and is one of a number of measures designed to rejuvenate rural towns and villages throughout lreland. Since the launch of the scheme, almost €184 million has been allocated to over 1,800 projects.",
                    "The scheme targets funding primarily at towns and villages outside of city metropolitan areas with populations of fewer than 10,000 people. However, towns with a population of up to 15,000 may be eligible if a high-quality application is received. I do not know if that refers to the towns Deputy Currie is speaking about. I heard what she said about the funding gap. I am not fully au fait with all of this, but I can see how some towns could fall through those cracks. While I know the intent of this programme, I still hear what the Deputy is saying. All I can say is that I will certainly bring this to the attention of the Minister. The Deputy is talking about revising these schemes and looking at where the gaps are. I think that is a reasonable and sensible thing to do, and I will make sure that her query and concern are relayed to the Minister."

I acknowledge what she said about the THRIVE scheme and the vacant property refurbishment grant. However, it is the description of the town and village renewal scheme that ticks the boxes I am talking about. It can assist those communities in delivering on their aspirations, be that through a community centre, public realm works, a public park, public lighting or other such community facility. It is the ability for a community to define what the issue is and work together to solve it in a collaborative way. What is happening here is the funds and the policies are excellent and already exist. What we are asking for is to make our communities eligible for them in order that we can have the same opportunity for place making. Our villages are just as distinct and have just as much character. It is to build on that and emphasise it and bring out the best in our communities. That is what making these funds available would do."

It may not be her area but the idea here, and she is the best judge of this, is that this is possible in similar areas, and it is what might be done. I heard what she has said and I fully understand her frustration. While there is really good intent in all of these projects, a really good push behind them and successes, perhaps in some instances it does not fit the place the Deputy is speaking about. It is too big for some areas and too small for others. All I can promise is that the Minister, Deputy Calleary, will hear clearly what the Deputy has had to say on this issue and her concern about the need to perhaps refocus slightly."

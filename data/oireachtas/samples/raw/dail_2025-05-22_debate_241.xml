        <heading>Election of Leas-Chathaoirleach<recordedTime time="2025-05-22T09:30:00+01:00"/></heading>
        <speech by="#RoseConwayWalsh" eId="spk_1">
          <from> An Cathaoirleach<recordedTime time="2025-05-22T09:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_15">Apologies have been received from Senator Tom Clonan and we have some substitutions. Deputy John Lahart is substituting for Deputy Ryan O'Meara and Deputy John Connolly is substituting for Deputy Tom Brabazon. I advise members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings. I will not permit a member to participate when they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement. Therefore, a member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting. I ask any members participating via Microsoft Teams that prior to making their contribution to the meeting, they confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus. Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, I will direct them to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that members comply with any such direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> The first item on the agenda is the nominations for Leas-Chathaoirleach. As agreed at the first meeting of the committee, several nominations for the position of Leas-Chathaoirleach have been received. Several members have nominated Senator Diarmuid Wilson for the position. As only one member has been nominated, I must now put the question, "That Senator Diarmuid Wilson be elected Leas-Chathaoirleach of this joint committee". Is that agreed? Agreed. Go raibh maith agaibh. I congratulate Senator Wilson on his election to the position of Leas-Chathaoirleach. I look forward to working with him. If any member wishes to comment, I open it to the floor. However, I will go to Senator Wilson first.</p>

          <p eId="para_17">I thank the Cathaoirleach. It is a great honour to be nominated to become Vice Chairperson of this committee. I look forward to working with the Cathaoirleach and with all my colleagues for the betterment of the areas of defence and national security. As it is a new committee, I look forward to exploring what positive work we can do. In the unlikely event of the Cathaoirleach not being in a position to chair some of the meetings, I look forward to carrying out those functions to the best of my ability. I thank everyone who nominated and supported me for this position. I look forward to working with all members. </p>

          <p eId="para_18">I will take this opportunity to congratulate the Cathaoirleach. At the last meeting I was online but had a problem being heard; not for the first time. I wish her all the best and have no doubt that she will make a success of it. In relation to my learned colleague from County Cavan, I have no doubt but that if called upon, he will rise to the challenge of the Chair. I wish him all the best in the forthcoming term, as I do all members of the committee.</p>

          <p eId="para_19">I congratulate Senator Wilson on his election as Vice Chair. I know that with the Senator and Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh, the committee is in good hands. I know that they represent the interests of the members, which is the most important thing, and will make sure the committee plays a full a role in terms of defence and national security. I wish both of them well and look forward to working with them.</p>

          <p eId="para_20">I thank the Chair and I congratulate Senator Wilson. He will do an excellent job. He is well respected and has great experience. On behalf on myself and my Fine Gael colleagues, I congratulate him. He is a very fair-minded person and when given the opportunity in the role, he will show that to all members. </p>

          <p eId="para_21">I congratulate Senator Wilson on his role. It looks well for a committee when there is a balance from both sides of the House in the roles of Chair and Vice Chair. It does not happen in every committee but has happened here and we are off to good start. I look forward to working with the members.</p>

          <p eId="para_23">Comhghairdeas, I wish the Cathaoirleach and Leas-Chathaoirleach the best of luck. I echo what Deputy Smith said. It is good to have a balance of Government and Opposition on committees in the roles of Chair and Vice Chair. I hope it is a good augury for the members working together to deliver. I am sure they will work well with the Chair.</p>

          <p eId="para_24">I congratulate Senator Wilson. We now have a full team and it is a good team. Senator Wilson is capable of being somewhat independent when he is in the chair, so in the Cathaoirleach's absence we will be in good hands. I am delighted for the Leas-Chathaoirleach.</p>

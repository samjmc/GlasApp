          <p eId="para_12">Before we proceed with the rest of the meeting, members are reminded of the long-standing practice and ruling of the Cathaoirleach to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. Members are also reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 226 that the committee shall refrain from enquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_13"> We will now examine accounts and statements, correspondence and some information as regards the work programme. We will then suspend for five minutes and resume with engagement with Children's Health Ireland and the National Treatment Purchase Fund. The committee has agreed its work programme until the summer recess. The committee is scheduled to return on 18 September. The first item is correspondence and accounts and statements. Thirteen sets of accounts and financial statements, which were laid between 23 June and 27 June 2025, are due to be considered today. I will ask the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to introduce these before opening the floor to members.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_2">
          <from> Mr. Seamus McCarthy<recordedTime time="2025-07-03T09:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_14">First, we have the accounts of the Market Cap Fund. This is a new fund, which was established on 17 November 2023. The accounting period covers from the date of establishment to 30 September 2024. That received a clear audit opinion.</p>
          <p eId="para_15"> No. 2 is the financial statements of InterTradeIreland, which is one of the North-South bodies. These are the financial statements for 2023. It received a clear audit opinion. However, I will just draw the committee's attention to the fact that the accounts were certified on 10 December 2024, but they were only presented on 24 June, so they were late. The committee's policy is to follow up with the Department concerned with regard to the late laying.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> No. 3 is University College Cork for the period of account 2022-23. These received a clear audit opinion. However, I drew attention to a number of matters. First, I drew attention to €2.1 million of professional fees expenditure that was written off after the dental hospital and school construction project did not proceed to development. Second, I drew attention to weaknesses in financial oversight, which resulted in a deficit of €8.6 million for the year end September 2023 not being identified until December 2023.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">That points to a weakness in its financial oversight systems. I also drew attention to a material level of procurement non-compliance. Finally, I drew attention to the resolution of a long-standing pension liability dispute between the university and the HEA where UCC received €3.225 million in December 2023, pursuant to a settlement agreement. </p>
          <p eId="para_18"> No. 4 is the University of Limerick’s financial statements for 2022-23. It received a clear audit opinion. However, I drew attention to an impairment of €8.269 million on properties acquired by the university in 2019 and 2023. I reported in a special report on that matter, but the financial statements took longer than expected to complete. No. 5 is the University of Limerick’s financial statements for 2023-24. It received a clear audit opinion. </p>
          <p eId="para_19"> No. 6 is the financial statements of An Foras Teanga, or the language body. This is one of the North-South bodies. These are the financial statements for the period of account 2022. It took a long time to get that set of financial statements produced. I signed the audit certificate on 24 September and I gave it a clear audit opinion. They are only being presented now, however, so it may be of interest to the committee to follow up to get an explanation for the further delay in presenting the financial statements. </p>
          <p eId="para_20"> No. 7 is Údarás na Gaeltachta. These are the financial statements for 2023. It received a clear audit opinion. Again, there is a similar delay from certification in December to presentation more than six months later. An explanation might be sought. </p>
          <p eId="para_21"> The remaining accounts and statements are all National Asset Management Agency subsidiaries. I can run through the names of them but they are all of the same nature. They all received a clear audit opinion. The groups' financial statements for the agency have already been presented and noted by the committee. </p>

          <p eId="para_22">I thank Mr. McCarthy. Do members have any comments to make? </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EoghanKenny" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Deputy Eoghan Kenny<recordedTime time="2025-07-03T10:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_23">In relation to University College Cork, the Comptroller and Auditor General has said that there was expenditure of €2.1 million in relation to the dental hospital and that, basically, there is an €8.6 million deficit as well for the year end September 2023, which had not been identified until December 2023. The lack of financial oversight is quite worrying for University College Cork. I will open up to other members on what their belief is in terms of writing to University College Cork for a complete explanation. </p>

          <from> Mr. Seamus McCarthy<recordedTime time="2025-07-03T10:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_25">There is further information in the financial statements in the statement on internal control, which may be helpful to the committee. After examining that, if the committee was minded to seek further information, it could write to it. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnBrady" eId="spk_7">
          <from> An Cathaoirleach<recordedTime time="2025-07-03T10:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_26">We will examine that first. Maybe at next week's meeting we will return to it to decide on a course of action. Do any other members wish to speak on any of the other financial statements? </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CatherineConnolly" eId="spk_8">
          <from>Deputy Catherine Connolly<recordedTime time="2025-07-03T10:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_27">With regard to the University of Limerick and the impairment of more than €8 million, I see there is a note there. I have not got a chance to look at it. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_9">
          <from> Mr. Seamus McCarthy<recordedTime time="2025-07-03T10:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_28">Last summer, I produced a special report regarding those impairments. They relate to the Dunnes Stores site and the houses at Rhebogue. There is substantial detail in the report. It was examined by the previous committee in September 2024. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnBrady" eId="spk_10">
          <from> An Cathaoirleach<recordedTime time="2025-07-03T10:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_29">Do any other members wish to speak? No. The Comptroller and Auditor General identified a number of areas where reports were furnished late. In the first instance, I propose that we write to those bodies whose statements the Comptroller and Auditor General identified to seek an explanation for their delay in publishing. Is that agreed? Agreed. Are members happy to move on? Okay. </p>
          <p eId="para_30"> We will now discuss correspondence received from the Departments and bodies under the committee's remit. First is No. R0167, correspondence from the National Gallery of Ireland. We discussed this in our private session. I propose we note and publish that. Is that agreed? Agreed. </p>
          <p eId="para_31"> Second is No. R0175, correspondence from the Arts Council. This was discussed earlier. Is it agreed to note and publish that correspondence? Agreed. </p>
          <p eId="para_32"> No. R0153 is from the Department of Education and Youth. This was discussed earlier. Is it agreed that we note and publish that correspondence? Agreed. </p>
          <p eId="para_33"> No. R0155 is from the City of Dublin ETB, which was again discussed earlier. Is it agreed to note and publish the correspondence? Agreed. </p>
          <p eId="para_34"> No. R0159 is from the OPW. It was discussed earlier. Is it agreed to note and publish the correspondence? Agreed. </p>
          <p eId="para_35"> No. R0162 is from the Department of Transport. Is it agreed to note and publish that correspondence? Agreed. </p>
          <p eId="para_36"> Are there any other actions relating to the correspondence that members wish to propose? No.</p>
          <p eId="para_37"> We will move on to our work programme. The following meetings were agreed. Next week, 10 July, we will have the Department of Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation with representatives from the National Shared Services Office. On 17 July, we will have the Health Information Quality Authority. The committee will return after the summer recess on 18 September, when it will consider the accounts and statements laid over the summer and the correspondence received by the committee during the recess. For next week's meeting, I propose we bring forward a proposed schedule for the remainder of the year. We can discuss and agree our work programme at that stage. Is that agreed? Agreed. </p>
          <p eId="para_38"> Are there any other items the committee wishes to discuss? No.</p>
          <p eId="para_39"> I wish to flag an item we discussed in private session regarding the Garda Commissioner’s appearance at this committee last week. We discussed this earlier in private session with specific reference to a line of questioning from Deputy Bennett to the Garda Commissioner. She asked the Commissioner whether An Garda Síochána has any concerns that arms are being routinely smuggled through sovereign Irish airspace. The Commissioner said he was not aware of any reports made that An Garda Síochána could investigate. Deputy Bennett further asked An Garda Síochána whether it had checked any of these airlines, to which the Garda Commissioner stated that he had no information that would lead it to undertake such checks. It has been brought to my attention over the course of the week that <i>The Ditch</i> has run a piece on its publication which seems to dispute some of the comments made by the Garda Commissioner. It is only fair and appropriate that we write to the Garda Commissioner to ask him to clarify some of the comments he made because the information <i>The Ditch</i> has alleged certainly seems to dispute some of the remarks made by the Commissioner. I propose we write to the Commissioner to give him an opportunity to clarify the remarks he made. Is that agreed? Agreed. </p>
          <p eId="para_40"> I thank members. We will now suspend until we resume in public session at 10.30 a.m.</p>

          <p eId="para_41">Today we will engage with Children's Health Ireland, CHI, and the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, to discuss CHI's financial statements for 2023 and the financial statements of the NTPF. I welcome Ms Lucy Nugent, chief executive officer; Mr. John Fitzpatrick, interim chief financial officer; Ms Eilish Hardiman, strategic programme director; Ms Julia Lewis, transformation director; and Ms Paula Kelly, clinical director, CHI. I welcome Ms Fiona Brady, chief executive officer; Mr. Don Gallagher, chair; Mr. Seán Flood, director of finance; and Ms Bernadette Weir, director of commissioning, NTPF board. We are joined by officials from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, including the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, who is a permanent witness to the committee, and Ms Paula O'Connor, deputy director of audit. </p>
          <p eId="para_42"> I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards reference they make to other persons in their evidence. The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege. This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting. However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach that this privilege is not abused. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory with regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with such direction.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_9">Witnesses are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that may be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory regarding an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_10"> I ask Mr. Seamus McCarthy, the Comptroller and Auditor General, to now make his opening remarks.</summary>

          <p eId="para_43">The National Treatment Purchase Fund board has responsibility for the management of a range of activities within the healthcare system. Its main activity comprises identification of and payment for treatment or assessments to assist in reducing inpatient and outpatient waiting lists in public hospitals. The board also has an important function in assessing and approving the scope and level of charges for long-term care in private nursing homes for people availing of the Health Service Executive's fair deal scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_44"> The board's financial statements for 2023 record an effective break-even situation with total income and total expenditure of slightly more than €190 million. Almost all of the board's income comes from Vote 38 - health. The board's income and expenditure have both grown rapidly in recent years. To illustrate this, the board's expenditure in 2023 was almost three times the expenditure of €64.8 million incurred in 2019. The board secures treatment and assessments for waiting list patients in private hospitals and in public hospitals which offer space capacity to provide required patient care. In 2023, payments made to private hospitals amounted to €107 million, while payments to public hospitals amounted to €72 million. This represents a reliance of 60% on private healthcare providers and 40% on public healthcare providers in 2023. Note 3(b) to the financial statements analyses the payments by medical specialty, indicating the range of areas in which care is purchased. Payments to individual hospitals are not shown in the financial statements. The board's payroll costs and other administrative expenditure amounted to €11 million in 2023. Included in this are costs of slightly more than €1 million in respect of the board's price negotiation function with private nursing homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_45"> I issued a qualified audit opinion in respect of the agency's financial statements for 2023, but only in respect of the accounting treatment of retirement benefit liabilities for the board's staff. This is not in line with standard accounting practice, but does comply with the accounting directions of the Minister for Health, which are common to a number of health sector bodies I audit. The 2023 financial statements were certified on 30 September 2024. Members may wish to note that I certified the financial statements for 2024 last week. I understand the process for presenting those financial statements is in train with the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_46"> I outlined the key financial results for the 2023 year of account when the representatives of Children's Health Ireland, CHI, were last before the committee on 22 May and I do not propose to repeat that presentation this morning. Since the meeting of 22 May, details of an internal examination undertaken by CHI in 2021-22 have come to public attention. As I have previously explained to the committee, my office was not provided with a copy of that report at the time it was finalised or when the audit of the hospital's financial statements for 2021 was being undertaken. My office has in recent weeks received a copy of the report. While the main focus of the internal report is personnel management concerns in a clinical department in part of the hospital, it also raises some concerns around a number of financial risks, including controls over claims in respect of care paid for by the National Treatment Purchase Fund. Due to the report's findings with regard to those financial risks, the hospital should have brought the report to the attention of the audit team in the course of the audit of the 2021 financial statements. The control implications of the report's findings will now be considered as part of the audit of the hospital's 2024 financial statements, which is currently ongoing.</p>

          <from> Ms Lucy Nugent<recordedTime time="2025-07-03T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_48">I thank the committee for the opportunity to again address it and to give a further update on work that is happening across our children’s hospitals and commissioning programme for the new children’s hospital. I am the CEO of CHI and I am joined by my colleagues Mr. John Fitzpatrick, interim chief financial officer; Ms Julia Lewis, CHI’s transformation director; Ms Eilish Hardiman, strategic programme director; and Ms Paula Kelly, clinical director.</p>
          <p eId="para_49"> I have now been five months in this job and despite the various challenges we have had - and I will speak about those later - I reiterate that I am proud to represent our almost 5,000 staff, who work diligently at the front line of paediatric healthcare provision in CHI at Temple Street, Crumlin and Tallaght, and at our urgent care centre at Connolly Hospital. Across 39 specialties, we provide exceptional care to children and young people in old buildings that are not fit for purpose. We continue to lead on paediatric research and innovation on an international stage because, as I have said many times before, our children and young people deserve the best that medicine and science can offer. When we discuss the challenges and mistakes of our organisation, let us not forget the remarkable work that our staff do to care for children, young people and families every day.</p>
          <p eId="para_50"> With regard to recent clinical issues raised, I again give full recognition to the families affected by the recent HIQA report, the developmental dysplasia of the hip, DDH, report and the unpublished internal report. On all these issues, on behalf of CHI, I apologise unreservedly. Children, young people and their families were failed and we need to rebuild trust in CHI.</p>
          <p eId="para_51"> I will speak briefly about the issue of publication of the various reports and the suggestion that CHI has been evasive in reporting or commenting on these issues. CHI is a statutory body and must respect the legal advice we receive, not to mention the moral imperative to protect the confidentiality of patients. We also have a duty to see that matters are properly investigated and that due process is carried out. This can sometimes mean that we cannot comment on matters, even if they are reported in the media or elsewhere. This does not mean that we are not mindful of the great upset that such reports cause parents and children, and the gravity of the issues. However, I assure members that this is never the intention. Our intention is always to ascertain the facts and take steps to fix the issues, while at the same time telling parents and children what we are doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_52"> In my first five months, I have worked with the board and my executive colleagues to enhance our governance structures and stabilise the executive management team with the hiring of a permanent director of people and culture, a deputy chief executive officer and a chief operations officer. The recruitment of a chief finance officer and a director of quality, safety and risk management has commenced. I am delighted that these high-calibre, new colleagues have chosen to join CHI.</p>
          <p eId="para_53"> I will update Deputies on recent reports regarding CHI and the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF. There was some misunderstanding in media reports about NTPF payments to a CHI consultant. I can confirm that the clinics at the centre of the reports did not take place in the consultant’s private rooms. They occurred in a public clinic in one of our hospitals on a Saturday. It was a waiting list initiative for outpatient appointments only. A longer term, sustainable solution for referral management was put in place and the roll-out of this system is ongoing. All services will be on this central referral system in the coming months.</p>
          <p eId="para_54"> CHI will move into the newly named national children’s hospital Ireland. In May, we updated the committee on plans to undertake a programme of commissioning to see our services - finally - move into a building worthy of the children of Ireland, that is operational to international standards. For the past six years, we have been building our organisation for that moment. We are integrating our teams. We are integrating our ways of working and we are integrating and improving our culture. This is complicated and difficult, but vital.</p>
          <p eId="para_55"> In conclusion, CHI fully acknowledges that we have fallen short of the high standards children and families deserve. We are deeply sorry for the harm and distress caused. We want to do better and we are committed to building an organisation defined by openness, compassion and learning. As a learning organisation, we will take inspiration from leading international children’s hospitals which have demonstrated that safety and trust are built on three pillars. First, under a culture of continuous learning and development, we will create an environment where every staff member feels safe and supported to speak up when things go wrong, and where we act quickly to learn and improve. We want a true partnership with children and families and will put children and families at the centre of all decisions about their care. This means working with parents as equal partners, ensuring they are informed, respected and empowered to shape services.</p>
          <p eId="para_56">We want transparency and accountability. We are committed to being open about our challenges as well as our successes. We will publish regular updates on our progress in reducing waiting lists, improving outcomes, safety and strengthening our governance. We recognise that rebuilding trust will take time, but we are determined to ensure that every child who comes to CHI receives the safest, most innovative and compassionate care possible. We will get there, and CHI has the determination, skills and ability to see the new hospital project to completion and beyond.</p>

          <p eId="para_57">I thank Ms Nugent. I now ask Mr. Don Gallagher, chairman, to make his opening statement on behalf of the National Treatment Purchase Fund.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_16">
          <from> Mr. Don Gallagher<recordedTime time="2025-07-03T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_58">I thank the Chair and the Committee of Public Accounts for today's invitation to discuss the role of the National Treatment Fund as part of Ireland's public health system. I was first appointed to the NTPF board in March 2021 and became chair in July of that year. I was reappointed as chair last March for a second term. I am an experienced chief executive who most recently managed the Health Insurance Authority before retiring and have served on the boards of State organisations and international insurance companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_59"> I am joined by the NTPF’s CEO, Ms Fiona Brady, who was appointed to the role in July 2023. Ms Brady was previously CEO of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital Drogheda and Louth County Hospital for five years and has first-hand knowledge of the workings of the acute hospital system relating to scheduled and unscheduled care.</p>
          <p eId="para_60"> As the committee will be aware, and as already mentioned, the NTPF has three key responsibilities: commissioning inpatient and day-case procedures, outpatient appointments, gastrointestinal scopes and diagnostics for the longest waiting public patients; collecting, collating and validating public hospital waiting lists; and negotiating the maximum price of long-term residential care under the fair deal scheme. The third is a vitally important task, in terms of nursing home residents and for national finances. The NTPF concluded 300 negotiations with individual nursing homes last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_61"> For the purpose of today’s meeting, I will focus on the NTPF’s commissioning role as part of the multiagency strategic approach to improve health outcomes for patients, explaining our approach and impact. I will also address the actions the NTPF has taken in recent weeks following allegations of misuse by public hospitals of funding provided for approved insourcing initiatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_62"> On the commissioning front, the NTPF ensures public patients get faster access to timely care through insourcing arrangements with public hospitals and outsourcing arrangements with private hospitals. Outsourcing arrangements involve the NTPF procuring treatments and care for public patients in private hospitals. Every year private hospitals tender to offer care across a wide range of specialties. We select the hospitals with available capacity and suitability of location, giving the NTPF options to offer treatment and care across almost all specialties, from cataracts and hip replacements to scopes and first-time consultations.</p>
          <p eId="para_63"> We review hospital waiting lists regularly, enabling us to identify the longest waiting patients for certain specialties. Working with the referring public hospital, we offer patients the option of treatment or care in a private hospital. The welfare of the patients is always of the utmost importance, with only patients confirmed as clinically suitable for outsourcing by their hospital offered treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_64"> Patients must also agree to the treatment. If a patient declines an offer, we will call them to see if there is anything we can do that would make the treatment offer a possibility for them. The patient will always receive a full episode of care. For example, if they have a knee replacement, we will also arrange a full programme of follow-up physiotherapy and consultant reviews at the same hospital. Only when the patient is fully discharged is payment made to the private hospital. It is important to note that the NTPF pays the treating hospital, not the consultant.</p>
          <p eId="para_65"> Outsourcing with private hospitals accounts for approximately 70% of our commissioning work. The remaining 30% is focused on insourcing initiatives, which have been at the centre of recent media discussion. Insourcing is where the NTPF provides funding directly to public hospitals for treatment or outpatient consultations seen outside core activity, that is, additional to the activity funded by the HSE. Insourcing means we can maximise the existing resources in the public hospital system.</p>
          <p eId="para_66"> The process involves senior management in public hospitals applying to the NTPF to secure funding, outlining their opportunity to get long waiting patients treated faster and providing a specific treatment plan and solution. The application is reviewed by our commissioning team and then forwarded to NTPF senior management for approval.</p>
          <p eId="para_67"> The NTPF has strong financial oversight procedures and processes in place to administer insourcing funds. It only makes payment in respect of specific, named patients who have been on a public hospital waiting list, and then only on receipt of detailed invoices from the public hospital confirming that care is fully complete and the specific named patient has been discharged. Payments are made only to the hospital and never to any individual consultant or staff member. Internal governance on the management of the insourcing work remains with the referring public hospital, with the agreement under the NTPF’s memorandum of understanding that the funding is used as specified and agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_68"> On the impact on patients, the NTPF’s approach to commissioning front-line care has been overwhelmingly successful in ensuring public patients get access to quicker treatment over the past number of years. Since 2019, the NTPF has arranged surgery or care for almost 1 million public patients, helping the system move closer to Sláintecare waiting times targets. Over the last two years, almost 500,000 public patients received their surgery, consultant appointment, scope or diagnostic scan faster because of the NTPF.</p>
          <p eId="para_69"> Last year, the NTPF exceeded its patient treatment targets set out in the 2024 waiting list action plan by over 10%. This year, it is again ahead of its set treatment and care targets for 2025. Last year, NTPF activity between commissioning and validation accounted for the removal of over 317,000 public patients from the scheduled care waiting lists.</p>
          <p eId="para_70"> Turning to the allegations of the misuse of funds, the NTPF and its board have been deeply concerned by recent allegations of breaches of its processes by public hospitals concerning insourcing initiatives. The NTPF first learned of the internal CHI report outlining the misuse of NTPF money in CHI through the media. We immediately placed a temporary pause on all insourcing work with CHI and initiated a review of this work. Both parties worked closely together, and on receipt of the appropriate assurances by CHI management confirming its ongoing compliance with existing NTPF procedures, we recommenced insourcing work. The engagement of the CHI senior management and CEO, Ms Lucy Nugent, greatly expedited the process, thereby minimising the impact on patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_71"> On learning of potential issues in regard to NTPF-funded insourcing work at Beaumont Hospital, the NTPF immediately suspended all insourcing work and payments at Beaumont and informed the Department of Health and HSE of its concerns. The HSE's internal audit is currently carrying out a detailed review in Beaumont. We are ready and willing to recommence insourcing once we receive the necessary assurance regarding the appropriate use of NTPF funds. We are working closely with the HSE regional executive office on this matter. </p>
          <p eId="para_72"> The public must have full confidence and trust in the insourcing process. We are working alongside the Department of Health and HSE to increase governance and oversight across our insourcing work with public hospitals. As part of this process, the NTPF CEO has written to all hospitals which participate in insourcing initiatives funded by the NTPF to seek assurances of full compliance with our memorandum of understanding. We are now assessing the responses received and will provide a comprehensive report to the Department of Health and HSE. </p>
          <p eId="para_73"> Looking to the future, the board and executive of the NTPF take their responsibilities to the public taxpayer very seriously. We will take whatever actions are necessary to ensure our spend is fully protected for the benefit of public patients and taxpayers. While waiting lists remain a challenge for the general hospital system, our priority for the remainder of the year is to continue to work with the Department of Health and the HSE to get long-waiting public patients access to treatment and care and keep overall waiting times as low as possible as we continue to work to achieve our Sláintecare targets. I thank the committee.</p>

          <p eId="para_76"> I now open the floor to members. The lead speaker today is Deputy Grace Boland. She has 15 minutes for questions and answers. All other members will have ten minutes. If time permits, I will allow members to come back in for a second round.</p>

          <p eId="para_77">I thank the witnesses for attending today. While this committee tends to focus on figures and finances, we need to remember that behind every number is a child, a patient, a family and a story. We cannot lose sight of that. I welcome Ms Nugent's comments today about wanting to do better, putting children first and putting families at the centre of decisions. Communication is really key to that and we need to see improvements in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_78"> I understand CHI has accepted the DDH audit findings and that a review of patients is under way. CHI's position is that the review is comprehensive. I have been contacted by several constituents with queries and concerns about the review. One example is a mother who recently contacted me. She has two daughters, one aged seven and the other aged five. Both had the surgery in recent years. One surgery was done in Temple Street hospital and the other was done in Cappagh hospital. One of her children has been included in the review while the other child has not. The mother has tried to get answers as to why the other child has not been included in the review. The response she got was that her other daughter was excluded because she has additional health issues. To my mind, that child is actually more vulnerable and should be included in the review. Will Ms Nugent confirm if that is the case? Has there been an error here? Can we be certain that every child who has had this surgery is included in the review?</p>

          <p eId="para_79">I am very happy to get the name of that family afterward and look into it for the Deputy. A total of 2,259 children and families were written to regarding this audit. If that family wants their child reviewed, I do not see any reason we could not include her. I will be happy to revert to the Deputy in that regard. Some children have ongoing long-term surgery management in relation to additional comorbidities. That may be the reason. I may defer to my colleague Ms Kelly in that regard to provide further information.</p>

Some families may not even fully realise. There needs to be much more communication with this family. This is only one family who have come to my attention in recent days. I have serious questions and concerns about this. It is not good enough, to be honest. If we are looking at a patient-centred approach, we need to do better.

          <p eId="para_98">The NTPF has clearly played a vital role in tackling waiting lists and has removed more than 370,000 public patients from waiting lists. In light of recent revelations, it is important that we take a closer look at how the funding has been applied. No fewer than three hospitals have had funding ceased due to concerns regarding the misuse of those funds. The Minister and Bernard Gloster are hoping to remove insourcing, although if I have read the accounts right, the funding going into insourcing has only increased in recent years. It is hard to wade through all of the information we have been given and the media reports. Have more than three hospitals been flagged regarding potential misuse of NTPF funding?</p>

          <p eId="para_99">The Deputy is aware of the Beaumont Hospital issue and the CHI issue. Naas General Hospital was mentioned during yesterday's health committee meeting. The NTPF did not cease funding for Naas General Hospital. The hospital had full disclosure with the HSE and with me. Of its own volition, the hospital decided it would cease all insourcing temporarily while we waited on Mr. Gloster to send in the HSE internal auditors to review. We did not cease funding; the hospital itself did it.</p>

          <p eId="para_101">As Mr. Gallagher mentioned in his opening statement, after the issues arose in Beaumont Hospital and CHI, I carried out a national assurance review.

I will then provide a full and comprehensive report to the Department of Health and to Mr. Gloster.</p>

          <p eId="para_102">I found the idea of insourcing and the prolonged use of it baffling. It took me a while to get my head around the fact that we were paying people in the HSE not just overtime rates but going around the system and using HSE facilities to pay them a huge premium to do work at the weekends or through the NTPF. I would like to see the insourcing model phased out over the next couple of years. I note the Minister's comments wanting to see it phased out very quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_103"> In terms of the money given to private and public hospitals, as the Comptroller and Auditor General highlighted, it is not clear which hospitals are at the top in terms of being funded through the NTPF for public or private treatments.

It is really about if you get a call in the middle of the night to operate on a sick baby or treat a sick baby, you need to be in the full of your health.

It is about making sure that we fully utilise our outpatients, theatres, etc. We also now have a central referrals office. Referrals come in through that and they are equitably distributed among specialties so we do not have huge variance in waiting lists per consultant. There will, however, always be some variance where a specific specialised service may be needed in one particular department and maybe only one or two of those colleagues could do that.</p>

It is Government practice and policy for non-commercial State board CEOs to be appointed for no more than two concurrent five-year terms. The Minister applied that policy, which is within his right to do, and that was accepted by the board. Because it is an employment matter and because it was two fixed terms, the contract automatically became a contract of indefinite duration.

I do not have the time to read it out but Ms Nugent can take it that I have read every single bit of it. Multiple legacy and deep-rooted issues existed but they were not addressed and so on. Two senior examiners were appointed. Who can tell me about that report and why Ms Nugent was not informed about it?</p>

Clearly they were not working and there is nobody here today to tell me why the new CEO was not aware of this report which has ongoing consequences. Even the NTPF is mentioned in that.

          <p eId="para_158"> This is a shocking report. I will not go into whether it should be published in full. What I have is utterly shocking.

In the meantime, this is the legacy: unnecessary surgery being done, delayed spinal surgery and implants going in that were not suitable.

          <p eId="para_217">I thank all the witnesses for joining us here today. Many apologies have been issued in Ms Nugent's opening statement. She has said "sorry" a good few times to the families affected. Of course this is needed due to the trauma of the scandals that have come out. The test of those apologies will be the lessons that are learned going forward. I note that Ms Nugent admitted to a colleague earlier today that, in hindsight, she should have consulted the Comptroller and Auditor General and the NTPF on the unpublished report. She has claimed that the HSE was aware of the existence of this report since March 2022. The HSE has denied this. As recently as yesterday at the health committee Mr. Bernard Gloster, head of the HSE, firmly denied it. It is his view that this report was never brought to the attention of the HSE. How do we have a situation where CHI can say it sent on this very serious report with very serious issues in it - Mr. Gloster has accepted there are very serious issues in it - and Ms Nugent claims CHI sent this report back in March 2022, yet there is no evidence of this? Can Ms Nugent provide evidence of this?</p>

          <p eId="para_226">We can take from that what it is. Coming back to Ms Nugent, sections of this report have been referred to the Garda for potential misuse of public funds and it was the HSE that actually referred them. CHI did not refer the report and sat on it despite the timeline outlined here going back to 2021. CHI never sought an opinion from the HSE or the Department despite clear evidence of unnecessary clinics and, to us, misuse of public funds that happened in CHI Crumlin. It seems that even after the HSE sent the report to the Garda, CHI continued to oppose this. It was mentioned that it did not meet the threshold. Is that correct?</p>

          <p eId="para_227">That is correct and we respect the HSE's position. On examination, in relation specifically to the unsubstantiated statements in that report, they were investigated. </p>
          <p eId="para_228">As I said, the actual clinic proposal to the NTPF was done by the operations team, based on the fact that there were long waiting lists in 2021, which was post Covid-19. The individual consultant was asked, as were many consultants post Covid-19, to get involved in doing NTPF clinics to try to address the waiting lists. As I said, the individual did this above his contractual hours and was paid through the HSE-----</p>

          <p eId="para_231">It is bizarre that the HSE, out of an abundance of caution, did the right thing, which was to refer this matter to the Garda for a determination, but CHI took it upon itself to do the Garda's work for it and decide the matter did not meet the threshold for investigation. Even after this came out and blew up publicly, CHI has still held that view. That does not attest to the new culture of transparency that was outlined on multiple occasions in Ms Nugent's opening statement. In fact, it does quite the opposite. I ask Ms Nugent to answer "Yes" or "No" to the following question. Does she still believe that the potential misuse of public funds does not merit a Garda investigation?</p>

          <p eId="para_233">As I have said, although I cannot take it as certain, it seems that in all these instances the HSE is doing the right thing. It wanted this report to be published. It wanted the misuse of public funds to be investigated by the Garda but CHI was not on board with that. CHI has opposed publishing the report in full and it is still not published. Only a sanitised and editorialised, if that is the word you want to use, version has been published. The head of the HSE is not resiling from his view that an anonymised version of this report could and should have been published. Here we have a situation whereby the head of the HSE has a fundamental difference of opinion with CHI on this point. CHI chose not to publish the report. Does Ms Nugent's view remain that it should not be published?</p>

          <p eId="para_234">We redacted a version of the report to see if it would make sense to our stakeholders. It did not make sense. We wanted to go further and state what we did on receipt of the report. The 32 recommendations, bar two, have been closed and can only be closed when we move to the new children's hospital. We are trying to provide further assurance and not just a blacked-out and redacted report. It was primarily a HR report. The 45 staff who participated and were interviewed did so on the basis of confidentiality so they could be open and transparent, and give the information we needed to find. From that perspective, we stand by our decision.</p>

When the Dixon report was completed nearly a decade ago, it identified a cohort of children with spina bifida who had fallen through the cracks and were receiving suboptimal care. If we fast forward five years to when this review was done, CHI could not even tell the reviewer how many children were affected. Their care plans were never changed and this review found that those children were still receiving suboptimal care. We are talking about the families of 38 orphaned children in this instance. Were their parents notified?</p>

They have been stonewalled. To refer again to Ms Nugent's opening statement, she said, "Our intention is always to ascertain the facts and take steps to fix the issues, while at the same time telling parents and children what we are doing." That is not the case. We must ask what is going on. The witnesses are talking about accountability. They have multiple reports, including the unpublished one and the digital one.

In respect of the numbers in the clinics, those other clinics were longer than our normal clinics because they had lots of room to themselves. The patients who were taken off the list were probably less complex because they were at the end. Inevitably, they could be seen quickly. The original clinics were supposed to be off site because of Covid-19 and the restrictions in our hospitals at the time. That meant the patients that could be called did not need to have X-rays and could not have phlebotomies or laboratory work. That restricted the types of work we could do and numbers of patients we could see. There are circumstances around here-----</p>

There was extensive and ongoing engagement with the NTPF in 2021 around these clinics. This matter should have come up then and it did not. I regret that.

          <p eId="para_378">This is with the benefit of hindsight but that is what we are here to do. Clearly, Ms Hardiman's intentions were good in terms of trying to identify challenges within the culture and this individual but the outworkings of the report produced a whole other host of stuff that the CHI effectively just ignored. It did not carry out any further due diligence on the issues of the NTPF. It is only now, all these years later, because the NTPF issue has been published that we are seeing this unravelling into other hospitals like Beaumont Hospital, Naas hospital and two unidentified hospitals. This is where transparency matters. I am unbelievably frustrated with the responses relating to open disclosure and that there was no scientific evidence to tell these parents. I am the parent of three children. If my child was entitled to be treated in a hospital in accordance with the waiting list and they were not treated in that time, you should bloody well tell them. Why have the witnesses not told the parents of these children that they did not get the operations in the time they should have because there was a rogue individual involved in using waiting list initiatives in a way that should not have been done?</p>

When an initiative comes in from an acute hospital, the commissioning team reviews it and we make sure it is the patients who have been on the waiting list the longest who have been requested to be seen.

We do not pay consultants directly, only the hospitals, and then they pay the individual staff.

I will finish by giving her the opportunity to recap where things are now in respect of confidence in the institution, confidence in the transition and confidence in the future of CHI. Many people have communicated with me their abject lack of confidence in the institution. That is not the workers or the experience for children who are able to access the services but for what the future looks like in a transition period of such importance. I want to give Ms Hardiman the floor for the remaining time I have, to share what the future might look like for CHI under her leadership.</p>

          <p eId="para_459">No problem at all. I fully recognise that we have to rebuild both our reputation and the trust that we need – that of the public, our patients and our staff. The future is bright. We have an amazing building, but a building does not deliver care, the people do. The most important thing is to ensure that we attract, retain and develop the best staff that we can to provide the best care that we can. That is just not what we are doing now; it is what we can do in the future. There is the opportunity to bring together all these fantastic staff from multiple sites into one location and two satellite centres. That will enable us to repatriate some things that are sent abroad from a diagnostic or care point of view. That is important because having to travel when you have a sick child is stressful even if it is from Donegal or Cork, let alone getting on a plane or boat.</p>
          <p eId="para_460"> We want to expand and develop our services. We want to have research and innovation at the centre of what we do. Medicine and healthcare continues to evolve at a rapid pace and I want to make sure our staff are aware of what we can offer our families in a safe way and in a quality-driven way to drive outcomes. We are focusing on that more. We are learning how we can do better. Our parents, children and young people are part of that process, as well as everyone around this table.</p>
          <p eId="para_461"> As I said, I could talk about the transformation programme, but I think we are running out of time. There is an extensive transformation programme led by my colleague, Ms Julia Lewis, which ensures that staff are ready.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">This is a unique and transformational opportunity for the State and for us in CHI. We are merging three entities with three cultures but with shared values. We are going into an amazing building. We will be fully digital. That is challenging but we are up for that challenge. Equally, we are being well prepared through our Eolas education and training programme. There is a tried and tested methodology. For example, one is called a go-live readiness assessment. I would hand over to Ms Lewis, but we have run out of time.</p>

          <p eId="para_466">In relation to our actual governance structures, when I took up my role initially, the clinical director role was such that clinical directors had site responsibility and were not with their actual teams. We have rearranged that and we have also taken site responsibility from the clinical directors. No disrespect to my colleagues, who are fantastic, but they would not necessarily have the skill set. Also, they have enough to do in the clinical director role. In this regard, they have a bit more time now to engage with our clinical colleagues.</p>
          <p eId="para_467"> We are rolling out our clinical specialty leads programme, so each speciality will have a lead.

          <p eId="para_470">The culture is largely positive. There are pockets of culture that are not working, but that is not across the entire organisation. I would be doing a disservice to my colleagues if I said otherwise. There are a number of cultural programmes under way. Some of my colleagues are down in Dr. Steevens' Hospital as we speak. We will be joining them afterwards. We are doing a full-day workshop with the HSE about the national culture programme it is rolling out. We have put our hands up to engage in that.</p>
          <p eId="para_471"> Staff need get to know me. I am new, so I have made it my business to have the engagement sessions I was talking about. However, we also need to listen to the people who use our services. That is important. We are lucky that we have the youth advisory council.

          <p eId="para_488">It was an employment law matter. The board of the CHI appoints the CEO in accordance with the Act and with the approval of the Minister for Health. I had two fixed-term contracts. That was part of the hospital group structure. I was in the HSE before the board was established in 2019. I transferred to the CHI as part of that legislation. The board then asked and recommended that I be extended for a third term. The Government policy position on this is that non-commercial State board CEOs are appointed for a five-year term up to two consecutive periods.</p>

It is all part of the process. We do it under four criteria. One of those is the cost reasonably incurred and value of money to the State. We make an offer and it is then a decision for the nursing home whether or not to accept it. We do a detailed financial analysis of each nursing home.</p>

          <p eId="para_562">We know about all of governance irregularities and clinical discrepancies at CHI and as my colleague pointed out earlier it is the child and their family who are at the centre of it. We are here today trying to disclose facts. We are not trying to prosecute. However, it is important the families remain our sole motivator to ensure that children get the best care possible and that the taxpayer does not overpay. It is important that staff in CHI and other hospitals work in environments that are transparent, well-run and fair to them. That has to be the core mission for Ms Nugent and her team. We are going to see a move to the new hospital soon. It is a really big project. It is one of the biggest projects ever undertaken by the HSE. It is a huge amount of work for the CHI team. The public wants to ensure there is transparency and as politicians we also want to see transparency. Ideally we will not have to ask representatives from CHI in again because of something we have read in the newspaper. We do not like working reactively. We like to have a work programme. It is unfortunate that we had to ask it in again but we are happy that the witnesses have co-operated with us and have come in again. It is the children and families who have to be at the centre of what we do and everything the CHI does. If any of the witnesses from CHI wish to comment, I would be grateful.</p>

          <p eId="para_563">I agree with everything Deputy Ardagh said. The reason our staff get out of bed everyday and come in is that they are committed to providing excellent care that is patient centred. As I said before, we want to make sure that we are transparent and engaging. A family advisory network was established in 2023 with families who attend CHI. We intend to expand that programme. Our youth advisory council is fantastic. Giving young people a voice is important. Sometimes people think that because of their age, they do not have an opinion. We are all guilty of it. They have an important voice. This is reflected in the design of the new children's hospital. </p>
          <p eId="para_564"> People have to trust that when they are handing over their child to us, they will receive the best care as if they were our own children, so I 100% agree with the Deputy. Everyday our staff come into work to do a good job. We have failed on occasion. We are going to learn from that. Healthcare is a risky business. Can I say it will never happen again? I would love to say 100% that something will never happen again. Unfortunately given the nature of our business sometimes things go wrong. What I can guarantee is we will learn from it and hopefully that things will not go wrong again. It might be something else. We are a learning organisation. We are very cognisant of the privilege we have in respect of the young people and their families.</p>

          <p eId="para_634">Just to be clear, we had a management intervention. There was a whole action plan team. There was consistent reporting back to the board in relation to this. Most importantly then, the actions were taken using the appropriate HR processes to actually address the concerns, because they were very serious concerns and it was quite shocking to get that report. We genuinely engaged with the staff to say, “We’re here. We’re going to listen and we’re going to act. Please tell us what you need and what are the issues and concerns”. I think we demonstrated here that we were not afraid to act and that the staff have trusted us in raising those and some were terrible to hear but I give assurance those were addressed. Ms Nugent has met the teams since and they are in a much better place.</p>

          <p eId="para_705">That is further clarification I have sought. We agree the €200, which covers the consultant, the cost of clerical staff who check them in in overtime and potentially nursing staff because a team is needed to run an initiative at the weekend.

          <p eId="para_712">Good morning. I thank the witnesses for being here today and for the work they do. As other speakers have said, the scale of even the issues for which the witnesses are here before us is vast. I acknowledge the scale of the work they do outside of all of that. As the nature of this committee is that we focus on things that go wrong, I just wished to highlight that. </p>
          <p eId="para_713"> It is really unfortunate, as Deputy Ardagh said, that they are here before us today in a reactive way. That is not the way we want to do our work. Unfortunately, CHI has been at the centre of a controversy which involved the implantation of unapproved products in children. It is involved in controversy relating to surgery that may not have been required or was not required for children. It has also been at the centre of the controversy regarding waiting lists and the National Treatment Purchase Fund, which, as Deputy Geoghegan said, has gone on to have broader consequences. There is a broader question about governance, which I will give witnesses a moment to think about. I will return to that question at the end. We have to get CHI right to ensure it is not before this committee again in a reactive way. Like other Deputies have highlighted, that is achieved through transparency. The message for the board of CHI, which is not here, is that when issues come before it, it has an obligation to inform the other partners it works with, such as the HSE, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the NTPF and so on. </p>

          <p eId="para_718">I can clarify that. There were originally 2,259 children involved. The children who had surgery in Crumlin hospital, bar one patient, were deemed to have compliant surgery, for want of a better word. That consists of 446 children. The only requirement there is that they are followed up to skeletal maturity, until their bones fully mature, which is a routine practice. That is being done in a normal outpatient activity. The remainder of the children are being seen through a multidisciplinary team clinical review to establish the status of the children’s hips now. That involves Temple Street and Cappagh children. Subsequent to that will be this expert panel. </p>

          <p eId="para_728">I understand why Deputy McAuliffe is asking me this question because there was a suggestion in one of the media articles that this was a driving factor. When that came to my attention, through hospital inpatient enquiry, HIPE, data, we were able to analyse the fact that in one of our institutions, 25% of those patients were private and in the other institution, 26% of patients were private. Under the old contract, consultants are allowed to do between 20% to 30% of their activity as private work, depending on the type of contract they were on. Based on those data, there is no suggestion this was done for financial gain. There was a philosophy-----</p>

          <p eId="para_742">It is down to our process. It is about the adherence to our MOU. I might bring my personal experience into this from managing Drogheda hospital for five years. Any initiative that came on my desk that was over and above what we normally asked consultants to do in a core working week, I would have reviewed their work schedules with the clinical director before I would ever request any NTPF activity to be carried out within the hospital. I would have assumed that was happening. I see Mr. Kelly is nodding there. That is what should be happening. We must max out what is happening in core hours. Mr. Gloster alluded to that many times yesterday and I completely concur. </p>

Apart from the adherence to the MOU, it is my intention now, following my national assurance audit, that if there are any further NTPF initiatives in relation to insourcing - insourcing only - I will write directly to the CEOs and the general managers of those organisations to ask them, before we approve in principle that agreement, to provide me with further assurance that this is all being done out of core hours and in line with the national financial regulations.</p>

In your opening statement, Mr. Gallagher, you say that the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, first learned of the internal CHI report outlining the misuse of NTPF money at CHI. Do you stand over that comment? Is that an established fact, in your view, that there was a misuse of the funds?</p>

The following day I liaised with Ms Nugent and we had a conversation in relation to the issue. I made a request on the Tuesday for the report or for the part that pertained to the NTPF so that we could get an overview. Unfortunately, Ms Nugent was not able to release that. At that stage, I wrote to her to say I was going to stop all insourcing until I got an idea of what we were talking about.</p>

They seemed to be predominantly operational and, as I said, we put somebody in to work with them specifically. She came back and said there was more to this and that there were long-standing issues, particularly around team dynamics and unprofessional behaviours that warranted exploration from a HR perspective. That is why we assigned a specialist from HR and operations, because we knew they were connected. That is what led to the review. We agreed the terms of reference with the team of consultants and asked the staff to be open with us because we knew there were issues and we wanted to address them. That was the important trust matter and I think that is where we actually gained their trust, because we acted. We followed up with the HR processes, put in the management intervention plan, addressed the patient safety issues, reported it to the board and took the issues up to the HSE. We did not bring the report itself because we wanted to maintain confidentiality. I can confidently say that was a better-----</p>

          <p eId="para_964">In her evidence earlier, Ms Hardiman said that two contracts equal a contract of indefinite duration. That is not absolutely the case. It is not an absolute employment right. Because she has gone on the record, I just want to make sure that we are clarifying that. There would not have needed to be a dispute that gave rise to Ms Hardiman having €100,000 in legal fees if her position was not disputed.</p>

The Act that established CHI states that the Minister has to give consent. The Government policy is that a CEO of a non-commercial State body can do five years and no more than a second term. That is the policy position the Minister was quite right to apply and the board accepted it, so we just needed to resolve the issue then, which was a contractual matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_1022">To be honest, there was an acceptance across the board and organisation that all these issues were being addressed, that they had been brought to the fore and put into a process and that we got the support of the HSE to address some key concerns and issues. This is a team that actually is in a much better place and has done some great innovative work, particularly looking at the model of care. The way in which that team have turned themselves around in those roles has to be commended.</p>

          <p eId="para_1068">I wrote to the NTPF, and it was not to single it out as I wrote to all State bodies and entities. It has been a very fruitful exercise. Essentially, many of the State bodies have not been publishing their data, the NTPF included. The data may be there but it has not been published on the NTPF website. I appreciate the NTPF coming back and emailing me to commit to publishing this data, which is very important. Where I am going with my question is as follows. Based on prompt payment data, about €345 million may have been spent within the NTPF over the last few years. I am asking this because if no purchase order was published, it leads me to believe one of two things. Either all of the sums or all of the individual payments are less than €20,000, so they fall outside the remit, or else they are just not being published.</p>

          <p eId="para_1082">Whether it is a company or an individual, it is somebody. There is always a Pareto effect. There is a disproportionate winner out of any outcome. Somebody is getting the most amount of money out of the NTPF, although they may be providing the most amount of services. I will explain what I am trying to get at. The NTPF gets the money from the Government and the NTPF hands the money to the hospitals. I do not know right now who benefited significantly from the NTPF and CHI does not know.</p>

          <p eId="para_1084">I want a list of who the highest earners were from the NTPF right down to the bottom. I know it can tell me which hospitals got the most but I want every hospital to tell me who got the money, for what procedures and how much. That is the governance issue for the NTPF as well. It should look for that back off the hospitals and ask them, since it gave them, say, €20 million or €100 million, where did that go?</p>
          <p eId="para_1085"> I apologise if I have gone slightly over time but this is very important. Ms Nugent referred to overtime and said it goes out in payroll as overtime. If I am a consultant working in a hospital and I decide that I will take on ten surgeries on a Saturday, is that coming into my normal pay packet as overtime?</p>

          <p eId="para_1086">If they have fulfilled their core hours first. In relation to the NTPF, we only get paid when the activity is done. It is literally per patient. There is no way that we can get paid if we have not done the activity. In the same way, the nurse, the doctor or the admin person cannot get paid unless they have done the hours, and there is a process for claiming overtime.</p>

          <p eId="para_1087">It may be helpful to understand that there seem to be two models for insourcing. One is as described in CHI, where individual staff members are paid overtime and if there are other expenses, they are covered as part of the normal expenditure of the hospital, but there is also the situation where there are companies that are contracted to provide services. Some of those were mentioned yesterday, I understand, by the chief executive of the HSE. He specifically mentioned two cases in Limerick where there were consultants who have companies that are paid for.</p>
          <p eId="para_1088"> A second point to bear in mind is that there are two sources of funding for insourcing. One is the NTPF but there is also access to care, which is funding within the HSE.</p>

          <p eId="para_1089">I apologise as I know I am over my time. Are any related party checks performed on companies that are paid to consultants who are already employed within the hospital structure? For example, a consultant is employed in the hospital and that consultant simultaneously has a company. Is that in conflict with their contract? Is that a conflict of interest?</p>

          <p eId="para_1092">There was an ask to complete a survey by tomorrow. We had submitted all of the payments to third parties under the access to care initiatives. As a result of that, a questionnaire came back to us asking if we could confirm, for all these companies, that there is no common director or common employees, and we were able to confirm that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1093"> To go back to the question, under access to care, companies come in to undertake work and our employees may sign up to work with them. They would receive a payment in relation to that, not from us, but from that external company in that approved process.</p>

Deputy Geoghegan made reference to what was effectively in dispute and why it took so long. I do not think it just cost €120,000. It sounds as though it potentially cost a lot more. Finally, I go back to something I want to clarify so I am 100% clear in my own head. It is the individual or individuals who were not deemed suitable for regular work but were deemed suitable for out-of-hours work. Reference was made to potential nighttime calls and so on.

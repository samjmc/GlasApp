          <p eId="para_9">Generally, I would say from my experience as committee Chair that we should do everything possible that we can do in public session and only should revert to private session where there is an exact reason. There is no reason we cannot do the preliminary part of our work at this stage and the conclusion in public session. The draft minutes of the meeting of 19 February have been circulated. Are these minutes from the last meeting agreed? Agreed.</p>

          <p eId="para_10">The second item in my notes for today is that the committee has one EU proposal listed for consideration. Members should be aware that in accordance with procedure, the committee will take its decision on the EU proposal in public session following an initial consideration of the proposal in private session. The reason it is in private session is we have Oireachtas officials who will give us information. We will have our discussion and if, in public session, people want to clarify some of those points among the committee members but not with the Oireachtas staff they can. Members are free to reiterate some of the points in public session.</p>
          <p eId="para_11"> Members have received the combined briefing note that was circulated in the advance of the meeting. Including in the combined briefing note is the secretariat's advice note, explaining the legislative proposal and the subsidiarity aspects of this proposal. By way of clarification, I might ask whether that secretariat note will be available to the public. Is it published after this meeting? Our discussion, however, will be in public session.</p>
          <p eId="para_12"> Members will have an opportunity to ask questions after the proposal is explained in private session. For clarity, I inform members that any decision made today by the committee on subsidiarity aspects of this proposal will not prohibit Oireachtas committees from scrutinising this proposal in detail at a future date. I will ask the policy clerk in a moment to outline the proposal. I say that because we are given the go-ahead at EU level to proceed with discussions. The date by which they wanted to hear from the Parliament has just about elapsed.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">That is why they wanted to hear from us. However, as this proposal is not due to be implemented until 2027, the line committee will be free, if it so chooses at a later date, to examine this in further detail. We are allowing the process to proceed at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> We will now go into private session. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>

          <p eId="para_15">There is one issue for decision on the agenda of the Select Committee on Subsidiarity (European Union Legislative Scrutiny) today. I remind Deputies that any decision made today will not prohibit an Oireachtas committee from scrutinising this proposal in detail at a future date. Therefore, in respect of COM (2025) 38 regarding an amendment to the central securities depository regulation, it is proposed that on that basis, there are no apparent subsidiarity concerns. This proposal does not warrant further scrutiny by this committee at this time. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> Depending on when the committees are formed, an issue may come before this committee in early April. There is a deadline of early April for an environment, climate and communications issue. It is a proposal relating to a regulation of the European Parliament and European Council amending Regulation 2017/1938 as regards the role of gas storage for securing gas supplies ahead of the winter season. It may come to this committee if the environment committee is not <i>in situ</i> to take it. I am saying that to committee members by the way. If the environment committee is in place, it will deal with the issues.</p>

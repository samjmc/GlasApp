          <p eId="para_12">Apologies have been received from Senator Tom Clonan. I remind members of the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex. Members of the committee attending the meeting remotely must do so from within the precincts of Leinster House. This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where the Parliament has chosen to sit, and that is Leinster House in this regard. Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if a member's statement is potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, I will direct him or her to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that he or she complies with any such direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_13"> As this is only our second meeting and there are new members here who could not make the previous meeting, I welcome everybody here today. Hopefully, we can work collectively and collegiately over the next couple of years.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> The first item on the agenda is the nomination of Leas-Chathaoirleach. Please note that the election for the position of Leas-Chathaoirleach may be carried out in private or if members wish, we can continue in public session, whatever they prefer. Members are happy that we remain in public session. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_15"> As agreed at the first meeting of the committee, one nomination for the position of Leas-Chathaoirleach was received, which was for Senator Margaret Murphy O'Mahony. I now invite any other nominations for the position of Leas-Chathaoirleach. As there is only one nomination, I put the question: "That Senator Margaret Murphy O'Mahony be elected Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Joint Committee on Disability Matters". Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> I declare Senator Margaret Murphy O'Mahony elected as Leas-Chathaoirleach. I congratulate the new Leas-Chathaoirleach and invite her to say a few words. </p>

          <from>Senator Margaret Murphy O'Mahony<recordedTime time="2025-05-21T09:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_17">I thank the Cathaoirleach and my fellow committee members for their support, as well as those who nominated me. I give my word that I will do my best and will work with the Chair and everybody. The good thing about this committee is that all the members looked to be on it. That is a great start. On other committees people are put on as aguisíní, or last-minute additions. Everyone looked to be on this committee and that is a tús maith. I look forward to working with all of the members.</p>

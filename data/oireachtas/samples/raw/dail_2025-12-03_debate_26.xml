          <p eId="para_11">Apologies have been received from Deputy Réada Cronin.</p>
          <p eId="para_12"> At the outset, I advise members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings. Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_13"> The first item on the agenda is agreeing the minutes. Are the minutes of the meeting of 26 November, which have been circulated, agreed? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> Last week, I proposed we look at the reported judicial review proceedings in relation to the MetroLink project. In the interim, we have been informed the accelerating infrastructure task force report is due to be announced today. We had hoped to meet with the task force on 10 December, as this will be a core part of the committee's work, but this will not be possible until the January deadline. The Minister who chaired the task force is not available next week due to Dáil commitments. We will meet the task force very early in January.</p>
          <p eId="para_15"> Since we have not invited or confirmed any guests, I propose that we use next week's window as an opportunity to hold a meeting in private session to prepare our 2026 work programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">We know we have a lot of suggestions for meetings on procurement issues and disability access, as well as requests to meet with bodies such as the OPW, Bord na Móna, EirGrid and Ministers with line responsibilities for the national development plan action plan. This could be a good opportunity to take this work. Is it agreed that we will have that meeting the next day? Agreed. We will have the meeting the next day, but it will be in private session. Basically, it is concerned with the plan or work programme for next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_17"> Members will have received a copy of the invitation in relation to correspondence from the Tennessee state representative, Mr. Dennis Powers, this morning inviting the committee to attend the 2026 State of the State address in early February of next year, with the exact date to be confirmed. As the members will know, we have not drawn down any of our 2025 travel budget, so I am proposing that we accept the invitation as a unique opportunity to visit a state that is now investing heavily in infrastructure, including well over $1 billion in 2025 in housing, transportation, energy, education, conservation and agriculture. The state has a growing population of 7.2 million people as of last year and is tackling similar infrastructure delivery problems to those we have in Ireland, particularly in the energy sector. The invitation is also being issued to our colleagues in Stormont, as well as State agencies involved in trade. I recognise this as an opportunity for good collaboration.</p>
          <p eId="para_18"> Under the committee travel rules, we have the capacity to send up to three members, including the committee Chair. I am proposing that any member who wishes to be considered email the secretariat by next Tuesday. Generally speaking, travelling delegations should be reflective of the make-up of the committee and members, where possible, but this is not always the case in respect of which members are selected. In this regard, I will ask the secretariat to prepare a travel estimate and we can discuss this further at our meeting next week, but I am seeking approval in principle today. Is this agreed? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> What I am really saying is that, as Chairperson, I am travelling and then there is a maximum of two others.</p>

          <p eId="para_21">Yes, whatever. We are asking the members of the committee to let the secretariat know by next Tuesday. We will then make a decision at Wednesday's meeting of who the two members who will accompany the Chair will be. The reason I say this is that there is no definitive rule between Government and Opposition. We will try to reach a consensus next Wednesday, depending on who is offering. Maybe no one will want to travel. Let us get the names in of who is interested, but we will have to try to reach a consensus at next Wednesday's meeting. This is Tennessee's State of the State address and it normally happens on the first Monday of February, which is 2 February 2026, but there will not be confirmation of that until the new year, and it could be 9 February, which is the following Monday. If it is 2 February, then that is the Monday that is the St. Brigid's Day bank holiday here, so the Dáil would not be sitting on the Monday or Tuesday anyway. The event is on the Monday, so we would probably want to be there on the Sunday with a view to being there on the Monday. We might use the Tuesday and Wednesday to see infrastructure, with a view to coming home Wednesday night. I estimate we would be away three to four nights. The Dáil will be meeting on the Wednesday and Thursday, so if there is a pairing situation, we will have to look at it at that stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_26">What I will say is that those interested should put their names in and we will try to reach a consensus next Wednesday. Since we were set up, this committee has not travelled anywhere. I do not have the budget figures in front of me, but we certainly can be accommodated as a committee with a trip. It is unusual. The state's population is a bit bigger than Ireland's and it is facing the exact same issues. We will ask to look at some project that has been successfully completed recently or works under way and see if we can learn anything from the American methods of doing work. That is generally agreed, so we will suspend to allow our witnesses to come in.</p>

          <p eId="para_27">The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the role of the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, in relation to supporting the delivery of high-quality national infrastructure, including those projects set out in the national development plan. I am pleased to welcome from the Commission for Regulation of Utilities: Mr. Jim Gannon, commissioner and chairperson, Mr. Fergal Mulligan, commissioner, Dr. Karen Kavanagh, director of networks and economic regulation, Ms Karen Trant, director of customer policy and protection, and Dr. Phil Hemmingway, director of decarbonisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.

It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> I remind members they will be afforded a six-minute speaking slot for questions and answers, with a second chance to contribute if they so wish.</p>
          <p eId="para_30"> I now invite Mr. Jim Gannon to make the opening statement for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_10">
          <from> Mr. Jim Gannon<recordedTime time="2025-12-03T15:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_31">I thank the committee for inviting us today. As this is a new Dáil session and the first time that the CRU has appeared before this committee, I would like to note how much we value this engagement and the opportunity to brief members on our work. Given the notice to prepare for this meeting, we are focusing on the topics asked by the committee but are happy to answer questions in other areas where possible. We also look forward to future engagements on specific topics where we will be more than happy to provide deep dives for the committee should they come up. I would also refer members to the briefing note we prepared in support of the opening statement and to our strategic plan for 2025 to 2027, which provides more general background information on the work and priorities of the CRU.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> The CRU plays a vital role in shaping Ireland's response to the climate challenge and ensuring that essential energy and water services are delivered efficiently and safely and in the interest of the public. The CRU is Ireland's independent energy, energy safety and water regulator. We actively serve the public interest by regulating the provision of these services to Irish homes and businesses. As such our work impacts every Irish home, business and citizen. We strive to ensure safe, secure and sustainable energy and water supplies for all. </p>
          <p eId="para_33"> The CRU's role in energy is to maintain security of supply, ensure efficient network delivery and promote competition and innovation in the generation and supply of electricity and supply of natural gas. As part of this role, the CRU jointly regulates the all-island wholesale single electricity market, the SEM, with its counterpart in Northern Ireland, the Utility Regulator. The principal objective of the single electricity market committee is to protect the interests of consumers of electricity wherever appropriate by promoting effective competition between persons engaged in, or in commercial activities connected with, the sale or purchase of electricity through the single electricity market.</p>
          <p eId="para_34"> Protecting public safety and the prevention of major accidents in Ireland's energy sector is also a role assigned to the CRU. This extends from upstream oil and gas activities, through to the delivery of the registered gas installer and registered electrical contractor programmes. Members might be aware of the recent fire at George's Dock in the IFSC. This is the type of incident that the CRU is responsible for investigating with other relevant authorities. </p>
          <p eId="para_35"> As an economic regulator for public water and wastewater services, the CRU sets targets and monitors the performance of Uisce Éireann in delivering services and investment in infrastructure in a cost-efficient manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_36"> We are integral to facilitating Ireland's climate transition and shaping the regulatory landscape to support Ireland's energy and water infrastructure delivery, security and decarbonisation targets.</p>
          <p eId="para_37"> The CRU and our staff are proud of its work and impact to date. Some recent highlights this particular committee may be interested in include: the publication of a draft determination on the price review 6, PR6, framework that will underpin a record investment of up to €19 billion in Ireland's electricity infrastructure from 2026 to 2030 with a final determination due in coming weeks; the introduction of new regulatory decisions to support hybrid electricity connection projects and continued progress in this area; upcoming publication of decision on a new electricity connection policy for large energy users, data centres, providing a pathway for connections to the Irish electricity system; key regulatory decisions on the Greenlink interconnector revenue process and initial assessment of the proposed Mares interconnector; various regulatory decisions on grid connection and charging for offshore wind, including - critically - the addition of a route to grid for projects that were unsuccessful in obtaining support in Ireland's first offshore support auction, providing them with a route to market and route to development; setting the foundations for Ireland's future offshore price controls and incentives for the delivery of infrastructure to develop a more resilient electricity system; publication of a draft determination on the revenue control 4 framework that will underpin a record investment of up to €13.6 billion in Ireland's water and wastewater infrastructure from 2025 to 2029; and publication of a consultation on a review of the biomethane grid connection policy to support the development of Ireland's biomethane sector while maintaining appropriate protections for consumers and aligning with national decarbonisation targets.</p>
          <p eId="para_38"> In an increasingly complex global and national environment, the challenges and importance of our work are increasing. The regulatory frameworks required for the integration of both offshore and onshore renewable generation are significant, as are the ongoing infrastructure development requirements in the electricity, gas and water networks, as well as increased needs in our energy safety mandate.</p>
          <p eId="para_39"> To meet these needs, the CRU has grown its resources and headcount in the last two years from 113 to 186. We are transforming as an organisation to better deliver and empower consumers, support policy development, support infrastructure delivery and private sector investment and deliver effective regulation but we are severely constrained in terms of capacity and capability. We are in ongoing dialogue with Departments to address this challenge and significantly expand our workforce to meet the growing needs of society and the environment in which we operate.</p>
          <p eId="para_40"> We look forward to continuing to work closely with the Government and of course this committee to achieve our collective ambitions for economic growth, the climate transition and the protection of consumers. </p>
          <p eId="para_41"> This concludes our opening statement; we are happy to take questions. </p>

          <p eId="para_42">I thank Mr. Gannon for his opening statement. Before I got to the Vice Chair, Deputy Neville, I want to put two points on the record. Today, the Government published its accelerating infrastructure report or action plan. We will not discuss that in detail. Mr. Gannon may not have had an opportunity to fully review it yet as it was only launched today. The committee will come back to that very soon.</p>
          <p eId="para_43"> Second, I thank Mr. Gannon for his role as a regulator. I just want to make a comment about the issue of regulators. We look forward to seeing what is in this document about regulators. I saw information published very recently that in 1920, approximately 100 years ago, we had 25 regulators in Ireland covering everything. Seventy years after that, by 1990, we had about 50 regulators. Today we have 100 regulators. All are independent. All have their own strategy and statement of strategy. All are with their own brief. It might be a theme in this document of how all the regulators work together. Obviously everyone is independent but many projects involve different regulators. That is something that the committee is interested in its work. It is not specifically because the CRU is here today but as part of our work we are considering the individual 100 regulators out there today. Obviously they do valuable work but is there any way of co-ordinating some of this activity with their Departments because they are all under some Department somewhere along the line? The comment I am making about the number of regulators is that it is part of the problem, as far as I am concerned but it is not specifically directed at the CRU - it just happens to be here today when this document came out. I am just putting that comment on the record for us as a committee to consider carefully in our work over the coming year in relation to the number of regulators and how they help, improve, possibly delay or do not improve the infrastructure development and operations of the various utilities. </p>

          <p eId="para_46">In line with European policy, Ireland has a deregulated retail market for electricity and gas. The CRU does not set the price that retail suppliers would set, however, there are component parts of the bill that we do regulate. For example, with the networks component that drives some prices, we set annual tariffs that are then passed on to suppliers that are then passed on to consumers. That is one part of the bill. Another part of the bill is the PSO levy that supports renewables development that the Government provides for renewable electricity generators. We review what the level of that should be on an annual basis. That is another piece on top.</p>

We get caught up in the money side of things. How do we ensure we are getting a bang for our buck here - performance-related pay, almost - from the likes of EirGrid or whoever will be delivering this grid? Do our mainland stakeholders, like Bord na Móna, have any role here? I gave the example last week of the pipeline from the mid-west to Dublin.

          <p eId="para_136">It is very important for us that when we produce price controls or price reviews on these five-year timelines, we talk about the investment but not just about the numbers. We talk about the outcomes, the kilometres, the wastewater treatment plants, the water pipelines and the leakage reduction. I will pass to my colleagues, Mr. Mulligan and Dr. Kavanagh, to describe that in a little more detail.</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_104">
          <from> Dr. Karen Kavanagh<recordedTime time="2025-12-03T16:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_137">As we do our revenue control, part of the reason it takes so long is because it is not just the cost assessment, where we look at historical costs and the forward costs; we are also looking at setting the regulatory framework. For PR6, there are four components. The first one is looking at how we manage uncertainty throughout the period. We have our reporting framework. We have our performance incentives, where we look at particular areas that we focus the company's attentions on and at delivering specific customer outcomes. Then we have the reporting structures as well. This package, which we call the agile investment and monitoring framework, is how we hold companies to account over the period. Particularly in terms of managing uncertainty through the PR6 period, we are looking at setting a baseline for allowances. Over that period we will allow the company to request re-openers, as they deliver and as they spend the money on certain aspects. On other aspects, things like housing, we will have mechanistic drivers, so the money will ratchet up in terms of the volume of delivery. We also have an enhanced reporting framework and monitoring for PR6. We have identified things like 36 delivery obligations. We have identified 29 priority transmission projects where we will have quarterly reporting on each of them along with some of the other key metrics. We will also have annual reporting. Some of this will feed into our incentive framework, where we have financial penalties and incentives for the companies, EirGrid and ESB Networks, as I said, on a range of key metrics. They are the ones that really matter to customers. In terms of customer satisfaction and reliability, we will report on all of those annually.</p>
          <p eId="para_138"> For PR6, we are also proposing to have a dashboard where we will pick key metrics for specific things that are of particular importance to customers, stakeholders and policy makers and we can give regular updates on all of those. For RC4 on the water side, we have a performance assessment framework at the moment but we are also looking at enhanced reporting around that. This would provide additional metrics around security of supply and additional reporting and also a dashboard. We are also in consultation on that. We would encourage any feedback on what is useful and meaningful reporting on some of those projects.</p>

          <p eId="para_139">On the Deputy's question on where the €19 billion is going, we will in our report publish all the detail of what it has been invested in. This will include the upgrading of substations, the number of poles being replaced around the country and the winter resilience plan in the west of Ireland, which will mean a spend of between €500 million and €600 million on forestry work. We are going to publish all the detail about all the transmission network cables that are going to be built in Dublin, Cork and Limerick. All of this detail will be in our report, which will be published before Christmas, so that everybody knows exactly what is being done. Between them, EirGrid and the ESB are managing about 570 projects over the next five to ten years. This includes projects that are currently halfway through the project delivery stage, projects that have not yet started and projects that are coming to an end. In our PR6 documents, we have outlined all of those. There are 29 huge projects. Of the 570 projects, 29 of them make up probably 60% of the capital cost. As Dr. Kavanagh was saying, we monitor them every quarter with ESB Networks and EirGrid. Under PR6, people will be glad to know that our reporting framework will have a much more detailed reporting framework on delivery, which will address questions about project schedules and if a plan changes, why it is changing. We will bring that to all the respective stakeholders, who are going to be heavily engaged with the Departments, including the Department of Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation. The guidelines are about the transparency of delivery of these projects by our utility companies. As regulator, we are now playing a massive role in getting the quarterly information from these utilities on what they said they would deliver for the money they are getting from consumers, business and the Exchequer, in the case of Uisce Éireann. Holding them to account on delivery is a huge part of our role as regulator. This information will be published regularly and annually so that people and the Oireachtas Members can see if they have delivered as they promised they would.</p>

The energy credits were brought in at a time of crisis and we think they were an appropriate and proportionate response at the time.

          <p eId="para_147">Okay, I might move on because I am short on time. A recent report by the International Energy Agency found that residential electricity prices in Ireland are three times higher than the wholesale cost. I understand that the electricity and gas suppliers have hedging strategies, where they purchase electricity and gas supplies for periods of time in advance and the aim then is to smooth out price spikes and dips in the wholesale market. With households facing repeated price increases, there are legitimate questions to be answered about what role the energy regulator is playing to ensure there is no price-gouging. I am interested in understanding what role the CRU plays in auditing the hedging strategies of energy suppliers.</p>

          <p eId="para_149">If I take the hedging strategy piece first, currently we can ask any supplier to provide information under their licence. In the past, when we looked at the hedging strategies they were employing, we found that some of the four biggest suppliers during the crisis did provide that highly commercially sensitive information, but they were willing to do that. We issued a report to the Minister on foot of that analysis. At that point, there was a lack of understanding of how the hedging strategies were working and why the wholesale price and the drop in the wholesale gas price was not feeding through to retail prices quickly. That is because the suppliers here take a prudent approach to profiling their customer base, and that is, they engage in hedging strategies to smooth out volatility in the market and the fact is we do have a peaky market. The hedging strategies smooth out the volatility - it is a forwards contract - so there is a lag before the customer will see the reduction in the retail price.</p>

          <p eId="para_151">Yes it is. I do not think there is price-gouging. I have heard that allegation on a number of occasions but there is no evidence for us as a regulator to indicate that. We have carried out investigations - let us call them that - into those. In 2017 we carried out a review of competition in the market to see that it was adding value for customers. The market had been liberalised in 2010 or 2011. </p>
          <p eId="para_152">We are now going to repeat that exercise and we are going to look at the structures. We will look at the retail market to see if it is offering competition and delivering for customers. The other part of that is around supplier costs. Going back to 2017, the supplier retail part of that bill was somewhere in the region of 9%. We will see what that make-up is in 2016. I do not believe there is price-gouging. </p>

          <p eId="para_153">The opening statement indicated that under the PR6 determination, domestic customers are going to see an increase in the network charge component of their bills. The same network charges for data centres and other large energy users are to decrease. What is that rationale behind this decision? Is it the case that the CRU is following Government policy to give preferential treatment to data centres and other large energy users over domestic customers?</p>

          <p eId="para_154">No, there is no policy. In terms of how we allocate costs for domestic and non-domestic customers, there is no disparity in terms of the treatment. The costs are allocated based on a methodology which is more than 20 years old and is due to be reviewed. In terms of PR6, at the time we were estimating that for domestic customers it was approximately €30 over the five years of PR6. The reason large energy users were seeing a much smaller increase and, in some cases, a decrease is the way in which large energy users are exposed to transmission tariffs. They are largely collected as a transmission network. Because of the security of supply costs incurred over the cost of PR5, they saw a much bigger increase in their costs over PR5, approximately 175% over the period, compared with domestic customers, who saw an increase of about 45% in the same period.</p>

          <p eId="para_156">We are acutely conscious of the impact that any increase on households would have in terms of this investment. As such, through our PR6 process, we try to minimise the costs that are passed through to customers. We challenge the network companies to ensure that only those costs that are absolutely justified and efficient are included into the tariffs. We also ensure that we are setting a baseline for PR6 so that only as costs are incurred are they allowed through to the tariffs. This is to ensure that we are not front-loading costs on customers.</p>

          <p eId="para_178">I am happy to come on this. In the latter stages of the recent crisis, after Russia invaded Ukraine, we produced a report at the request of the Minister, which we also published openly, and issued to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action. This showed how hedging occurred during that period and how it protected the consumer from the initial price spikes. It also showed how, when that flowed through to the retail side, the decline happened equally in a smooth manner. What would be helpful is if we offer to circulate that report to this committee and then engage in more detailed discussion-----</p>

What Ms Trant said is quite important, in that in our work plan for 2026, we have two key activities.

          <p eId="para_182">I will come back to that in one second. The second work plan task we will be performing next year is issuing a call for evidence, and this is to look more explicitly at arrears and debt with consumers and how we address and understand that, and how transparently we report it. Separately, we will examine how offers are made in the market to consumers to make sure they are transparent and clear, and consumers can really shop around for the most effective price. There are two specific actions tackling this in the work plan for 2026 that will result in transparent reports being published. We will be have to come back to the Deputy on those.</p>
          <p eId="para_183"> In terms of the price cap approach, which is taken in the UK, that is not a regulated price where they literally set the tariff for consumers; it is that a cap has been introduced. The experience in the UK was mixed on that during the crisis where a number of suppliers went out of business. A supplier of last resort mechanism had to be brought in, and the cost of those supply companies going out of business because they were capped at how much they could recover from consumers, resulted in their failure. That then resulted in the costs of those failures and transfer of consumers being spread around to other consumers. With each intervention like that there are pros but also cons. Some of the cons of the price cap approach were experienced in the UK and very clearly so during the crisis, when significant challenges were experienced.</p>

          <p eId="para_185"> In relation to the commission's work plan for 2026 and the call for evidence of debt, pardon my ignorance of the intricacies of the legislation that underpins the commission's agency, but in terms of anecdotal evidence and discussion in the Dáil Chamber and constituents’ lived experience of debt and rising prices, how quickly can it pivot? Is it bound to a legislative-based timetable for its work plan, or is it resource-dependent? We can tell our witnesses around the table that there is an experience but it is in the commission's work plan for 2026. Can things move more expeditiously in that regard?</p>

          <p eId="para_186">I thank the Deputy. Yes, in that we have based our current business plan on the resources we have now, rather than future resources if we get them. We will work as quickly as we can on that piece of work. The plan is to get something out early in the new year. We are looking at a number of areas within that call for evidence and to hear from all of our stakeholders. We engage with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Money Advice &amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, and the other NGOs, but this is about how best we can engage customers who are in distress to engage with their suppliers and to enter into repayment plans. We see there is an anomaly there. There are high arrears but very low numbers in repayment plans with suppliers. We do not know what is causing that. It could well be that customers are entering into repayment plans that are not sustainable or reflective of their income. They may be slightly panicked because of the threat of disconnection. We do not know, I am surmising, but that is all to come from the call for evidence, and we want to hear all of that. I do not think it is unique. The UK is dealing with significant levels of arrears.</p>
          <p eId="para_187"> On that point, we have heard the figure of 300,000 electricity customers in arrears. We gathered that information as a regulator to understand competition on the market. When suppliers are carrying that level of debt, it is a cost overall to all electricity consumers. From the Department's point of view, it is trying to look at customers who are in distress. I will not use the word “vulnerable” because it has a particular legal definition, but customers in arrears and in distress. That 300,000 figure includes customers who could be in debt for €10 and who may have missed their last bill for no particular reason. What we are trying to do is narrow that down and give that information a more granular use. Therefore, we are looking at more than 90 days, which reduces that figure of 300,000 down to 180,000 electricity customers and reduces the number of gas customers. That is more meaningful. It means that targeted approach is potentially achievable if we are able to look at those who are in continued arrears and distress. That is where we are going. That is the direction of travel. We have said it in the past, that one-for-all - I use that term very loosely but that sort of non-targeted approach – is really not ideal and it means that those who really do need it are potentially missed in the longer term.</p>

          <p eId="para_188">As to Deputy Toole’s first point, when we go out for a call for evidence, sometimes we will pick up on actions that we can take in the short term. We have shown in the past that, let us say for infrastructure development and delivery for hybrid projects, which is where renewable generation and batteries can use the same infrastructure far more efficiently, effectively and cheaply for consumers and make a better business case, instead of waiting until we had done the full programme of work to make all three decisions, we have said the first part of this is far more important to do quickly. In our first call for evidence of effort around that, we said it is more important to make this change quickly and parallel than wait for the full programme to come through. Where we find things that we can act on more quickly, we will not wait until the final end-point of all of that scope of work, to do it all. If we think we can do something quickly that will have an impact for consumers, we will do that and we will be agile and will respond to that. Again, that is to provide more efficiency and more agile regulation and to hit the important things as quickly as we can. I wanted to say that out loud.</p>

          <p eId="para_189">We probably can help with encouraging people to engage with the providers for the provision of a payment plan. In the remaining few seconds, if I may, does the commission have any jurisdiction, oversight or otherwise on the renewable market and the selling on at the different stages that can occur? For example, I am in County Meath, which has very high-density solar farm planning applications. I believe we have seven out of the nine that are active in the country. What I have noticed is a trend, which will have an impact on pricing ultimately. Correct me if I am wrong but where planning permission is granted, the entity may be sold. If it is successful at the auction, there may be another sale and I am fearful that this type of behaviour that I have witnessed may be contributing to elevated prices at the other end. Is that a space the commission is aware of or involved in or would be keeping an eye on going forward?</p>

          <p eId="para_190">I am happy to pass that over to my colleagues but it is something that naturally occurs in many jurisdictions, namely, that people bring a project through to development, obtain planning or authorisation to construct or licence to generate and perhaps be successful in an auction, and would then sell on that asset to someone who would construct and then sell it on as an operator. </p>
          <p eId="para_191">That sort of transaction is natural and rational. I will ask my colleagues to speak about the authorisations and a bit about the RESS side.</p>

          <p eId="para_192">Licensing sits within my brief. We see change of control applications from people who have licences or authorisations to construct. Very few authorisations to construct go through change of control. It is usually when they get to a licence that they may be, for one reason or another, sold on to another licensee or look for a change of control. I am not sure about the pricing aspect. I do not see any aspect of that so I am not sure how the price would be passed on or elevated, but they operate in the market.</p>

          <p eId="para_194">I do not think we have a particular role when it comes to individual entities bringing a solar or wind farm to a certain point and then selling it. Where we have a role is, for example, in large-scale electricity interconnectors. Two are live at the moment, between the Republic of Ireland and Great Britain. When they are sold, we go through a certification process where we look at the ownership structure of the entity that is buying the interconnector to make sure there are not any conflicts of interests with other assets. However, that would not apply at the level of an individual solar or wind farm or other generation asset.</p>

          <p eId="para_195">Perhaps it would also reassure the Deputy that solar and wind farms that are built on land, that is, onshore, are largely being built by foreign direct investment funds such as pension funds but they are also competing with one another to be profitable. Therefore, competition, which is built up and down the country, will keep the price down. On being afraid of supernormal profits or consumers having to pay an extra premium or price, at the end of the day, there is competition in the solar-renewable area, where these guys have to make a reasonable profit. Again, there is no evidence these guys are coming in and buying wind and solar farms and the price just goes up. In some instances, when investors sell a solar or wind farm, they may not have the finance to keep going and someone may have to step in and buy it. That could even be at a knockdown price, where the person who built it may have lost money. There are many different aspects to what goes on in capital markets. We have seen no evidence that there is an issue there from a consumer point of view.</p>

          <p eId="para_199"> Going back to the big increase in the CRU's resources in two years, that level of increase is significant. Is the CRU at capacity now or is it looking for more resources? How does Mr. Gannon see that panning out in the coming years?</p>

          <p eId="para_200">To be clear, we grew to that size to serve the existing requirements on us from the expansion of policy, new roles and European regulation under which we just must do what comes through, regardless of national policy. What has changed in the past few years is that two or three things have happened. We currently have a number of additional roles we never had before, which have been added or are being added to our brief relating to district heating, a potential new brief as the competent authority for private wires, NIS2, which would make us a cybersecurity authority and regulator for energy assets-----</p>

          <from> Mr. Jim Gannon<recordedTime time="2025-12-03T16:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_202">It is NIS2. It is a regulation under which we would become a cybersecurity regulator for energy infrastructure to ensure the protections are in place and those people are there.</p>
          <p eId="para_203"> It is also in the pipeline for us to take on being the competent authority for critical entities resilience regulator, as for a number of different roles which are all new to us and all require teams and, in certain cases, expertise and competencies we did not have before.</p>
          <p eId="para_204"> On the other side, we have seen a significant increase in the size of the wholesale electricity market and the costs that come through there, so greater effort is required to make it more efficient. Offshore energy generation is new to Ireland and we will be looking at €5 billion worth of a regulated asset base in EirGrid that was not there previously, but could be there in the next six or seven years. We are mandating and ensuring it is delivered in an efficient way and that the right kinds of contracts are in place between EirGrid and others. That is significant.</p>
          <p eId="para_205"> On the safety side, which often does not get discussed, we have the potential introduction of hydrogen and biogas. There has been an increase in incidents recently due to new technologies coming on the market. We also have increases in, as I said, water and electricity infrastructure. Perhaps instead of looking at a particular number of projects in price review, PR5, my colleague, Mr. Mulligan, has noted that we are now looking at 570-odd projects and making sure they are delivered in an efficient way and reported on transparently. We are driving the incentives to make sure these are done in the public interest. Across all our parallel processes, including the supports for those, such as legal, compliance and enforcement, we must make sure that where people are not abiding by their licence conditions or normal market behaviour, we can identify and act on it. All of this must grow.</p>
          <p eId="para_206"> Do not get me wrong, in parallel to that, on the other side we are speeding things up and reducing things. I will be quick about this, but it is important. For authorisations to construct and licences to generate, starting in 2022, we said that for projects below 10 MW in size - a lot of projects were coming through on solar and wind at that time - we would reduce the requirements significantly to make it easier, quicker and more efficient for applicants and we are doing that now.</p>
          <p eId="para_207"> As for connections policy for renewable generators, last year we brought out a totally different process, which speeds up the process for ESB Networks. It has two gates for investors to come through, not just one per annum, so it is much quicker for developers and investors and that speeds up the timeline.</p>
          <p eId="para_208"> Separately, recently on section 39A, we identified there is a sort of doubling up between two of our licences on a consent to operate infrastructure. One is on the safety side and the other is on the gas networks side. We are about to consider taking away one of those to make things more efficient, quicker, less burdensome and less resource intensive and we have already-----</p>

          <p eId="para_212">I would say yes and we are not disguising some of these challenges.</p>
          <p eId="para_213"> On the offshore infrastructure in particular, we have been moving ahead of the critical path for bringing in the offshore wind farms but next year we could see ourselves, with some of our decisions, coming onto the critical path because we just cannot get there quickly enough. It is not extensive consultation periods. It is literally about doing the work to get there.</p>
          <p eId="para_214"> On investment in biomethane, it is capacity where we must, in terms of regulation and policy, bring in a new framework and process to allow these people to connect to the grid. It is just a processing capacity piece. We want the investment to happen and to happen in the right way but that we are able to do it as quickly as possible. There are a number of examples.</p>

          <p eId="para_215">It is about staying ahead of the innovation because this is quite an innovative sector. As our regulator, the CRU has a responsibility to stay ahead of the pace. It is to ensure that is happening. The last thing I want to hear is that someone is not investing or progressing with a project or that a job creation opportunity is lost because the CRU did not have the right or adequate papers. That is where the committee needs to stay in tune about the work the CRU does.</p>
          <p eId="para_216"> The 90 days is a good move to give a more transparent view of where we are and understanding of what the issues are. However, will the CRU include something about disconnections? There is a moratorium now for the winter period, but we need to get a better understanding of the pace of arrears to disconnections so we get a clear idea. I am not trying to be ruthless about it but we need to get an understanding of that as well.</p>

          <p eId="para_218">We want people to engage. Once they engage that process stops. There is no disconnection. If people do not engage that process is almost automated and then 75% of those contacted during that disconnection period engage with the supplier. It is not the ideal scenario. We monitor the disconnections for non-payment of account and they are still very low. We want to see that. Suppliers do not want to do it. We do not want them to do it, and customers do not want them to do it but there has to be an alternative. That is the sort of-----</p>

There will be a dashboard and more frequent and more transparent reporting. It would take out the need for the hard copy PDF report. The data would just be accessible.

          <p eId="para_309">My second question is on a broad thing. I refer to people, ordinary consumers, who want to set their price of electricity and they are paying every month. They have no contract and they want to set a contract. I am talking about electricity here. They can only get a contract for 12 months. Why so short? I know prices cannot be predicted but lots of people would like to enter a contract longer than 12 months. It is a very short contract. </p>

          <p eId="para_313">As Dr. Kavanagh has alluded to, there is a thing called the tariff year where suppliers will know what their costs are, what the tariffs will be and then how to recover that. If it was set out to two years I am not sure, from a commercial point of view, how viable that would be for the suppliers. I am sure they could offer that product. The reality is, from a European perspective, there is a move away from fixed-term contracts. They want a more dynamic and agile-type product on the market. We have issued a paper around that. Dynamic tariffs follow the wholesale prices, therefore it is around what the Deputies were alluding to earlier - that volatility and that spike. </p>

However, instead of it being a single price throughout all of the days, the same price for every time of day, they could have something that is more dynamic. This means it is a little bit more expensive between 4 o'clock until 7 p.m. but the rest gets better.</p>

          <p eId="para_328">The witnesses mentioned the CRU's report to the Oireachtas. I do not want to get into too much detail but I noticed that the levy income is €23 million for electricity, gas is €7 million and water is €2 million. From the CRU's financial statements, it is turning a much bigger surplus from the water side, which is quite small. How does the CRU decide which of the three groups it regulates will be the most profitable? Looking at the electricity, it is turning very little surplus, namely, €110,000 out of €22 million, whereas it is a much bigger surplus for regulating water, as I have just mentioned. How does the CRU decide that should be the case? </p>

          <p eId="para_329">In advance of a given year, we will set our work plan for the year ahead and that would be across gas, electricity, water and energy safety. That then has us look at our budget for those different areas of activity. That budget then feeds through to the levy that we set. We do not target having a surplus by the end of the year. What we try to target is having it as close as we can, without making sure we enter into deficit. In our annual budgeting process, what we attempt to do is to try to ultimately bring that down and down. However, the last number of years have seen us grown in terms of our budget. The level of surplus has increased over the past number of years but in our budget setting process for this coming year, that is now coming to a close, we have sought again to keep it as close as possible to what is required. </p>

          <p eId="para_337">However, it can also involve Uisce Éireann in particular. What is the regulator doing about it? Uisce Éireann is way behind. How much of the regulator's activity is based on water quality as opposed to water quantity? In recent years, I have heard that water quality is getting substantial attention as opposed to the quantity of water. We want both. Let us start on that basis. How does the regulator distinguish between those two areas in terms of its workload? New houses are built, mortgages are ready and everything is done, the ESB is there but Irish Water says the sewage treatment plant is full. Based on what I hear as a TD, the regulator could not possibly be satisfied with how Uisce Éireann is doing its work in this regard. </p>

We will then monitor that over the course of RC3 to see what it is delivering. One of the things we would have found in the last period was that Uisce Éireann was doing very well in terms of water and we expressed some concern on the wastewater side that it was not delivering as quickly as it had committed to and as we would have liked.

          <p eId="para_364">The local authorities have transitioned to Uisce Éireann in the main. There is still a legacy. It will be fully transitioned by 2026 or 2027. Domestic customers are subsidised by the Exchequer so the Cathaoirleach and I as domestic residential customers do not pay a water bill like every other country in Europe. The Exchequer funding is what subsidises Uisce Éireann. That does present a huge regulatory challenge in terms of us fining Uisce Éireann because, ultimately, all we are doing is reducing the Exchequer purse. From the point of view of Uisce Éireann, if we take €40 million or €50 million off it in fines, there is a challenge there insofar as that is €50 million or €20 million less it might have to spend on a water treatment plant. It is not like a shareholder company, private equity company or commercial company that would feel pain in its profit line if we as a regulator fine it so it is weaker than a normal regulatory environment. There is no doubt about that. As a regulator, regulating water in Ireland, given the Exchequer-funded model, is not as strong as it might be in many other jurisdictions. </p>

          <p eId="para_388">Part of that certainly is the work of suppliers relating to the size of the Irish market. In a very small market like ours, where prices on the wholesale side are more volatile, and in a smaller market in general, there are different hedging strategies that suppliers would have to take into account and take on board. In a smaller market, that tends to be more expensive because there is greater volatility on the wholesale side. In addition, in Ireland, as we have discussed previously, there are high levels of arrears at the moment but we have a level of disconnections that is in fact at about the same level as before Covid, so there has not been the level of disconnections that were there. It is not that we are seeking or that we want that, but there is a carrying cost for suppliers where they are not disconnecting people who are in arrears and in debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_389"> To finalise on this, we have stated in this session, and we will come back with more detail on it, that we are exercising two elements of our work plan next year. The first is a competition and competitiveness review of the retail market in Ireland. In the past, with the other Oireachtas joint committee we report to, we have articulated the different bits, including the wholesale price, we have looked at the network tariffs and we have talked about imperfections and capacity mechanism costs and the PSO, that is, other building blocks. This year coming, we are going back to look at competitiveness and competition in the retail space, and that is to look expressly at that gap between wholesale and retail for next year. Then, in parallel, we are going out for a call for evidence to look at arrears, debt and how we contend with those things in our retail market.</p>

          <p eId="para_391">We do not have that data. I will pass to my colleague, Ms Karen Trant. Anecdotally, we understand that it is in the mid-single digits as regards profitability that the retail element of the suppliers would operate at. That is the kind of information we will seek. Separately, what we do have comparative data on, and again we can come back to the committee with this, is comparisons between Ireland's retail prices and European retail prices and, in particular, the Eurostat data, which is the European Commission data, which compares on the basis of purchasing power. It effectively looks at the cost of living in places like Bulgaria versus Ireland and it is the comparative cost of electricity in the jurisdictions-----</p>

          <p eId="para_393">The companies produce regulated accounts. They also produce accounts for the CRO. We went through a supplier-of-last-resort event so we were able to drill down into granular detail into the companies' costs. We know from that exercise that we are talking about 3% to 5%. In the UK it is higher. It is probably in or around 7%. As Commissioner Gannon has said, we will do a review of that supplier cost piece next year. It was done in 2017. We will do it again and see where we are now because we are in a new normal.</p>
          <p eId="para_394"> If I may come back to the Deputy about the IEA piece, that wholesale comparative is the weighted cost of the European wholesale price. It is not our wholesale price. It is not Ireland's wholesale price. Our retail price bobs along with our wholesale price. That wholesale price is artificially deflated because Poland and other countries have a much bigger mixed portfolio of coal, gas, oil and so on, which gives a lower wholesale price. That is why it looks a bit at odds.</p>
          <p eId="para_395"> We look at the Eurostat data, and one area that is not maybe as publicly spoken about is power purchase ability, PPA, of individuals in Ireland. Our standard of living is much higher than other countries, such as Bulgaria, so when you add that into the Eurostat data it brings us down to about the 11th most expensive because of our wages and so on. PPA is probably a more accurate representation of where we are in terms of the costs of electricity and the cost of living.</p>

          <p eId="para_411">Last year there were 30,000 blackouts in terms of electricity delivery, affecting 3 million people. When I saw that figure I was astounded by it. It was received through an FOI request by a journalist. I started to look at this. You go onto the British websites and all that information is readily available, but it is like pulling teeth out of ESB Networks. They are really reticent to deliver any information on that. It is quite a jaw-dropping figure and it does not include, to my understanding, Storm Éowyn. What kind of efforts can the CRU make to make sure that ESB Networks provides up-to-date information to citizens in terms of this in order that we can have a transparent process and that there is a penalty for that happening?</p>

          <p eId="para_413">Customer outages are one of the things we monitor in terms of PR5 as part of the incentive programme, but in PR6 there is huge investment in the grid. There is up to €1 billion going in in terms of network resilience, upgrades and general network rehabilitation. In addition, in terms of the framework, we have performance incentives that are explicitly calling out customer minutes lost, customer outages and all those things that impact customer satisfaction. We will call that out and report on that quarterly as well as annually, and that feeds into the incentive framework, so I suppose-----</p>

          <p eId="para_415">There is some reporting in there at the moment but, as we have tracked through the current process, we have identified some issues and sought additional enhanced monitoring in that regard. It is a recognised issue. It is probably something to be aware of that, as we invest heavily in the grid over the coming years, there will be some disruption. It is an area we really want to keep a focus on. It is not just storms but also some of the outages that have to happen as a result of the investment and the delivery of some of the bigger transmission infrastructure. That drives a certain amount of outages. We have enhanced modelling to see how our customers are being impacted directly. We will be reporting more frequently. It will probably be one of the things that feature on our dashboard.</p>

          <p eId="para_420">I have one last question. It goes back to the Cathaoirleach's questions about water. My understanding is that the CRU's particular regulatory responsibility relates to the financial delivery model of the water systems in Ireland. Is Uisce Éireann living up to its responsibilities in those terms? In Meath, the delivery of water has been an absolute disaster in the last number of years. The town of Trim regularly has no water at all available at nighttime because of difficulties in the system. Ballivor had tankers of water being delivered for months and months because of the systems in the town breaking down. Restaurants and cafés regularly close in Enfield because there is no water available. I know there has been a massive increase in population in Meath, which demands massive infrastructural development, which is in play. The word "accountability" is very elastic. Somebody is accountable to somebody else but accountability means that there is a cost to an individual if the individual does not do his or her job. If there is no cost, there is no accountability in reality. What costs have ever been imposed on Uisce Éireann for the fall-off in delivery of service that happens so often in Meath?</p>

          <p eId="para_421">I will go back to the point that Uisce Éireann is a semi-State body and is primarily funded by the Exchequer. Any profits it makes are reinvested in the network. Profits do not go to any shareholder or private equity company, as they would in other companies. It is a weak framework as regards Uisce Éireann suffering pain as a company and as a board as the result of profit being taken away. It is difficult to hold Uisce Éireann accountable. As the Deputy will know, in a normal commercial company, a board-----</p>

          <p eId="para_423">That is a matter for the board of Uisce Éireann and its remuneration committee. That semi-State company has all independent members and an independent chair that are non-executive. There is also an executive. The board is there to hold the executive to account. The board reports to the Minister and was appointed by the Minister. With regard to any bonuses for executives, unlike a normal private equity company, there are no long-term incentive plans or any of that sort of stuff. It is completely different.</p>

          <p eId="para_425">May I make a brief point? In terms of how we challenge Uisce Éireann on its operational costs and how the business is managed, as part of our RC4 determination, we are proposing to impose an efficiency challenge of 10%. We reviewed Uisce Éireann's costs in detail, looking back and looking forward, and benchmarked it against UK companies. We are proposing a 10% efficiency cut. That is where we impose that type of efficiency.</p>
          <p eId="para_426"> On the issues in Ratoath, one of the other parts of our role as an economic regulator relates to customer protection. We engaged with Uisce Éireann and with many of the councillors from Ratoath at the time those issues were being experienced to ensure that customers were getting the full benefit of all the provisions we set out in our handbook for non-domestic customers and some domestic customers. We engaged on that issue and followed up to make sure there was full compliance with the handbook.</p>

We had an bord snip nua with Colm McCarthy, and I lived through that. Mr. McCarthy looked at all the regulators and how we could bring them all together. With ComReg, there was the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland at the time, and the question was asked as to why they could not work together. After a lot of reviews, and we remember that Mr. McCarthy cut the hell out of a lot of us back in the day, a lot of back-office stuff in regulators was put together, such as finance and IT functions, but they could not find synergies in the actual regulation. An bord snip nua could not put them together because it made no sense.</p>

It does not care who has the role of getting these through the planning, consent and regulation processes. It states renewable energy projects of a certain size must happen within a two-year process and projects of another particular size must happen within one year. Measures like this coming from Europe already require us to work with other regulatory authorities, such as planning authorities, MARA and others, to see how we make sure a project can come through at sufficient pace. There are areas where we absolutely interact with other regulators. We have memoranda of understanding with them to make sure our teams are in lockstep and that projects can get through the processes.</p>

There is no equivalent for gas. There is a proposal for a strategic gas reserve for emergencies, and this would be the first real gas storage that Ireland would have. It will address the levels of gas that we have in case of interruption of supply, particularly with the interconnectors and that sort of thing. In terms of electricity, the storage technologies on the system at present are batteries in the main. We have Poulaphouca reservoir, which is pumped storage, but we do not have large-scale electricity storage on the island. However, we are bringing in things on the market that will give us this storage. The key reason for this is security of supply. It is also to ensure that when the wind blows but there is not a demand there for it, that we can store it for when the wind is not blowing and for peak times.</p>

          <p eId="para_511">The wholesale market will determine this. People will generate energy and sell it into the wholesale market, and people will buy from that wholesale market. If someone across the interconnector wants to buy from Ireland because of the price it will be exported. Separately, if someone wants to charge their battery they would buy from the wholesale market and then choose when to sell it back in. It helps with the security of supply and decarbonisation, and it can also help to reduce costs by making sure we have the electrons when we need them.</p>

          <p eId="para_518">Separately, as we said at the start and we do mean it, it is very important for us that people understand the work we do. We are across water, gas, electricity and energy safety. We could sit with the committee for days on each one of these, not because there are too many processes but because the brief this so broad. In terms of follow-up with the committee, and we have been given a few pieces of homework, we are very happy to do this. We are very happy to speak on our mandate. Sometimes we see different interpretations of reports and different interpretations of what we do and do not do and what others do. It is important that people see what we do, understand it and challenge us. We are accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas and it is through these committees that we are challenged. That is also important.</p>

          <p eId="para_519">I appreciate that. I ask that any information requested today be sent to us within two weeks. However, I am conscious that the witnesses have indicated some of the information will take a little longer. I ask that this be logged with the committee in order that we have an estimate of when we will receive that information. I ask that anything that can be sent to us within a fortnight is sent within this timeframe. There being no other business, I thank everyone for their attendance.</p>

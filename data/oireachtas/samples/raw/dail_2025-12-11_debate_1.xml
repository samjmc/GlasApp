          <p eId="para_11">I welcome everyone to today's meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts. Apologies have been received from Deputy Kenny. Before we proceed, I will go through a few housekeeping matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_12"> Members are reminded of the provision within Standing Order 226 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_13"> Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> I also remind members of the constitutional requirement that, in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex. Members of the committee attending remotely must do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.</p>
          <p eId="para_15"> Today's agenda is to discuss the minutes, accounts and statements and correspondence, as well as to confirm upcoming meetings. We will then suspend the meeting and begin our engagement with officials from the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. The minutes of the meeting of 4 December 2025 were agreed by the committee and will be published on the committee's website.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> Eight sets of accounts and financial statements were laid between 1 and 5 December 2025 and are due to be considered today. We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, who is a permanent witness to the committee. I ask him to address these accounts and financial statements before I open the floor to members.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_2">
          <from> Mr. Seamus McCarthy<recordedTime time="2025-12-11T10:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_17">I will deal first with the financial statements of the Commission for Communications Regulation for the accounting period 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024. It received a clear audit opinion. I draw the committee's attention to the fact that the accounts were certified on 27 February 2025. It has been nine months since they were certified before they were presented. The committee's approach in the past has been to seek an explanation in circumstances like that.</p>
          <p eId="para_18"> No. 2 is the financial statements of the National Museum of Ireland for 2024. These received a clear audit opinion. The accounts were signed off on 26 June and they were presented after five months so, again, the committee may wish to seek an explanation for that delay.</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> No. 3 is the accounts of the Climate Action Fund for 2024, which received a clear audit opinion. No. 4 is the Irish Museum of Modern Art for 2024, which received a clear audit opinion. No. 5 is the Medical Bureau of Road Safety's financial statements for 2024, which received a clear audit opinion. No. 6 is the Medical Council's financial statements for 2024, which received a clear audit opinion but I drew attention to a material level of procurement non-compliance. In addition, the accounts were signed off on 27 June 2025, so there is a five-month delay in the presentation. Again, the committee may wish to follow up on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_20"> No. 7 is the financial statements of Pobal for 2024. It received a clear audit opinion. No. 8 is the financial statements of the National University of Ireland for 2024, which received a clear audit opinion.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnBrady" eId="spk_3">
          <from> An Cathaoirleach<recordedTime time="2025-12-11T10:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_21">I thank Mr. McCarthy. Do members wish to comment? Is it agreed that we write to those bodies that were late in presenting their accounts to seek an explanation? Agreed. Is it agreed that we note the listing of accounts and financial statements? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> I want to refer to one item of correspondence, which was received from the Peter McVerry Trust in response to additional matters raised at the meeting of 20 November. Is it agreed to note and publish this item? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> I will move on to the work programme. Next week, the committee will have its final meeting of 2025 and will engage with the Accounting Officer of the Department of Social Protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> The committee has agreed to examine the following accounts and statements in January and February, with the dates to be confirmed. We are looking at engaging with the national science centre, the Department of justice - to look at Ukrainian accommodation expenditure, St. James's Hospital, the Corporate Enforcement Authority, the National Transport Authority and the Department of agriculture. We also are looking at doing a comprehensive piece on the classification of PRSI for workers with the Department of Social Protection and Revenue. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> Are there any matters that members wish to raise under any other business?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JamesGeogheganFG" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Deputy James Geoghegan<recordedTime time="2025-12-11T10:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_26">I just want to briefly comment on the publication of an article in <i>The Currency</i> this morning that concerns Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, which was before this committee on Thursday last. What is most concerning about that article is the documents that were provided to <i>The Currency</i> under freedom of information, which were quite clearly in the possession of the IFI and known by persons who were in the room here last Thursday. It was self-evident last Thursday that we were not being given full and frank answers to some very basic questions we asked about who knew what and when in relation to a very serious allegation that a prosecutorial agency of this State knowingly provided false information to An Garda Síochána. It was very clear we were not being given full and frank answers. We looked for a series of documents at the last meeting, which are also in the possession of the IFI. I know we are going to follow up in relation to that. Those documents should be given to us immediately or as quickly as can be done. The IFI has already handed over documents to a news publication. We discussed in an earlier session that this is something the committee must inquire into again and that we must have the IFI back before the committee. I am extremely conscious that there is a live process going on in relation to the new CEO of the IFI. It is important that we put a line under issues that have been going on for more than four or five years. This is the forum in which to do so.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnBrady" eId="spk_5">
          <from> An Cathaoirleach<recordedTime time="2025-12-11T10:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_27">I thank Deputy Geoghegan for that. I agree with him. We did have a comprehensive discussion on this in our private session. Following last week's engagement with the IFI, I am on record as saying it was one of the more difficult engagements that I have had in my tenure as a member of this committee. The drip-feeding of information at that meeting last week was deeply concerning. What is even more concerning is the information that has come out in the publication, <i>The Currency</i>, this morning, in the article by Niall Sargent, which was alluded to by Deputy Geoghegan. The information contradicts a lot of the testimony that was given to us last week and calls into question timelines and who knew what when. It is deeply concerning.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">What is probably more concerning is that some of the witnesses were actively involved in the compilation of documents for the FOI request for the particular journalist. That information had only been signed off in the days in advance of our engagement with IFI last week. That information was fresh in the minds of a number of our witnesses. To my mind, there is no reason inaccurate information should have been given, or was given, to us at the public accounts committee. It is my intention, with the agreement of members, that we bring IFI back in the new year. It is critical that the information we have requested, and the documentation, correspondence and reports we have requested and will request of IFI, are made available to us as soon as possible. We are finalising a comprehensive list of documents and files that we will require and it is critical that we get this information as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> I also agree in terms of the ongoing process in the IFI to put in place a permanent chief executive. It is my intention to write to the Department and the Secretary General to outline the work we are embarked on and the concerns we have in relation to the governance within Inland Fisheries Ireland and not just over the past year. IFI has come before the Committee of Public Accounts over the past number of years and it is deeply concerning that, unfortunately, there is a continuation of serious issues that have been identified going back as far as 2020, and this is deeply concerning. I will correspond with the Department expressing our frustration and concerns and to get an update on the process. There is a role for the Minister in signing off the appointment of the incoming chief executive. We will seek an update on this. It is deeply concerning and it is an issue in which we have a keen and deep interest here in the public accounts committee.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeamusMcGrath" eId="spk_6">
          <from>Deputy Séamus McGrath<recordedTime time="2025-12-11T10:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_30">I fully agree with the Cathaoirleach and Deputy Geoghegan. It was a very difficult session last week. It was very difficult to extract information for some of the questions. It has now transpired that a lot of the information was contradictory, in terms of information that has come to light now. Absolutely we need to bring IFI back before us again. A lot of further probing is required and a lot of questions that need answers. I fully agree that we need to provide an update to the Department on the work we are doing and intend to do as the public accounts committee in relation to IFI. There is a long way to go on this yet to get to the bottom of some of the issues. I fully support the request.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulMcAuliffe" eId="spk_7">
          <from>Deputy Paul McAuliffe<recordedTime time="2025-12-11T10:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_31">It is incredibly disappointing to see documents published today that contradict evidence that was only given last week. I said at the opening this was IFI's opportunity to put a line under what had happened over the past number of years and to allow the organisation to move on with the incredibly important work it is doing. It is very important for it to know its next appearance is crucial in terms of the issues. The idea that documents could be released a week after a hearing and that there could be contradictions there is not acceptable. We have to make it aware of our disappointment in regards to this.</p>

          <p eId="para_33">We will now resume in public session. This morning we will engage with the Office of the Revenue Commissioners to examine its 2024 appropriation accounts. On behalf of the committee I welcome everyone here this morning. From the Office of the Revenue Commissioners I welcome Mr. Niall Cody, Chairman and Accounting Officer, Ms. Ruth Kennedy, director general of customs; and Ms. Leeann Kennedy, principal officer and Revenue's Oireachtas committee liaison; from the Department of Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation I welcome Mr. Dermot Nolan, principal officer, who is attending in a representative capacity; and I welcome officials from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, including Mr. Seamus McCarthy, Comptroller and Auditor General, who is a permanent witness to the committee; and Ms. Niamh Kilkenny, audit manager. They are all very welcome here this morning.</p>
          <p eId="para_34"> Before we begin I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence. The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege. This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting. However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege, and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure this privilege is not abused. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, witnesses will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_35"> Witnesses are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_36"> I now call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.</p>
        </speech>

          <from> Mr. Seamus McCarthy<recordedTime time="2025-12-11T10:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_37">The account of the receipt of revenue of the State collected by the Revenue Commissioners is the primary report on the sources of the State's income, including tax payable directly into the Exchequer, and other forms of income such as social insurance contributions, health insurance levy receipts and local property tax receipts.</p>
          <p eId="para_38">The 2024 account of the receipt of revenue of the State records net receipts of taxes and duties amounting to €107.1 billion, an increase of €19.9 billion, or 23%, when compared to 2023. Corporation tax receipts comprised the largest receipts stream in 2024, boosted by the receipt of €10.9 billion as part of the winding down of the Apple escrow account following the judgment by the Court of Justice of the European Union that Ireland had in the past granted the Apple Group unlawful state aid in how its tax affairs were dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_39"> In addition to tax receipts paid to the Exchequer, net receipts collected by Revenue on behalf of other agencies and funds increased from €26.2 billion to €30.7 billion, an increase of 17%. Pay-related social insurance contributions and VAT one-stop-shop scheme receipts together account for the majority of non-Exchequer receipts. I issued a clear audit opinion in relation to the Revenue account.</p>
          <p eId="para_40"> All the expenses incurred by Revenue in the exercise of its functions are charged to Vote 9. Certain receipts in relation to Revenue’s operations, including fee income for agency services it provides, are also accounted for in the appropriation account.</p>
          <p eId="para_41"> Revenue’s total gross expenditure in 2024 was €581 million, with salary costs of €394 million accounting for almost 68% of the expenditure. Taking account of appropriations-in-aid of €64.7 million, net expenditure amounted to €516 million. At the end of 2024, there was a surplus of €15.8 million for surrender to the Exchequer.</p>
          <p eId="para_42"> I issued a clear audit opinion in relation to the appropriation account. However, I drew attention to non-compliance with procurement rules and to a payment redirection fraud that occurred in 2024, disclosed by the Accounting Officer in the statement on internal financial control. The payment of €343,000 made by Revenue was recovered in full, and steps have been taken to tighten payment controls.</p>
          <p eId="para_43"> In addition to auditing the Revenue account and Vote 9, I have a specific remit to examine and report on whether the systems and controls in place are adequate to secure an effective check on the assessment, collection and proper allocation of the revenues of the State, and to ascertain whether the way they are employed and deployed is adequate. Chapter 18 examines Revenue’s approach to the assessment and collection of carbon taxes and assesses more broadly whether the increases in carbon tax receipts since 2020 have been allocated and spent on the targeted schemes and programmes. The stated aim was that the increased receipts would be used to fund expenditure including that related to just transition schemes, retrofitting and sustainable farming. We found that between 2020 and 2023, €1.36 billion in increased carbon tax revenue was allocated by the Department of Public Expenditure to specified expenditure programmes across five departmental Votes. However, because the expenditure was less than the amounts provided and had to be surrendered, or because funding was mixed in with other core funding, only 61% of the sum allocated could be verified as having been spent on additional carbon tax measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_44"> Chapter 19 examines Revenue’s systems and procedures for assessing and collecting the sugar tax introduced in 2018, along with its approach to identifying and tackling possible non-compliance. Net receipts totalled €172 million between 2018 and 2023, with annual net receipts decreasing from €33 million in 2019 to €29 million in 2023. The extent to which the decline in receipts was due to either product reformulation by manufacturers or changes in consumption patterns is difficult to determine. Between 2018 and 2023, Revenue carried out 126 compliance interventions for the sugar tax, yielding a total of €426,000. The report made two recommendations around the approval process for sugar tax repayment claims, and both were accepted by Revenue.</p>
          <p eId="para_45"> Chapter 20 reviews Revenue’s approach to monitoring and managing taxpayer compliance, focusing on the measures Revenue has in place to assess, detect and deter non-compliance. Unlike in some other jurisdictions, there is no official estimate of the level of tax evasion in Ireland. We noted that the numbers of risk-based audits, investigations and non-audit interventions carried out annually by Revenue have been steadily declining since 2016. However, the additional tax yield from that activity has remained relatively stable year on year, indicating that detection work is generally well targeted.</p>
          <p eId="para_46"> Chapter 21 reviews the circumstances around the settlement reached with a retailer that was considerably less than the original assessed liability in respect of the plastic bag levy. In 2009, following an audit of a retailer, Revenue issued notices of assessment for an aggregate outstanding amount of €36.6 million in respect of plastic bag levies due for the period 1 July 2004 to 30 June 2008. The retailer appealed Revenue’s assessment of liability and commenced legal proceedings, which extended over many years. In preparation for the appeal hearing in 2021, Revenue reviewed the calculations supporting its November 2009 notices of assessment and identified a number of issues. On the basis of that review, Revenue reduced the estimated liability to €8.5 million, which was less than one quarter of the original demand. This assessment was confirmed by the Tax Appeals Commission in September 2023. Having consulted the Department of Climate, Energy and the Environment, Revenue subsequently accepted a settlement offer of €5 million from the retailer, which was 59% of the assessed liability. </p>
          <p eId="para_47"> Chapter 22 reviews the key trends in taxable rental income over a six-year period, from 2017 to 2022, and considers the systems and procedures Revenue has in place to facilitate the assessment and timely collection of tax on rental income. In 2022, gross domestic rental income declared was around €8 billion, comprising €4.8 billion declared by individuals and €3.2 billion declared by companies. Most rental income declared by companies relates to commercial properties, while individuals primarily declared rental income from residential properties. Companies appear to be able to use deductible expenses, capital allowances and losses to reduce their overall taxable rental income more effectively than individual owners of rental property.</p>
          <p eId="para_48"> Revenue’s primary focus is on taxpayers and their compliance with applicable tax law rather than on the impact of taxation on economic sectors, and this is reflected in the way it gathers information from taxpayers. Because the property rental market is such a critical issue in current public discourse, I see considerable potential merit in better understanding its structures and operations. The report recommended that Revenue should consider publishing rental income statistics for companies, and this has been accepted by Revenue. The report also recommended that Revenue consider amending its taxpayer returns to include details of individual rental properties, including, for example, a unique property identifier such as the eircode. The final recommendation proposed that Revenue should also consider requiring caseworkers to record the yield from compliance activity by source – for example, rental income – and to collate this data. These two recommendations have not been accepted by Revenue for reasons set out in the report. </p>

          <p eId="para_49">I now invite Mr. Niall Cody to make his opening statement on behalf of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. As set out in the letter of invitation, Mr. Cody has five minutes in which to do so.</p>

          <from> Mr. Niall Cody<recordedTime time="2025-12-11T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_50">I thank the Cathaoirleach for the opportunity to make my opening statement. I understand that today’s meeting is focused on the 2024 account on the receipt of revenue of the State, the 2024 appropriation account, and chapters in the Comptroller and Auditor General’s 2023 and 2024 reports on the accounts of the public service, as well as matters relating to the <i>MV Matthew</i>.</p>
          <p eId="para_51"> In 2024, Revenue collected total gross receipts of €153 billion, including €31 billion in non-Exchequer receipts collected on behalf of other Government Departments and agencies. The net Exchequer receipts, of €107 billion, were up by almost €20 billion on 2023.</p>
          <p eId="para_52">Up to the end of November this year, Exchequer receipts collected by Revenue were €97 billion which, when you exclude the state aid receipts, is up over 8% from the same point last year. Revenue's gross expenditure in 2024 was €581 million. Revenue had 6,805 staff serving at the end of 2024, with €394 million, or 68% of Revenue's gross expenditure in 2024, related to pay. The other main item of expenditure was on information and communications technology, ICT, which accounted for some €88 million in 2024.</p>
          <p eId="para_53"> Chapter 18 of the 2023 report examined the systems and procedures Revenue has in place to facilitate the assessment and timely collection of carbon taxes. The examination team made no findings. In 2023, the year to which the chapter relates, Revenue collected almost €935 million in carbon tax receipts. In 2024, it was €1.07 billion, and to the end of October 2025, €961 million. Most carbon tax receipts come from the carbon component of the mineral oil tax which, over the past three years, has accounted for approximately 86% of all carbon tax receipts.</p>
          <p eId="para_54"> Chapter 19 of the 2023 report focused on the systems and procedures Revenue has in place for the collection of the sugar-sweetened drinks tax. The tax operates as an excise duty and is administered on a self-assessment basis. In 2024, Revenue collected €30.5 million from the sugar-sweetened drinks tax, with €25.4 million collected in 2025 to date. The chapter made two recommendations, both of which were agreed, with remedial actions arising implemented in full.</p>
          <p eId="para_55"> Chapter 20 of the 2023 report reviewed Revenue's approach to monitoring and managing taxpayer compliance and focuses on the measures Revenue has in place to assess, detect and deter non-compliance. Since 2018, Revenue's structure is one of a segmented case base that seeks to align resource allocation to risk. Where tax risks are identified, Revenue's compliance intervention framework provides a consistent and graduated response to taxpayer behaviour, ranging from extensive opportunities to voluntarily correct mistakes up to the pursuit of criminal sanctions for cases of serious tax and duty evasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_56"> In 2024, Revenue completed over 272,600 audit and compliance interventions, which yielded €591 million. Revenue secured 148 summary convictions, as well as 20 criminal convictions for serious tax evasion and published 74 settlements in the list of tax defaulters. In 2025, to date, Revenue has completed almost €197,000 audit and compliance interventions, which yielded €476.7 million. The chapter makes two recommendations, both of which were agreed, with remedial actions significantly advanced and very much part of Revenue's ongoing programme of systems development.</p>
          <p eId="para_57"> The plastic bag levy was introduced in 2001 with the main purpose of reducing the consumption of single-use plastic bags by influencing consumer behaviour. The progressive reduction in the use of the levy on plastic bags is reflected in the trend of annual levy receipts, which peaked at €27 million in 2008 and had fallen to €1.4 million by 2023. Chapter 21 of the 2023 report reviewed the assessment and collection of the plastic bag levy in respect of a specific taxpayer. I trust the committee will understand that due to my legal obligation under section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, which is to uphold taxpayer confidentiality, it is not possible for me to discuss matters pertaining to a specific taxpayer.</p>
          <p eId="para_58"> Chapter 22 of the 2024 report focused on the taxation of income derived by specific cohorts of taxpayers operating in the rental sector. It is the responsibility of those in receipt of rental income, in line with the principles of self-assessment, to ensure that the rental income is reported to Revenue in their annual tax return. As outlined in the chapter, across the years 2017 to 2023, Revenue carried out just over 21,000 compliance interventions on taxpayers who operated in the rental sector. The total yield from these interventions was just over €230 million. In 2024 and the year 2025 to date, Revenue carried out a further 2,500 compliance interventions with an associated yield of €43.1 million. The chapter makes three recommendations, one of which was agreed. Of the recommendations not agreed, the first relates to broader policy matters that fall outside Revenue's remit, while the second relates to the recording of yield from compliance activity under the specific income stream giving rise to the yield. I am satisfied that the current approach to recording compliance intervention outcomes adequately supports effective reporting of the compliance activities and aligns with the basis on which tax liabilities are calculated.</p>
          <p eId="para_59"> The committee has also expressed an interest in matters relating to the <i>MV Matthew</i>. Following on from my correspondence with the committee on this matter in September 2025, the advance briefing provided for today's meeting includes up-to-date information and cost figures reflecting the current position in relation to the <i>MV Matthew</i>. I assure the committee that the disposal of this vessel is a key priority for Revenue and I am happy to discuss this matter further at today's meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_60"> To conclude, I wish to take this opportunity to thank all Revenue staff for their professionalism, dedication and commitment. I again draw the committee's attention to section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and my obligation to uphold taxpayers' confidentiality. Subject to this constraint, I am happy to answer the committee's questions.</p>

          <p eId="para_61">I thank Mr. Cody. I note that we will suspend the meeting for about ten or 15 minutes at 12 noon and resume shortly afterwards.

          <p eId="para_62">I thank the Cathaoirleach. To start, I understand that Revenue operates on the basis of different divisions. There are five national operational divisions, which are effectively the ones pursuing tax compliance with different types of individual and companies. There are large corporates, high wealth and financial services, medium enterprise, business and personal divisions. Could Mr. Cody give me a rough estimate of how many staff are working in each of those divisions?</p>

          <from> Mr. Niall Cody<recordedTime time="2025-12-11T10:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_63">The personal and business divisions both have around 1,000 staff. The large corporates division is probably something around 300. The high wealth and financial services, HWFS, division has slightly less than the large corporates division, LCD, and the medium enterprise division probably has around 550.</p>

          <p eId="para_66">That is useful. That gets to what I am interested in there, which is the large corporates division. Large corporates make up heading towards 20% of our total tax revenue, I think, but they only make up 10% of the staff. Could Revenue do with more there?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_19">
          <from> Mr. Niall Cody<recordedTime time="2025-12-11T10:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_67">When we restructured, we realigned our structure from four geographic regions in 2018. We always had a large corporates division but we felt at that time that the scale of the large corporate sector and the complexity had grown so much that the geographical regional system was no longer appropriate. At that stage, the large cases division looked after large corporates plus high-wealth individuals. We divided those two but we have increased the resources for large corporates and high wealth by, I would say, 60% to 70% in that period. That was purposeful. In the large corporates and high-wealth individuals divisions there is a high level of principal officer and assistant principal officer grade. The personal division has a significant number of clerical officers and executive officers. What we are trying to do is make sure we are adequately resourced to address those issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_68"> If you take large corporates, it is organised on a sectoral basis. We would have a fairly constant review of the large corporate sector by dedicated resources to give that overview of what is happening. There are areas in the financial services sector that are structured in such a way legally that there is very little tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_69">Certainly, to this committee, and, to be fair, to the Comptroller and Auditor General over the years, we would have indicated that we had a concern that we just did not understand enough-----</p>

          <p eId="para_73">I remember dealing with parliamentary questions about how many audits we did on section 110 companies. The figures looked really small as a result of the fact that an audit is not the appropriate intervention because those companies are structured in such a way as to not have a tax liability. In 2015, we published our first detailed analysis of corporation tax and every year since, we have published detailed analyses of corporation tax. The Deputy can see-----</p>

          <p eId="para_74">A related question is that, obviously, advance tax decisions were something the public became aware of because we had the Apple case. The essence of that case was two advanced tax decisions from Revenue saying to Apple that these companies will be treated in a certain way. That, ultimately, was found to constitute substantial state aid. Are there advance tax decisions with other multinationals? I am obviously not asking Mr. Cody to name them, but how many of these advance tax decisions are there?</p>

At the time of the Commission opinion, one of the things we agreed to do was publish the number of opinions. In our annual report, the publish details of the number of opinions. In the most recent annual report, 80 opinions were listed. We publish that information every year - I think we are doing so this week - and we issue a tax and duty manual to practitioners. One of the other agreements is that each ruling is timebound up to a maximum of five years-----</p>

          <p eId="para_78">I will move on. One of the striking things is that the number of audits and investigations has been coming down significantly. In the years immediately after 2016, there were over 6,000. By 2021, the figure had dropped to just over 1,000. In 2023, it was under 1,000. The yield has not come down to the same extent it came down initially, and then it comes back up. What explains that significant reduction?</p>

          <from> Mr. Niall Cody<recordedTime time="2025-12-11T11:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_79">It goes back to our realignment of our structures. One of the particular concerns I have with the geographic regional system is that if we count the number of audits, we can do ten audits of a small business, which would take time. We probably would not do one of a large corporate in the same period. Therefore, what we did was structure our resources to deal with the risk.</p>

          <p eId="para_81">It is more focused on both identifying risk, which applies across the case base, but also complexity. If there is an IT systems mistake in a large entity in relation to VAT, that can lead to a significant liability. Such a mistake would not indicate any attempt at evasion. It is down to the structure and the resources. We have been the subject of various reports by the staff of the Comptroller and Auditor General would look at the 20 biggest audits in a year. That is always a really interesting chapter for everybody.</p>

          <p eId="para_82">I will move on. In relation to the chapter on rental taxation, there was what seems to have been a very effective project focusing on landlords with three or more properties. Between 2024 and 2024, the division carried 884 interventions in total. Around 46% of the cases - almost half - yielded more than €7 million in tax interests and penalties. On average, each one was about €18,000. First, were those randomly chosen or where they picked because there were some red flags that suggested they might, effectively, have been overestimating their expenses?</p>

          <p eId="para_124">The witnesses are all very welcome. I start with nitrous oxide. Revenue and Customs officials have said on "Prime Time" that this is being brought into Ireland at scale by organised crime gangs and that it is being used nationwide. While the smaller cartridges do, ostensibly, have a use in catering, Mr. Thomas Talbot from the Revenue's criminal investigation team has said there is no legitimate use for the larger canisters. Organised crime is making money on the back of society. I have been highlighting this issue for years. There is growing evidence of the use of nitrous oxide in communities, and the number of instances of harm caused by the misuse of nitrous oxide are becoming increasingly apparent. I do not think the Government is taking this as seriously as it should.</p>
          <p eId="para_125"> We have a Bill before the House to provide for the regulation of the sale of nitrous oxide. Basically, it would ensure that nitrous oxide would be regulated for commercial use only. It is similar to legislation in the Netherlands. The Bill would give the Garda powers to seize canisters from those lacking the appropriate licences. Is this something the Revenue would support?</p>

It needs to be disposed of safely, and this is a real problem. Ms Kennedy has been talking to her French colleagues. They have the same problem. There is a legitimate use for this product, but it is a fairly limited, curtailed one. Anyone who walks around the city will see the discarded canisters.

Between 2020 and 2023, more than €1.3 billion in funding increases from carbon tax rates was allocated by the Department of public expenditure to specific programmes across five other Departments. The report states that only 61% of that sum could be verified as having been spent on targeted schemes and programmes. Of the €28 million in carbon tax funding, €13 million was deferred between 2020 and 2023. It was subsequently used on programmes that were not targeted for funding from the increases relating to carbon tax. What measures have been taken to ensure that the funding from carbon tax increases is spent only on the targeted schemes and programmes it is supposed to be spent on?</p>

          <p eId="para_140">We have no role in this regard. Our job is to collect the money involved. We then pass it to the Exchequer and the Government. The chapter sets out very well the position in relation to it. We have no role in relation to it, however. As with any other tax receipts we get, it is passed on to the Exchequer. Our role stops there.</p>

          <p eId="para_145">Fair enough. I am sure this matter will be picked up by my colleagues later.</p>
          <p eId="para_146"> The upkeep of the <i>MV Matthew</i> is costing a fortune. The amount of money involved is exorbitant. Nearly €10 million has been spent in less than two years. In other words, a startling amount of more than €100,000 a week. Mr. Cody is on record as saying the disposal of the vessel is a priority for Revenue, but that seems to be proving problematic. Has Revenue considered scuttling the vessel? There is precedent in that regard with the <i>MV Shingle. </i>The latter was moored in the port of Drogheda, my hometown, at certain times from 2014 until it was eventually sunk off the coast of County Mayo in 2024. If consideration has not been given to scuttling the <i>MV Matthew</i>, have we had a look at what price it will fetch in a sale or whether there would be a net profit or loss for the taxpayer?</p>

          <p eId="para_147">We have provided up-to-date information to the committee in relation to the <i>MV Matthew</i>. It is worthwhile to go over how the ship ended up in our control. The <i>MV Matthew</i> is a very large ship that was used for the smuggling of 2,250 kg of cocaine into the State. It was taken out by Revenue, the Army Rangers, the Navy and the Garda. This was the largest seizure of cocaine ever in the country and one of the largest ever in Europe. The seizure of the vessel was unprecedented. This vessel was bought by an international crime gang to import a consignment of drugs, and 2,500 kg is a lot of cocaine. In the context of the size of the ship, the consignment took up a very small portion of it. This happened in September 2023.</p>

          <p eId="para_149">This is really important because there is a concern, and it has been expressed to us, regarding the ship being expensive to keep and there being regulatory requirements we have to meet. There is a concern that if this happens again, we will be deterred from seizing vessels because of the scrutiny involved and on foot of people's concerns. I just want to put on record that if something similar happens, we will do exactly the same thing.</p>
          <p eId="para_150"> In relation to the context, Deputy McGrath knows very well the size of the ship and the safekeeping of it. To ensure safety - environmental and ecological - and due to the impact on Cork Port, we have had to crew the vessel. There is a crew of 13 permanently on this vessel. The vessel has to be kept operating. Until December 2024, it was part of evidence for the court proceedings and then the Special Criminal Court gave us approval to put it up for sale. Before we could sell it, we had to have it properly registered. The engagement with the Panama flag authorities was protracted, partly because the owners of the vessel had not carried all the regulatory requirements.</p>

We told them that it absolutely would not deter us. We have never had to dispose of anything like this before. There are things we would do a little differently. We are reviewing what we are doing. I hope we will manage to dispose of the vessel in the first half of next year and at that stage we will carry out a detailed review of every aspect to see what we could do better and could not do better.

          <p eId="para_257">That is absolutely the case. There are a number of reasons vessels would be seized. The numerous sanctions imposed by the EU on Russia is one of the reasons. My German colleagues seized <i>MV Eventin</i>, an oil tanker that was a part of the Russian shadow fleet which came into German waters. Since March 2025, Germany has had to maintain that vessel. Not only does it have to crew and berth it, and pay for its running, it is also full of oil so, from an environmental and hazardous perspective, the Germans are trying to determine how to take the oil off that ship.</p>
          <p eId="para_258"> The Italians have seized a number of super yachts from Russian oligarchs under the sanctions. One of those is costing €30,000 a day to maintain. In the US, some of the yachts seized under the sanctions packaged are costing over €7 million per year at the moment. There are significant seizure expenses. We have seen the success of the Criminal Assets Bureau. It is important that we take out the product and the societal impact of the product on the country and the expenses of the country. An academic research paper from 2000 stated that in one year, class A drugs in the UK, including Wales, had a societal cost of €13 billion. Cocaine to a value of €157 million, had it come onto the market in Ireland, would have had an impact on justice, criminality, education, absenteeism and child protection. There is a huge societal cost so it is important that we attack those who bring it in where it hurts most, which is in their pockets.</p>

          <p eId="para_259">I do not mean the following in a trivial way, but Mr. Cody almost smiles when he thinks back to the seizure of this vessel. It was a record-breaking seizure for the State. From Revenue's intelligence, how often does it feel that vessels of this size are entering Irish water space and carrying such large drug loads? Notwithstanding the success in respect of the seizure in question, we have not seen seizures of vessels of that nature since. Is that correct?</p>

          <p eId="para_260">The sense in European law enforcement is that having a ship devoted solely to drug smuggling is a new <i>modus operandi</i>.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">Normally, there is a container ship in which drugs are placed, either through collusion with crew members or with the shipping company, but there is a cover load. The drugs are dumped at sea by the mother ship and picked up by a daughter boat. The last big criminal prosecution involved a rigid inflatable boat, RIB. The current MO tends to be fast, high-powered RIBs picking up. It is not clear that all the drugs that come into the State are destined for the Irish market alone.</p>

The reality is that their accounts always report on it. We would have regular interaction with Government bodies and semi-State bodies in relation to tax compliance.

          <p eId="para_270">I thank Mr. Cody and his colleagues for being here. I want to begin with the area of social media influencers. There was a report this year in the media of a settlement of a combined €3.3 million following an investigation between 2020 and 2025. To clarify, have the taxes been fully recouped by Revenue at this point from any parties involved in that investigation?</p>

          <p eId="para_271">The work is ongoing. In that period of time, we would have written what we call a level 1 letter, which is essentially advising them of their requirement. It has been a really interesting project. Obviously, it involved a lot of people who were not hugely familiar with tax obligations, some of them with really significant levels of income and turnover. Our main interest is making sure that people voluntarily comply. That is what drives our activity. If they do not, it leads to an escalation of the intervention. Some of the interventions have led to audits and settlements of fairly significant liabilities. It then becomes an ongoing part of compliance. We have recovered significant amounts in relation to social media influencers.</p>
          <p eId="para_272"> Due to the legislation in relation to platform providers, we also have to report the payments made. If you are doing it, we will know about it. That is why we encourage people to comply. Interestingly, right now, there is a public consultation by the Department of Finance and ourselves on how to tax platform providers in relation to money that flows through them. It focuses on withholding taxes and trying to modernise the reporting system to ensure that people are paying the right amount at the right time so they do not end up with significant liabilities. We know of social media influencers - very young people - with significant six-figure sums earned over a short number of years.</p>

          <p eId="para_274">No. Generally, they are being paid, but we would prefer if they were paid on time. To go back to Deputy Geoghegan's question, sometimes the interest bill is far more excessive than any penalties. It is really in people's interest to pay tax when it falls due.</p>

          <p eId="para_276">We have published comprehensive guidelines on the tax treatment for income tax, capital acquisitions-gift tax and value-added tax in relation to the different issues. I have read some commentary that the actual model is not up-to-date enough, but we have to operate within the legislative framework. I was reading recently about complaints that OnlyFans people were not able to claim expenses for items of clothing, for example. It is a very different model, in that it is all done through social media. We operate under rules around expenses that are wholly and exclusively incurred for the purpose of the trade. There is a lot of case law interpreting that. It goes back through both the UK and Ireland in relation to suits, barristers and wigs. There is a whole range of case law, and there will be more case law. People are entitled to appeal. The Tax Appeals Commission is a legal, semi-judicial forum, independent from us, that deals with technical interpretation. That is always evolving as business models evolve.</p>

It was interesting to read that almost 60,000 referrals made to Revenue in the year were considered, resulting in the collection of over €250 million.

          <p eId="para_281">I really have to go back to 2019, when we rolled out our new debt management system. About November 2019, we were piloting our new debt management system, which was due to significantly speed up our enforcement operation. When Covid happened in March 2020, we suspended all enforcement action. The debt warehouse came in legally in July 2020 and that ran until May 2022. Essentially, normal debt management and enforcement stopped for that entire period. Obviously, as we came out of public health restrictions, May 2022 to probably 2023 was focused on the unwinding of the debt warehousing system. In 2024, we started to reboot the debt management system and that is fully operational now. What happened over 2023, 2024 and into 2025 was a slippage in timely compliance. That was the overhang of the restrictions. Our aim now is to get back to where we would like to be, where people pay tax as it falls due. There is a significant impact. I was reading last week a report on our activity this year through the debt management system and the expectation is that it has led to an additional €109 billion to date this year in recovering debt that was late and not paid. That will continue.</p>

The majority of this was assigned to something called professional services withholding tax rules. In a similar response by CIÉ, it said it had made similar settlements but spoke about IT assets under CIÉ Tours USA. What strikes me as interesting is that CIÉ is involved in the co-operative compliance framework, CCF. Who is party to that? Are semi-States and commercial bodies party to that framework? Is Dublin Airport Authority party to that? Who opts in and out of that framework?</p>

Where I am coming from is just about how the process has been handled, the disposal of the vessel and so on. Of course we need to do this again. It was €158 million worth of drugs seized and eight people sentenced. This was absolutely critical for our security forces. I hope Mr. Cody understands where we are coming from.</p>

This is raising a lot of concern with regard to the duration this ship has been maintained and the cost involved in it.

          <p eId="para_346">I thank the witnesses for coming in.</p>
          <p eId="para_347"> I would like to discuss all things related to eProbate and estate clearance. My first question is going to be in relation to estate clearance. A new system was introduced in 2020. I am wondering what its rationale was and how it differs from the previous letter-of-no-audit system. People listening to these proceedings should note that when you die, there is an audit pretty much on your life. It would have been done previously, especially when it came to overseas beneficiaries, but we are seeing a lot more focus on it now by Revenue. I wonder why, even though Revenue was always entitled to do it. For executors administering loved one’s estates, maybe themselves or through accountants or solicitors, it is causing some angst. The system is quite onerous and it seems it could be simpler. So much of what is done in Revenue is so simple, straightforward and really clear. It is ahead of many other organisations when it comes to IT. I am just wondering, with regard to what is like the last piece in the probate picture, whether something could be done to simplify things for the public.</p>

          <p eId="para_348">I thank the Deputy. I had not anticipated that I would be talking about this today. I will certainly provide a detailed note to the committee on the issue. To go back a bit, a number of years ago we moved the system for returning an IR38 form online. I am referring to an online statement of affairs. This reflects how complicated the estate is. A simple estate has very little detail. With regard to more complex estates, there will be a lot more people with expensive properties, bank accounts and all the rest. The online system is to facilitate and support people at the difficult time involved. We are also engaged with the Courts Service. We hope to have a single reporting arrangement that would cover our requirements and those of the Courts Service. I remember meeting the head of the Courts Service around our plans, and the service was not then ready to move to a full e-probate system. We said we would go ahead with the online statement of affairs, which would facilitate the Courts Service building on it. I know that the Courts Service has announced its plans for eProbate.</p>
          <p eId="para_349"> As regards finalisation, because we operate a self-assessment system for all taxes, we have moved away from clearance systems as a matter of course. This has been the subject of some concern among solicitors in relation to the local property tax, the residential zoned land tax and various other property-related taxes. It comes back to how the legislation is framed. It will probably depend on the Courts Service completing its work so that we can have an integrated process. If there is work required, we commit to studying it. We will get back to the committee on it.</p>

          <p eId="para_350">It seems that Revenue is now asking a lot more questions. It is obviously entitled to do so, but there does not seem to be a streamlined way for people to figure out what they have to do. What happens is that a person has to wait until they receive their grant of probate. They then apply for estate clearance. If Revenue asks no questions within 35 days, the person can proceed to administer the estate. Revenue does come back with questions. It seems a little haphazard considering that the rest of the system, such as that for the capital acquisitions tax return form, the SA.2, is really clear about what is required of people. People cannot really understand the third part and are trying to figure it out. A lot more clarity is needed. It might be something on which Mr. Cody can come back to me.</p>

The tax administration liaison committee, TALC, is a standing committee comprising representatives from Chartered Accountants Ireland, the Irish Tax Institute, the Law Society of Ireland and us, and it looks at administrative issues.

          <p eId="para_357">It is a multi-tax audit that is done on an individual. The local property tax is a huge part of it. Clearance letters are not issued for people who have not paid local property tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_358"> We deal with a lot of people. This might be a policy issue, but it also comes under the tax regime. A lot of single people who do not have children feel aggrieved that their nieces and nephews are categorised as class C beneficiaries. There is a vocal advocacy group. A huge proportion of people now do not have children, but feel their nieces and nephews are as close to them. For the farming community, there is a favourite nephew or niece exemption for farms, but there is nothing for people who have just worked their whole lives and paid income tax and every other tax they had to pay as it fell due. It might be an issue for the Minister for Finance at budget time, but I wonder whether the Revenue Commissioners have a take on an enhanced threshold for disponers who do not have any children.</p>

The regulatory hoops we had to go through to get it to a stage where it could be towed to Killala Bay involved MSO surveys.

Revenue calculated that a retailer owed €36.5 million, and ultimately it settled for €5 million. Once again it is that tax gap. This brings me full circle in my questions. Why did we think it was €36.5 million and why did they think it was €8.5 million? Why was it ultimately settled for €5 million?</p>

          <p eId="para_415">As I said in my opening remarks, I am precluded under law from talking about an individual taxpayer's affairs. In general terms, what would have happened was an original assessment based on really incomplete information. Then the issue was subject to judicial review and, ultimately, appeals to the higher courts, not with us but in relation to the legislation. There was a lot of complexity about that case. As the Deputy may know from his own business, sometimes in the absence of complete information assessments will be made to the best ability of the officer concerned. There are a lot of legal challenges and a lot of legal difficulties around the definitions. If members read the judgment in the case, the legislation on which it was originally based was not as clear as it should be.</p>

          <p eId="para_417">I thank our witnesses for being here today. The benefit of speaking later in the order is that I get ideas from everybody else who has raised them. I want to echo the points made by Deputy Ardagh on probate. A significant number of people have come to me to say they have processed probate in the past for older relatives and they are finding it far more difficult now than it was previously. Some of that was down to the really great staff in the public probate office. I know there has been some change since Covid and so on but when Mr. Cody is coming back to us on the numbers for Deputy Ardagh, will he also include those cases that are processed by individuals rather than by solicitors, if Revenue has those figures? Has that number declined? If it has, I suppose it would match the anecdotal evidence I have been given.</p>
          <p eId="para_418"> Mr. Cody is right when he says that tax warehousing has been very successful. It gave people who were creating and maintaining employment a breathing space. Mr. Cody said something very interesting in that he hopes it will never happen again. A similar application might arise in the case of a significant financial downturn. Has Revenue done any analysis about whether a similar policy measure at such a time could maintain jobs in the same way?</p>

The reality of what happened in the economic crash was that tax liabilities went through the floor. I was looking at figures last week. I was going to a branch conference and I was looking at corporation tax. Corporation tax in 2012 was €4.2 billion. Total tax receipts were some €36 billion.

It came back and said, "We do not give advice on illegal activity." I was reassured by that but I am sure there is a darknet that says, "We do not give advice on legal activity."</p>

          <p eId="para_472">I thank the witnesses for being here today and engaging with us on our questions. During his time in the finance brief, I wrote to the then Minister, Michael McGrath, about the potential for improving how the help to buy scheme works and how it is rolled out. When someone is earning a wage and paying income tax, the help to buy scheme only updates on the online system after January once a person's total income for that year has been dealt with. There is no rolling calculation of someone's eligibility for the help to buy scheme. If someone is working they pay income tax and that is added to their total available moneys every month. This is essentially a person's savings account with Revenue, should they decide to be a first-time buyer of a new home. The problem is that if that person goes sale agreed on a home in the middle of the year and has not reached the total €30,000, they will have potentially paid income tax for six months and will not be entitled to claim it back. We know Revenue payroll notifications, RPNs, are done and companies put in information. I understand the concern that somebody who stops working will not pay enough income tax to the end the year. In general, however, somebody who takes on a mortgage to buy a home will more than likely endeavour to stay in employment. Has any consideration ever been given to a rolling calculation of help to buy eligibility?</p>

          <p eId="para_473">The help to buy rules provide that tax paid for the four years, up to €30,000, is allowable if you qualify. What you would have access to under the PAYE system is that you can look up your payroll up to today, which would show the tax paid. If, say, it is the tax paid to 31 July and you were looking at that in August, you would be able to see the tax paid on the PAYE system.</p>

          <p eId="para_478">That is fair enough; I understand. It should be considered, however, because, for example, when students come out of college and start earning, they may not have four years of income tax history and may not have paid €30,000, but they could then rack it up fairly quickly. There is a six- to 12-month period where they could pay a lot of income tax, and that does not give them the leg up to go and buy a house.</p>

          <p eId="para_480">On another issue with the help to buy scheme, I have written to the Revenue Commissioners about it and I really appreciate its engagement on it. This is about the data that is available on who is accessing the help to buy scheme. Is it young people, older people, single people, couples or families? What nationality are they? Who is really good at availing of the help to buy scheme? This data would be very valuable for us as policymakers. I invite Revenue to consider publishing a report on who has availed of the help to buy scheme, who it is benefiting most and who is purchasing properties as a result of the scheme. I know the scheme has been a huge success. I hear it anecdotally from friends who have bought their first home using the scheme. It is an incredible scheme to help people who are paying high rents but still have to find a way to save a deposit. This is a way to do that. What data does Revenue collect on the help to buy scheme? Does it plan to publish an independent report on how the scheme has functioned and where the gaps are? One issue I find is that people tell me the €500,000 price ceiling is an issue. Obviously, that is a policy decision but I would love to know what the data is saying.</p>

          <p eId="para_481">We publish the data that we have as a result of the help to buy scheme. We publish the number of claimants and the number that proceed to buy. There are two phases. People apply first and then have to find the house they want to buy. We regularly publish our statistics on the amounts, the people who claim and the number of people per claim. Sometimes it is an individual, but mostly it is probably two people. There are, however, a number of cases where there are three or four people involved in the purchase, and so we publish those statistics.</p>
          <p eId="para_482"> I have seen the questions the Deputy has asked and they are very interesting. We publish the information we have. Regarding one of the Deputy's questions, we highlighted the role of the Central Statistics Office. Our PAYE data is the lifeblood for the CSO to publish all our labour statistics. I was talking to the director general of the CSO last week about the Deputy's parliamentary question. The CSO publishes really interesting data, which brings in nationality and educational attainment and links this data in to social welfare. We are very proud of the publications of the statistics that we do but I am also conscious that the statistics we collate are to help the tax administration process.</p>

          <p eId="para_485">I just think there is an opportunity for help to buy data to better inform policymakers around how the scheme is functioning. I think it is a fantastic scheme. People get back what they put in and it works. It helps people who are struggling to save a deposit.</p>
          <p eId="para_486"> Over the past few months, I have been focusing on data quality, collation of information and trying to provide greater transparency around public procurement. Revenue has a really strong set of capabilities in-house and it is still really good at leveraging the private market to bring in expertise that Revenue may not have, be it IT or data analytics. From speaking to the Secretaries General of various Departments, I find they are always very impressed with how well Revenue does that. That is a compliment and a credit to the witnesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_487"> There is still a transparency gap around something going out for procurement. A contract goes to tender and is awarded, then we have a purchase order and then, ultimately, we have a payment. Does Revenue link that from end to end in its data or internally? I know it does not publish that information. It publishes its purchase orders, as required under the publication scheme. How does Revenue contract manage internally?</p>

          <p eId="para_488">We have a central team in our ICT and logistics division which oversees procurement for Revenue. It links in with the Office of Government Procurement to use its frameworks, where appropriate. Our big tendering process tends to be on ICT and our division has expertise in that area. There are a number of areas that are outside the central process, mostly to do with education and training and some services on the legal side, and they are managed in their division.</p>
          <p eId="para_489"> We take a very serious approach to procurement and tendering. There are developments coming down the track, which I think are really important in relation to some of the issues the Deputy is interested in. These include the modernisation of the VAT system and VAT in the digital age, which is built on mandatory electronic invoicing. That will be revolutionary when it comes in, which will be from 2028 to 2030. That will be really interesting.</p>

We engaged with the OGP but it did not have a framework in place and it was unsure how to develop one, so we had to make a decision to go ourselves. We developed our own system and then engaged with the OGP, which has adopted our framework as guidelines for other agencies, without them being totally specific because it is a new and developing world.</p>

          <p eId="para_493">I thank Deputy Dolan. I have some questions. I welcome the witnesses again. I will focus first on carbon tax, in particular, the chapter from the Comptroller and Auditor General, which is quite concerning. It found that only 61% of the sum allocated could be verified as being spent on target schemes. Mr. Cody has said previously, and at this meeting, that Revenue is the collection agency in relation to that. It is extremely concerning that 39% of money collected from a scheme, the primary stated purpose of which was to try to change consumers' behaviours and which has the second purpose of ring-fencing that money for measures to improve the welfare of some of the most vulnerable in the State and for other schemes to meet our carbon targets, cannot be verified as doing that. The figure for carbon tax collected between 2020 and 2023 is €1.36 billion. Do we have a figure for carbon tax collected in 2024?</p>

          <p eId="para_508">Essentially, the carbon tax element of fuel tax has been increasing over the last few years. The non-carbon has stayed the same. Every year we publish details of tax receipts. There is a huge impact here in relation to vehicle tax as well. The growth in non-combustion engine vehicles is part of this measure. It would really be a job for the Department of the environment, I presume, to publish data on use. We publish details. We have done some interesting tax gap analysis in relation to fuel because the other challenge around fuel we have is fuel laundering and diesel washing, and that is all linked.</p>

We do report on releases of fuel and certainly the releases from the bonded warehouse, the excise warehousing system, are fairly static. They are certainly not increasing as much as the economic activity in the country has increased. Again, that would be for other bodies to report on. The only thing to add here is that generally the taxes we collect are transferred to the Exchequer. There is very little hypothecation, as it is called. This is a kind of hypothecation-lite in that it was not legislated for.</p>

          <p eId="para_511">I get that. It is extremely concerning that the stated purpose of this was to change consumer behaviour and it has not. The money has not gone in to trying to help those who need it most, in terms of giving them the means to transition to more energy efficiency, whether it is electric vehicles or retrofitting. There are serious concerns there and it is something on which we intend to follow up.</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_516">
          <from> Mr. Niall Cody<recordedTime time="2025-12-11T13:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_594">I think it influences the debate a little like we have had a debate here about whether, if we had more resources to look at this, we would be able to close the tax gap. That is the purpose. We are not opposed to the concept of tax gap analysis and we have done it in relation to, as I mentioned, mineral fuel. The purpose, from a tax administration point of view, is to identify a tax gap but also to identify where that gap is and, ultimately, who the people are. I think there are issues around what will happen with VAT modernisation, which will give a more global view of transaction-by-transaction data, and you can apply analytics to that. I think there will be future developments in relation to tax gap analysis in Ireland, and I think there is stuff we can do and have done based on the PAYE modernisation because we get details of every pay cheque issued by employers. The problem with the PAYE payroll tax gap is that what we do not get is the cash that is paid off record or under the counter, and that is what you are trying to measure with a tax gap analysis: what a shadow economy is. We are doing some work with our PAYE data because if you look at patterns you can see that these five businesses are roughly the same, these four have wage levels of X and this one has wage levels of Y. A subject that has come up a lot here in Ireland over the past couple of years is the reporting on non-taxable benefits. We have full data for that, and that has shown a very interesting potential gap. What I would love - I said this earlier around rental - is full data on everything, but the tax gap tries to measure the thing that is not recorded. It is a bit like drugs. It is a bit like all that.</p>

          <p eId="para_643">Okay. I will briefly ask another question, Chair, if I may. I thank Mr. Cody for his information on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_644"> On the derelict property tax that was announced in budget 2026, vacancy is a major issue across the country. We have to use every tool possible to try to bring vacant buildings back into use. What has frustrated some politicians, including me, in relation to this is the lead-in time. It is going to take approximately two years to get this up and running. Is that at Revenue's end in the sense that it will take it that length of time to administer this or is that more a policy decision?</p>

          <p eId="para_645">The Minister announced that the derelict site levy was going to be replaced by a derelict property tax. Obviously, the Department has engaged with us and asked us if we would do it. There is legislation required, but there is also significant design. The challenge is that to have a properly functioning derelict property tax, we need a register of derelict properties.</p>

          <p eId="para_647">That requires the local authorities having identified and registered the properties. One of the challenges we have as an administration is that a tax has to be applied in the same way to similar buildings in different parts of the country. Our concern is to ensure that our local authorities and the Department of housing have the groundwork done because it would not withstand a constitutional challenge if we were collecting a tax and one local authority had every derelict property on its register and another had only a proportional amount. There is, therefore, really significant groundwork to be done, but not by us.</p>

          <p eId="para_649">Mapping it and registering it. From an IT perspective, we would have to set that up, but we have set up things previously.

          <p eId="para_659">We have given the committee the updated figures. That has cost us just over €12 million to date.

          <p eId="para_660">That is fair enough too. I will go back to the carbon tax because it is a very specific tax. We always see these arguments that road taxes should be spent on roads, and we know that is not the case. With carbon tax, we kind of figure that it might be more the case. Why is there such difficulty spending the money in the areas that we feel it should have been spent on? Mr Cody might say that is outside his realm, but what are his thoughts or views on it?</p>

          <p eId="para_679">It is a very different challenge. It is a legitimate product. It is not like the white powder of cocaine or ecstasy pills and you know what it is. If this goes to a hospital, it has a completely different use than if it ends up at a house party with children. It presents its own difficulties.

          <p eId="para_680">We sized 100 kg of it in 2020. That was the start of us identifying this as a process. Up to 7 November this year, we seized just short of 35,000 kg - from 100 kg to 35,000 kg. We have seized a total of 214,000 kg and the cost of disposal is very close to catching up on the cost of the<i> MV Matthew</i>. It has cost us €8.6 million. That is the challenge. When "Prime Time Investigates" asked if we would participate in the programme, we said absolutely. They were doing the interviews in Dublin Port and I think what was going to be a half-hour interview involved RTÉ being down in Dublin Port for something like five hours. If you go down to Dublin Port and see the scale of the container activity that comes through it, ultimately all these things are about looking for a needle in a haystack. It is so driven by intelligence and co-operation with our partner organisations nationally and internationally.</p>

          <p eId="para_681">It ties into the Comptroller and Auditor General's opening statement about the level of tax evasion and that there is no official estimate. Is that like my earlier questions, where there is almost a tax gap? Is there a tax evasion gap? Is there no method of calculating what might be the tax evasion versus the more formal tax gap? There is no official estimate of the level of tax evasion in Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_690">I will limit this to the tax side rather than duty and smuggling and all that. Our main interest is that taxpayers voluntarily comply. To do so, they are required to keep proper books and records of their activity. That is a legal obligation. That is really what we are interested in - looking at their books and records. We establish from their returns and our analysis of third-party information that the books and records are an accurate reflection of the business activity. Unfortunately, there are cases where the books and records are a fiction and do not reflect that. We are trying to identify those cases. For the serious tax evasion cases, we will use our powers under the legislation to get third-party information and access to bank accounts. That is what we are interested in.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">We are interested in facts and figures. We have powers that we use, some of which are subject to court approval. We are also very interested when people want to make what we call "good citizen reports", which are tax evasion information reports. We get a reasonable number of those good citizen reports, which range from completely anonymous but very well informed up to protected disclosures by employees or agents of an employer. We are specifically provided for in the protected disclosures legislation. It applies to us in relation to our own employees. If an employee of a business makes a protected disclosure about tax evasion, they make it to us.</p>

Our director of internal audit is the protected disclosure officer for Revenue. She happens to be here.

Over the last couple of years it has been brought to my attention that a number of websites which have cropped up over the years are selling nitrous oxide and are very much targeting a specific audience that would not be ice cream sellers, in retail or anything like that. They are targeting young people. These substances are sold in different flavours now. Some of the messages on the websites say that packages can be delivered discreetly to people's homes, which tells me that a particular audience is being targeted.

          <p eId="para_736">The figures have been fairly similar going back to 2013. While the deferral regime is there and there is an income threshold, people tend not to use this. The LPT register is a unique register. A higher proportion of elderly people is covered by it. They tend not to like to leave the liability on record.</p>

          <p eId="para_749">I will let the Deputy in shortly. I am a very lenient Chair. Bogus self-employment is an issue that we, as a committee, intend to come back to in the new year. I appreciate that it is not one of the items we had proposed to discuss here today, but it is an area I have a particular interest in. I look forward to a more comprehensive engagement on it with Revenue and the Department of Social Protection in the new year.</p>
          <p eId="para_750"> There have been some recent developments. The Karshan judgment consolidated all relevant Irish and EU case law into one five-step test for determining employment status. Does Revenue accept that position, given the ruling that has come down?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_668">
          <from> Mr. Niall Cody<recordedTime time="2025-12-11T14:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_751">We had one brief discussion on this the last time I was at the Committee of Public Accounts. The reality is, as I outlined that day, that we took the Karshan case. We won the Karshan case. This morning, I was reading an article on a commentary on the implications of classification in the media, in which one side was saying Revenue was taking too strict an interpretation of the Karshan judgment and the union side was saying that we were absolutely right. What I would say is that we are not taking a strict interpretation of the Karshan judgment. We are applying the Karshan judgment.</p>
          <p eId="para_752"> The reality is that the Karshan judgment has fundamentally changed the understanding in this area. I was reading an article by an employment lawyer, who was saying it will probably not make that much of a difference. This is an area that will be subject to significant dispute. The Supreme Court, in the judgment, said that this is not the end of it and that there will be further cases. I know the committee is interested in this, and the chapter is in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report. There are three State bodies involved: Revenue in relation to tax, the Department of Social Protection in relation to social insurance, and the WRC in relation to employment rights. What I have seen in my career is that the challenge has increasingly been about employment rights rather than fiscal matters. The tax treatment is nearly the same either way. We are very active in the area.</p>

          <p eId="para_753">I appreciate that. The difficulty is that, for decades, Revenue and the Department of Social Protection have issued opposite determinations on the same facts under the same law.</p>

          <p eId="para_758">I think the Karshan case is really good. On the last day, I actually brought the Karshan judgment with me. It is something like 190 pages. It was on the particular facts and circumstances of the case. The challenge in this area is that we have a framework that is available to everybody, so for people who want to construct something on a different side, it provides that framework to ensure it is not employment. That is the challenge we have in this area. Legislation in the UK has changed in ways that it has not changed here, but they have not sorted it. We would be very concerned about some low-income workers but, on the other side, there are also very high earners in this sphere. I think the fallout of Karshan will be a lot more use of limited liability, and we have no provision to look through limited liability.</p>

          <p eId="para_760">My question relates to a topic that came up here a few weeks ago. It is a national topic.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">There were question marks over the ownership of many of the IPAS centres and how they were constituted in contracts ahead of time, when they should not necessarily have got contracts or went to companies but no one necessarily knew who was behind them. </p>
          <p eId="para_762"> Has Revenue had dealings where it has come across some of these companies, and has it had any issues from a tax compliance perspective? Have they approached the organisation from a tax perspective and what sort of interactions is Revenue having with those contracts? As a State, we have given over €1.2 billion in one year. That is a huge amount of money, so I want to ensure they are being treated and are treating themselves correctly as regards tax and Revenue. Has Revenue had any dealings like this?</p>

          <p eId="para_763">We are very active in the sector. I spoke to Deputy Murphy earlier about our realigned structure. Our medium enterprises division is primarily and proactively looking at payments. One of the things we are always concerned about is when State money is going out, capital investment and big investment programmes, that we ensure tax compliance. </p>
          <p eId="para_764"> There are legal provisions regarding tax clearance but the reality is tax clearance is a low bar for some entities where you are established to do this. We look at the groups involved and have had interventions, where required, on them. It is an area we consistently look at to see money that flows out from the State and any tax liabilities arising from that are done properly. That is our role in that area, but we are active and pay close attention to new investments. </p>

For heritage properties in the filing period 1 September 2024, there were 13 beneficiaries and the total was €4.4 million. In all previous years, there were less than ten and we never publish less than ten. The amounts range over the period and number of years, with the highest amount being just short of €4 million. There are donations of heritage properties in the State and they are published annually in our annual report. As regards heritage properties, there is no provision in the law to publish it. </p>

          <p eId="para_7">The witnesses are all very welcome. I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are switched off or on silent mode. To start, I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practices of the Houses as regard references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence. The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and by statute, by absolute privilege. This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting. However, witnesses are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that it is not abused. Therefore, if statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative they comply with such directions.</p>
          <p eId="para_8"> Members and witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses of the Oireachtas or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I also ask that members and witnesses refrain from commenting on matters that may be the subject of live criminal investigations. Members are reminded of the provision of Standing Order 218, that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits or the objectives of such policies. Furthermore, it is not the role of this committee to make findings of fact about a person who is not a Member of the Oireachtas that could impinge on their good name and reputation and I ask members to be mindful of this in their examination of the issues during questioning.</p>
          <p eId="para_9"> The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee. He is accompanied this morning by Ms Mary Henry, deputy director at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>
          <p eId="para_10"> We are engaging this morning with representatives from the University of Limerick to examine the following matters: financial statements 2021 and 2022 and the Comptroller and Auditor General's special report No. 117 - University of Limerick property acquisitions in Limerick city. Specific areas of interest flagged by this committee include governance and associated due diligence and the university's purchase of the Limerick city centre site in 2019 and houses for student accommodation at Rhebogue in Limerick in 2023.</p>
          <p eId="para_11"> We are joined by the following representatives from University of Limerick: Professor Brigid Laffan, chancellor; Professor Shane Kilcommins, acting president; Mr. John Kelly, corporate secretary; and Mr. John Field, acting chief finance and performance officer. We are also joined by the following representatives from the Higher Education Authority: Dr. Alan Wall, chief executive officer, and Mr. Ciarán McCaffrey, head of capital funding, and from the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science: Mr. Paul Lemass, assistant secretary, and Mr. Keith Moynes, assistant secretary. They are all very welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_12"> I call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to deliver his opening statement. </p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_2">
          <from> Mr. Seamus McCarthy<recordedTime time="2024-10-03T09:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_13">When the representatives of the University of Limerick were last before the committee on 9 May 2024, I outlined the key financial results for the 2021-2022 year of account. I do not propose to repeat that presentation this morning. It is regrettable that the audited financial statements for the 2022-2023 year of account are not yet available for the committee. I completed my review of the audit work around mid-June, and cleared the accounts for signing, subject to a number of issues, including two proposed impairments, being finalised. I am waiting for the university to present final accounts approved by the governing authority, so that I can present my report on the 2022-2023 year of account.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> Members will recall there have been a number of well-publicised control and governance issues in the University of Limerick in recent years. This and the previous committee inquired repeatedly about issues raised by whistleblowers and about the way concerns raised had been dealt with. In 2018, I presented a special report on the way the university had handled aspects of remuneration of certain senior staff members. Issues reported included higher-than-normal awards of professional added years for pension purposes; the admission of staff of a subsidiary company to the University of Limerick’s pension scheme; and the circumstances of the award of severance terms to two former staff members. In the latter case, we found that the university had previously misrepresented the terms of the severance deals to my office, to the committee and to the Department of further and higher education. In audit certificates in recent years, I have also drawn attention to issues such as non–compliant procurement; senior management overriding of controls; and a severance arrangement with a former president, which the university argued was not a severance. Some of the issues referenced triggered inquiries and reports commissioned by the university into its governance and controls. All of this provides a relevant context for consideration of the special report on the university’s acquisitions of property in Limerick city.</p>
          <p eId="para_15"> I commenced the special report being considered by the committee today because of the constraints around publication of the KPMG report commissioned by the university into the 2019 acquisition at Honan’s Quay. As part of that, we reviewed the 2022-2023 Rhebogue acquisition to establish whether better processes had been implemented. In April 2019, the university applied to the Higher Education Authority for capital funding towards the development of a premises in the centre of Limerick city. This included a proposal to purchase a site for the development in the city’s opera quarter at an estimated cost of €3 million. However, the university instead approved the purchase of a property at the nearby Honan’s Quay for over €8 million. As we found no evidence of any additional benefits to be gained by the purchase of the Honan’s Quay property compared to that at the opera quarter that would warrant the increased purchase cost, it is difficult to see how that purchase represented value for money.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> The university did not obtain a formal valuation report on the property prior to purchase. This was contrary to provisions of the public spending code. Nevertheless, it was represented to the university’s governing authority that a valuation report had been obtained and the governing authority did not request the valuation report.</p>
          <p eId="para_17"> An independent valuation of the Honan’s Quay property in 2023 concluded the university had paid around one third more than the market value in 2019, even allowing for any special interest it might have in the property.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">The university has proposed that a €3 million impairment charge, or write-down loss, be recognised in its 2022-2023 annual financial statements. A key concern is that, more than five years on, the university remains without a clear development and funding plan for the Honan’s Quay property.</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> The university was approached by a developer in late 2021 regarding a proposal for the construction of houses on a site in Rhebogue which would be either leased or sold to the University for use as student accommodation. Despite the adoption of new property acquisition procedures by the university following the Honan’s Quay acquisition, there were significant failures in the due diligence associated with the Rhebogue development. Prior to the purchase, planning advice from relevant professionals was not conclusive, but the university did not seek clarification from the local authority. In December 2023, the university received a warning letter from Limerick City and County Council stating that the change of use to student accommodation without planning permission may represent an unauthorised development. At the time I was signing the report, this matter had not been resolved.</p>
          <p eId="para_20"> In March 2022, the university commissioned formal valuation reports to provide the open market value of the Rhebogue properties. In August 2022, the purchase price proposed to the governing authority was based on the net rental yield method for valuing property. Even though the accommodation was generally configured as a standard housing development, information on the sales price comparison method for valuing property was not provided to the governing authority, and this would have yielded a much lower valuation.</p>
          <p eId="para_21"> The university signed a contract to purchase the houses in August 2022 that required only a peppercorn deposit. It concluded the purchase on 10 October 2023, at a cost of €11.4 million, representing an average purchase price of almost €572,000 per house. The university failed to identify that the purchase was also liable to stamp duty, resulting in an additional cost of over €1 million. A March 2024 independent valuation of the Rhebogue property indicates that the university probably paid significantly more than it should have. The university has proposed to recognise an asset impairment charge of €5.2 million in its 2022-23 annual financial statements.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> The report makes recommendations for improvements in the university’s property acquisition policies, procedures and controls. These have been accepted by the university and now need to be properly and effectively implemented.</p>

          <from> Professor Shane Kilcommins<recordedTime time="2024-10-03T09:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_23">University of Limerick has many fine achievements to its name. Despite recent controversies, its academic standing is unquestioned. This is a testament to our staff and students, and to the vision of those who, by sheer force of will, brought University of Limerick into being more than 50 years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> As the acting Accounting Officer, I am here to meet the statutory obligations of that office to report to the Committee of Public Accounts, the Comptroller and Auditor General and, of course, the university itself in respect of these property acquisitions and the loss of public funds they occasioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> As the acting president of the university, I wish to take this opportunity to address our stakeholders and state again that I am deeply sorry for what has happened and the damage that the transactions have done to UL's reputation, to morale and for the restrictions that have been placed on our institutional independence, which all universities cherish.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> In the briefing document submitted to the committee last week, I provided significant detail related to the Honan’s Quay and Rhebogue properties. I also provided particulars related to the status of various processes and reviews, whether ongoing or concluded. Finally, I outlined the steps we have taken and continue to take along with our regulators and key stakeholders to regain institutional grip and rebuild trust and confidence in the university's ability to manage its own affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> It is now just over five months since the university was last before the public accounts committee. The period in between has been very challenging for the university as we worked through the inevitable fallout from the Rhebogue transaction. A series of reviews, including the section 64 review, were put in train by the Higher Education Authority, HEA. We have worked closely with that authority to provide the team with all the assistance possible. The scope and the scale of these reviews has been both broad and deep, and they have understandably gone far beyond what happened at Rhebogue. We facilitated these reviews while also ensuring that our commitment to our core mission of academic excellence did not falter. I am grateful to the many people within the university who supported these endeavours.</p>
          <p eId="para_28"> Ensuring that these reviews are comprehensive is important because they provide us with the information that will help strengthen our foundation for the future. I am confident that although this process was extremely difficult, UL will undoubtedly be the better for it in the long run.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> On UL’s delegation, the chancellor of the university, Professor Brigid Laffan, is in attendance today. The chancellor chairs the new governing authority, which was appointed following the enactment of the Higher Education Authority Act 2022. The chancellor will address the committee on the process of change and accountability which the governing authority will lead.</p>
          <p eId="para_30"> I am also accompanied by my colleagues, Mr. John Field, the acting chief financial and performance officer, and Mr. John Kelly, the corporate secretary. Together, we will answer any question put to us by the committee truthfully and in as much detail as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> We have also shared with the committee in our briefing document the steps taken towards reform since we last met and we look forward to discussing that further with members this morning.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> On the status of the reviews, a section 64 review was submitted to the HEA in accordance with the requirements of the statute. Deloitte was appointed to undertake this review following a competitive process. The HEA has provided feedback on the review following its submission, and the governing authority has now submitted a draft that reflects the key impactful changes that are needed following the findings and recommendations made by the Deloitte report. The chancellor will briefly address these in her opening statement.</p>
          <p eId="para_33"> Forvis Mazars was engaged by the HEA to undertake an independent review of the culture at the university. The university expects to receive this report very shortly from the HEA.</p>
          <p eId="para_34"> An experienced barrister has been appointed to conduct a review of protected disclosures at University of Limerick. He has met with a number of individuals, including those who made disclosures and those who were appointed to oversee the various processes of investigation put in place as a result. The field work for this investigation is nearing completion and a report is now under preparation.</p>
          <p eId="para_35"> On Honan's Quay and Rhebogue, although these were separate transactions, and they are treated as such in the UL briefing document, I will address them together because the similarities in governance shortcomings are both remarkable and stark. First, the university significantly overpaid for both assets, and this has resulted in two separate financial impairments in its financial statements for the year 2022-2023. In the case of Honan’s Quay, the amount of the impairment was €3.044 million and, in the case of Rhebogue, the amount is higher at €5.225 million. This represents a cumulative loss of €8.269 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_36"> Second, the approach to planning was deficient in both cases. Prior to the purchase of the former Dunnes Stores site, no planning advice was taken regarding the change of use. In the case of Rhebogue, professional advice was taken, which suggested that existing planning, which was for residential dwelling houses, was not sufficient. This did not accord with the developer’s advice, and so the situation was uncertain. In both transactions, the extent of the planning risks were not highlighted to the key decision-making committees of the university.</p>
          <p eId="para_37"> Third, purchase price is a critical issue in any acquisition by a public body and it must be informed by a negotiating strategy. In the case of Honan’s Quay, the university had no written valuation. In the case of Rhebogue, the financial analysis presented to the governing authority represented a justification of the maximum price that the university could reasonably pay for the assets as student accommodation. As pointed out by the C and AG, as a negotiating stance, this was detrimental to the university’s and taxpayers' interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_38"> The final point I wish to highlight is that concerns were raised in the form of protected disclosures in respect of both transactions. In the case of Honan’s Quay, the decision to purchase was made with undue haste and with limited opportunity for the involvement of the buildings and estates division. That division should have led the acquisition. In the case of Rhebogue, again buildings and estates had limited involvement, and the serious concerns it raised in respect of the transaction were not represented to the governing authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_39"> As highlighted by the C and AG, in both cases the protected disclosures were managed in a tightly legal-focused way, which did not take account of the more general implications of the disclosures for the university’s system of control and decision-making. This is a key reflection point for the university, and our future approach to such matters will be completely different.</p>
          <p eId="para_40">It is noteworthy that, in the aftermath of the Honan’s Quay transaction, the university gave assurance to various stakeholders, including the HEA, the Department of higher education, and this committee that this would not happen again. UL informed the public accounts committee on 18 May 2023 that it was a much-changed institution, yet at the same time, the Rhebogue acquisition had already progressed in a way that did not accord with its new policy on the acquisition of property. As acting Accounting Officer, I am acutely aware we owe the bodies to which we are accountable a legal as well as moral duty of candour.</p>
          <p eId="para_41"> It is in everyone’s interest that UL is properly run. I assure the committee and the university community that, while we are only at the beginning, there are encouraging signs to that effect. Since our last appearance before the public accounts committee five months ago, the university has taken a number of proactive measures to start this transformation process, including a reset of the executive committee, improved transparency within our community and with stakeholders, enhanced governance, open communications and the adherence to due process. We have fully accepted the recommendations of the C and AG report and are committed to implementing these findings as we drive this process forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_42"> As acting president, I am confident that both the executive committee and the governing authority are committed to working together in partnership with the HEA. We will take all appropriate steps to achieve transformation and cultural reform in order that UL develops a strong system of governance, high performance and accountability.</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_5">
          <from> Professor Brigid Laffan<recordedTime time="2024-10-03T09:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_44">I am grateful for the opportunity to provide the committee with a brief statement in addition to that provided by the acting president. I was one of the first students of NIHE, and UL matters a great deal to me. During my time as an undergraduate, I grew up there and UL quite literally grew up around me. I accepted the invitation to become chancellor because of the opportunities, academic career and life experience UL gave me. It was transformative in my life and I wanted to give something back. The chancellor’s role has been nothing like I expected it to be. At just my second meeting as chair, Rhebogue was placed on our meeting agenda and it has not left the agenda since, nor, I have accepted, is it unlikely to for the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p eId="para_45"> Since we last appeared before the committee, the president has resigned, providing stability and certainty to the university and allowing us an opportunity to commence the process of resetting the executive committee. We have also greatly strengthened, with external expertise, the committees that support the governing authority, in particular audit and risk, finance, people and culture. As the committee knows, we are now subject to a section 64 review.</p>
          <p eId="para_46"> When I last addressed the university community in March, I said the institution would be subject to extreme oversight. Although that description was perhaps a little too strong, it is clear that the HEA will have direct involvement in UL’s institutional governance for at least the next few years. Although I am a strong advocate of independence and university autonomy, UL could not have expected any other outcome given the governance failures, one after another, which characterised the Honan’s Quay and Rhebogue purchases.</p>
          <p eId="para_47"> Where are we at? The governing authority has submitted the section 64 review to the HEA. The review was conducted by Deloitte at arm’s length from both the executive committee and the governing authority. The obligation to report to the HEA under section 64, however, rests with the authority. In the feedback provided to us, the HEA challenged us to think critically about the findings and recommendations and what they would mean for UL. We were also asked to consider and prioritise the changes that would be most impactful. The governing authority has done what the HEA has asked, outlining what we think these impactful changes might be. It is now a matter for the HEA to consider the next steps and to chart a way forward in partnership with us and in accordance with its statutory oversight powers.</p>
          <p eId="para_48"> Let me give the authority’s views. I am conscious the HEA is currently deliberating on an appropriate course of action for the next phase, but I want to give the committee a brief outline of the authority’s reflections. Honan’s Quay and Rhebogue did not occur in a vacuum. Throughout this process we have been asking ourselves how it could be that, despite the change in leadership, so many of the shortcomings were repeated. This is not an easy question but the reports conducted provide us with insight. Certainly, there are structural deficiencies in our systems of governance but culture also played an important part. The governing authority is of the view that approaching reform solely through addressing findings and recommendations, which we will do, will not of itself bring about the change of the scale required. There is a need for deep-rooted cultural change, starting at the top. We are addressing this so that poor governance, similar to Honan’s Quay and Rhebogue, will not arise in the future. Any further lapses in governance would be utterly disastrous for UL’s recovery, and on my watch it will not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_49"> Turning to the future, we have four key recommendations. First, we need to establish a transformation programme with a dedicated change management support. There is a large body of recommendations that needs to be worked through<i>
						</i>diligently and systematically while also thinking about the bigger picture. Given<i>
						</i>the scale, UL will need to create a dedicated change programme. This will ensure the affairs of the university on a day-to-day basis will also continue. The governing authority will maintain direct oversight of its progress, supported by the audit and risk committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_50"> Second, the governing authority must model the behaviours that it wishes others to follow. It must be an exemplar of good governance and accountability and must set what I call “tone from the top”. The executive committee is also crucially important here. It will need to lead the cultural change programme on a day-to-day basis, and its members must be instigators, agents, and champions of institutional transformation.</p>
          <p eId="para_51"> Third is structures, processes and policies of governance. Working closely in partnership with the HEA, the governing authority will lead in the development of the implementation plan, addressing structures, processes and policies of governance with clear action owners, timelines and independent evaluation of progress. Fourth is the prioritisation of internal control, risk management and accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_52"> Based on discussions with the newly reconstituted audit and risk committee, I am aware there is a need to greatly strengthen the university’s second and third lines of defence. Risk and compliance require particular attention, and although much has already been done in respect of the former, the latter needs more time and investment. We now have a strong audit and risk committee, but internal audit will need to be significantly strengthened relative to the size and budget of the university.</p>
          <p eId="para_53"> The governing authority will drive a strong approach to accountability, both individual and collective. There will be zero tolerance for policy deviation and actions that cause the university reputational damage.</p>
          <p eId="para_54"> This concludes my opening statement. I am happy to assist the members and to<b>
						</b>address their questions.</p>

          <p eId="para_55">I thank Professor Laffan for her statement. To set out at the start of this meeting, the witnesses have been before this and previous committees a number of times, and one of the main issues we are examining is the C and AG's report. The findings are that there is no evidence of an evaluation report being submitted to the governing authority regarding the Dunnes Stores site, defective briefings were given to the governing authority that the witness chairs, and that there was deficient record keeping, inadequate assessment of tax implications, dismissal and override of legitimate arguments, a bias in favour of the acquisition, failure to comply with the principles of the public spending code and incomplete contracts. It is an awful picture. That is what we need to address this morning.</p>

At the outset, I will say that we seldom have such a stark report and statement from the C and AG, but given the severity of the issues at stake here, the witnesses are back five months later to discuss these accounts.

We are in the process of working with PwC to finalise the audit. The accounts have not been presented for approval to the governing authority yet because we are waiting for PwC to signal to us it is happy to sign off on the financial statements, and it has not done that yet.</p>

          <p eId="para_64">Yes, that is the primary reason. As I mentioned, all the field work is done and a draft set of financial statements is prepared. I think there is an acceptance that a final draft is fairly close, but matters connected with the reasons we are here today are the cause of the delay.</p>

          <p eId="para_65">From the perspective of the committee and on this point, I would argue that within five months of today, the witnesses might be back before us to discuss matters when the Comptroller and Auditor General gets the report done on those accounts given what we are discussing at length here today and just last May. I think we will need to look at those accounts in more detail.</p>
          <p eId="para_66"> Turning to the latter part of Professor Laffan's statement, I concur with the need for internal controls. Anybody who has followed this saga would be aware of it, to say the least. Reading the statement on the systems of internal control in the 2022 annual report last night, I was struck by the text under the "Risk Management" heading:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_67">The University has a robust Risk Management Framework in place that is subject to regular review to ensure it reflects best practice. The Framework includes clearly defined process for the identification of new risks and process for evaluating and managing existing risks.</p>
          <p eId="para_68"> In the context of our meetings today and last May, is that really a reflective statement for the university given what we know now?</p>

          <from> Professor Brigid Laffan<recordedTime time="2024-10-03T10:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_69">In my view, and I was not there when both those capital acquisitions were made, clearly the internal controls were not sufficient to ensure they did not happen. Therefore, no, it is not an accurate statement, but we have also worked very hard on risk management in the university over the last months. We have completely revamped the risk register and my colleagues can certainly give the Deputy the details on that.</p>

          <from> Mr. John Kelly<recordedTime time="2024-10-03T10:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_71">One of the things we have looked at very closely in this whole episode is the system of risk management in the university. There has been a fundamental risk register in the university, as is required, for many years. It contained a large number of risks but, in our view, and having reflected on Rhebogue, it did not reflect the most significant and important risk to a university, which is its reputation as a credential institution. Our fundamental risk register now, therefore, looks at these matters very carefully.</p>
          <p eId="para_72"> In the case of Rhebogue, it is all very well to have a fundamental risk register, but when somebody is progressing a transaction and taking it through, that person must have at the forefront of their mind what are the risks in relation to the transaction for the university, bearing in mind the risks on the fundamental risk register. I think people do not sometimes make the connections between the actions they are taking at a point in time and what the fundamental risks are and this was possibly a factor in the Rhebogue situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_73"> In that situation, my recollection is that the risks were in relation to cohesion in the community where the Rhebogue development was located and how the people there would react to having students in a close-knit community. Of course, that was a risk, but there were other risks pertinent to that transaction, including, for example, risks in relation to planning. As the Deputy will know, the situation with the planning is before An Bord Pleanála. It is uncertain how that will go. It may be a case where the planning application may be approved but it may not, and that would leave the university in a difficult situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_74"> The issue internally was that there was no visibility at all by the decision-making bodies of those risks. A judgment call was made in relation to those risks and it was represented that, essentially, the planning was in order. There were other issues as well, as the Deputy will know, in relation to the valuation methodologies and they formed part of the risk framework in this transaction. Again, the governing authority did not have that information available to it at the point at which it made a decision. </p>

          <from>Deputy Cormac Devlin<recordedTime time="2024-10-03T10:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_75">I appreciate that and that is true. In terms of the reforms that have been done, therefore, and this may be a query for Professor Kilcommins to speak to, I know they are under way and the report from Deloitte is dealing with that aspect, if I am not mistaken. The report from Mazars, then, is dealing with the cultural aspect.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_19">
          <from> Professor Shane Kilcommins<recordedTime time="2024-10-03T10:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_76">Building on what my colleague said, the first thing to say around this context is that the Deputy is absolutely right. Deloitte had 35 recommendations. These are around additional controls and include the two recommendations made by the Comptroller and Auditor General. A series of other recommendations are being made by Mazars in terms of culture. Additionally, what is going to be really important is that it will not be appropriate for the university to offer assurances in future. There will be a need for independent verification. This is one of the things we have been working closely with the HEA on. It is about mapping those through. This is the beginning point in terms of those recommendations being an anchor point from which we can reset the university to ensure there is a much better standard of governance and management.</p>
          <p eId="para_77"> To reassure the Deputy as well, to some extent that process has already commenced and it has commenced through a reset of the executive. Some of the people, and the Chair and some of the other members will be aware of this point, who were raising concerns from the outset are now part of the executive team and are contributing in this context. The university itself, through the strategic governance committee, has been bringing issues to light and bringing forward its own recommendations. This includes, and this was an issue raised in this committee previously, the lack of a valuation. It was the strategic governance committee of the university that brought that in and is providing an evidence-based way in which we can go forward. We have a valuation and a whole series of recommendations from that committee too. The committee is composed of a group of colleagues, including from the professoriate in the college and people from across a variety of different units, such as quality, buildings and estates and finance, working together to try to put recommendations in place that will move us in the direction of good governance.</p>

          <p eId="para_85">What I am really looking for is a collective figure. Mr. Kelly was right when he said that five such disclosures would be extremely high in any organisation, I presume, and that is a warning sign in itself. Prior to the year previous, since before all the purchasing and UL turned into some kind of property mogul, that was the problem. All these disclosures were being made. Who was the authorised officer to receive the protected disclosures?</p>

          <p eId="para_99">The example I wanted to give to the Deputy is that a consideration has already taken place around this matter at executive level. The position of the executive is that it supports the view taken by the Comptroller and Auditor General that our approach to protected disclosures has been overly narrow, overly legalistic and defensive. Going forward, it would be expected in a university, which is concerned with intellect, you would expect much more willingness to embrace ideas.</p>
          <p eId="para_100">Even if a decision is upheld on a narrow basis, we should look more broadly at the controls and the extent to which they are operating.</p>

We also commissioned the deep dive into the protected disclosures policies and activities of the university, so we are paying for that as well. We are also going back to look at capital expenditure over the past 15 years. There are approximately 1,300 documents to be reviewed.

I hear what the chancellor says, that there will be a greater involvement from the HEA, which, if the witnesses recall, is one of the criticisms I made the last time we met.

          <p eId="para_120">I understand the question, but if I can, I will take time to answer it. As the Deputy is aware, what we have done is we commissioned the section 64 report. We have been back and forth with the university over the past six months on that. We have made two site visits. We commissioned the flanking reports on the capital, the culture, and the protected disclosures. We are carrying out reviews ourselves on the valuations. All of those will come to a point in the next week or two, after which I will make a determination under the Act. I cannot determine what I am going to decide because I am told I cannot do that, but it is likely that some sort of plan will be drawn up.

          <p eId="para_128">I welcome all the witnesses who are before us again this morning. It is very difficult to imagine a more damning assessment by the Comptroller and Auditor General. The report sets out in stark detail what can only be described as a damning indictment of the financial practices at UL. The Chair went through some of them. There is significant evidence of loss in terms of value for money. No evidence regarding valuation reports was submitted to the governing authority. There was a bias in favour of the acquisition on unfavourable terms. There was a failure to comply with the principles of the public spending code. There were also incomplete contracts. Do the witnesses agree with the assessment that it is a damning indictment of the University of Limerick?</p>

Many of the issues relating to the student record system were not upheld. A feature of what was discussed today was that the manner in which the disclosure was dealt with and the manner in which the individual who made the disclosure was dealt with was not well handled by the university.</p>

There is a subcommittee of the executive that drives information to the executive, to the subcommittee of the governing authority, and into the governing authority. To date, 30 reports have been generated. At all points, information has been provided on where this project is, the risks around it and the governance around it. We are trying to move to a more simplified and automated system. Our system was initially overly complex. This project was about driving that complexity down. The key point about the student records system is that through that governance framework, we saw that the number of scenarios being generated and the complexity were increasing. A decision has been made to pause, not because there is instability in the system, but because as we move to a new, industry-led system, we have to continue to ensure that stability.

I made the comparison with my own university, which is Dublin City University, DCU. There is huge pride in the area at the work and the outreach DCU does. There would be a major level of enthusiasm surrounding any new capital project. I asked if that enthusiasm clouded the judgment of the authority. At the time I was told that was not the case. The major disappointment is that neither inner-city site ultimately became available or was progressed. There is now an unfunded proposal sitting there.

          <p eId="para_230">The first thing to say is that the university always wanted to be in the city. You can see that from two previous strategic plans. You can see it from the capital development plan for the period 2014 to 2018. You can see it from the opera quarter development. The university to some extent existed in distant isolation out in the suburbs, and it was important that it be in the city. It always had an aspiration. There have obviously been difficulties with due diligence around the Dunnes Stores site. Where it is currently is that the university obtained a valuation in December 2023. There is a process whereby it is being looked at primarily by means of a business case in partnership with Limerick City Council.

          <p eId="para_258"> I think it was at the last meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts that we dealt with the issue of the Dunnes Stores site. The university bought the building but now we know that it does not have the money to develop it. Not only did the university overpay for the wrong site and failed to get a valuation, but now it does not have the money to develop it. I have a rough idea how much houses cost where I live, as most people do. There has been a lack of critical thinking among people. I can understand people not understanding the cost of commercial buildings, but the average person understands the cost of housing in their own area. Where was the critical thinking on this? It is just incredible.</p>

          <p eId="para_260">It was placed on the agenda in the context that there may be a stamp duty liability that had not been foreseen. Due to the controversy around the KPMG report on the Dunnes Stores transaction, I referred that issue immediately to the audit and risk committee, which did an excellent job gathering material. Then we had the Niamh O'Donoghue report. So we did not allow Rhebogue to fester at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_261"> The Deputy is absolutely right about the cost of housing. I had never heard of Rhebogue before but I insisted on being driven to see the said houses. I am not a property valuer and I do not know much about property but I knew immediately, with no specialist expertise whatsoever, that the concern that we had overpaid was probably correct. It is also fair to say that the then chief finance officer was given a list of property prices in the Rhebogue area at the time and chose not to do anything about it.</p>

          <p eId="para_305">I have only had the power to do a section 64 review since the end of 2022, so it is all new to us. What we are seeing in UL is nothing like we are seeing at the other two. In the other two, there is an accounting issue and an information issue inside the university. The UL case has longer legs. As we are going, we are developing the protocols for doing this work. In this case, we kicked off the section 64 review in March. We went down to the university to conduct interviews right across the university. We spoke at length to staff, students, administrators, academics and the governing authority. On the basis of that, we redrafted our terms of reference to include matters like a review of the advices that were given, a deep dive into the culture of the university as part of the section 64 review, and an examination of subsidiaries. That extended beyond Rhebogue and Dunnes Stores. In parallel with that, we commissioned other reports on the protected disclosures. The barrister will report to us in the next couple of weeks on how UL handled the protected disclosures. There is also a major deep dive by Mazars into the culture of the university. The HEA tried to do this in 2016 but did not get a chance to complete it. That report will come to us as well. We are looking back over 15 years of capital expenditure. We are fully using our powers to get as big a picture as we can.</p>

Strictly speaking, I am not supposed to talk about what I will do next, but I will have all of the reports before me in the coming weeks and I will make a determination. The details will first have to be independently verified. I was given assertions about Dunnes Stores on which I relied. I cannot do that again.

Obviously this is why there is a focus of attention on the cultural change and protected disclosures.

We should have been looking at a thematic overview as to the issues that are arising and the type of controls that are put in place in a university. That is what one would expect but that is what we did not see. We do expect that this will change now very quickly. I mentioned to Deputy Devlin at the outset that we are already considering this at executive level. We cannot take a legal approach to this.

In the university it must be possible to question and have a deliberation on what is the best decision to make, whereas there almost was a closing down of questioning.

It is a ridiculous scenario and it is getting worse instead of better. Having listened to the discussion this morning, I am concerned about the €10 million that has been spent on the student portal. I am concerned because I am getting reports that the university has upwards of 18,000 students, and clearly many of them know who is on the public accounts committee, and the information I have is that good money is being thrown after bad. Having spent €10 million, UL may well end up having to spend €20 million or €30 million to redo the whole portal. I am asking a very straight question. Does the university know if it has had value for money and that the portal is where it wants it to be? I understand it is a very important part of the university's operational infrastructure but was it clear from the outset that it could not be fixed and it needed to be completely overhauled at the cost of €30 million? Is the university going to spend €30 million now having already spent €10 million? Professor Kilcommins should bear in mind that he will be here again at this time next year, and maybe before then.</p>

I can say that the student records system has been in a very tight governance framework. We have been looking to implement the recommendations that were made in 2015. As we have mapped through those, we have put approximately 30 reports into the audit and risk committee, flagging where we are at, the milestones reached and risks.

          <p eId="para_398">Before I go into questioning, it occurs to me that there is not an answer that could be produced for the committee to the question on the amount of money this governance issue is going to cost the taxpayer. We have it in black and white in terms of what it is costing us in impairments and so on, but I would love to know how much it cost to produce the special report for the C and AG. I have been part of three committee sessions on this issue. A huge amount of back room work goes into that by the secretariat of the committee as well all the work we did not get to because we were dealing with this. Then, when we look at section 64, Dr. Wall is telling us about the considerable resource the Higher Education Authority, HEA, is putting into it. The actual amount of money the taxpayer is putting into this issue and the lack of governance at University of Limerick, UL, is astonishing. We are not going to get to the bottom of that. We will not get a full figure for that, but I want to outline that before I began the questioning.</p>
          <p eId="para_399"> I will pick up where Deputy Verona Murphy left off. I read section 1.5 of Professor Laffan's opening statement in which she talked about how the president has resigned. Being honest, it is a startling omission not to mention that she resigned as president but still remains within the university. Can Professor Laffan tell me what grade?</p>

          <p eId="para_400">That was provided to the committee in the background documentation for the meeting. One also has to be mindful of the contracts that individuals have with the university.

          <p eId="para_406">Yes, indeed. She is a professor of visual culture. She is on sabbatical this year. It is the norm after a person has a senior position in the university to re-enter his or her research career and get a sabbatical, some of which is spent out of the country. That sabbatical year is funded from a person's salary. She will then return as professor of visual culture. It is also important to say that as professor of visual culture, she will not be short of things to do. There will be a programme of work. Both-----</p>

          <p eId="para_409">I can tell Professor Laffan that if people from any of the technological universities are watching this debate, who are killing themselves to get professorial roles in place, which Deputy Verona Murphy will know well about in the context of South East Technological University, SETU, it will hugely stick in their craw. I accept what Professor Laffan is saying, but it is very difficult to accept from a taxpayers' point of view that somebody who has been asked to step down - we are glad to note that she has recovered sufficiently from her illness - is now on sabbatical and is on €175,000.</p>

          <p eId="para_410">These things are matters of judgment and matters of the stability of a very large and very important Irish institution with a very large budget. I think the Deputy would agree that it is important that we return this institution to stability and allow it to face its future - a future in which it can flourish. I fully accept what the Deputy has said, but this is a matter of judgment and a matter of what is in the best interests of the university at a point in time. There are no ideal outcomes for any institution when it finds itself in the trouble in which University of Limerick found itself.</p>

          <p eId="para_411">I have reviewed both opening statements, and what I found difficult to accept was this idea that there was a level of benign incompetence that happened here and that we should accept that a bunch of bad decisions were made by people who were acting in good faith.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">There was a deliberately manufactured sense of haste in both of these cases. They were brought to the governing authority with the idea that action must be taken immediately because the monorail is moving on if quick action is not taken. Have we asked and answered the basic question: <i>qui bono</i>? Who benefited from this? I find it difficult to accept that these were just bad decisions. Nothing I have seen in the opening statements begins to identify the motivating force behind this. </p>

          <p eId="para_415"> I want to ask Dr. Wall about section 64. I know he is in a peculiar position because he is expecting this process to come to a conclusion relatively soon and therefore he cannot speak to us too much more about it. Compared to the interactions previously when Dr. Wall did not have those statutory powers, has he identified a cultural shift in the organisation? Obviously, he arrived with more powers under the new statute. Did he find that he was dealing with a different institution in terms of its openness and its willingness to engage?</p>

          <p eId="para_416">In fairness to the institution, I did. There is a history of the HEA dealing with the institution, which predates my time there, where that would not have been the case and a more pugilistic approach would have been taken to any intervention by the HEA. There might have been a desire to obscure, to delay or in some way to derail any actions that the HEA was anxious to do. There was a quickness on the part of UL and other institutions to point out the legal deficits of any kind of approach the university was subject to. This has not been our experience. Our relationship has not just been one of swapping letters. We deliberately went to the campus and made ourselves available to anyone who wanted to speak to us. We got a very clear insight into the cultural issues that people are talking about.</p>
          <p eId="para_417"> Deputy Murphy has referred to the reasons I might have not to believe some of the things I am told in UL, given the previous experiences when I was told things that simply were not true. Over the past six months, my experience has been confidence building, as we have worked through this process. Let me say that it is a very invasive process, for the first time in the history of the State, but we are getting full co-operation from the university. There is a sense in the university that owning these issues is the way forward. This is an autonomous institution; it has a governing authority and has specific requirements in law under the Universities Act 1997 and under the spending code that it was not paying attention to.

          <p eId="para_421">I can come in on that. The Comptroller and Auditor General is referring to a previous president's contract which did not include a notice provision. Every other contract in the university would always have had such a provision. It was very surprising that it was not included in that particular contract. This goes back to 2017 or 2018.

          <p eId="para_462">We have a professor earning €175,000 for a job that does not exist. We have a site in the middle of Limerick which was bought for €5 million over its valuation. It is not in use and there is no plan or finance for it, so it sits there like a white elephant. In Rhebogue, 3 km from the university, we have 20 houses that were bought for well in excess of double the market value of houses in the area. We could go on and on.</p>
          <p eId="para_463"> I would like to come back to one of the things that surprises me with regard to the Rhebogue houses. I find it hard to get my head around the fact that this happened after all of the problems with curtains, sheets and crazy ideas about buying a house here in Dublin, and after we went through everything with the Dunnes Stores transaction. You would say to yourself that procedures must now be put in place and people have to get their act together. </p>
          <p eId="para_464">It sounds very complicated, and Deputy Ó Cathasaigh has outlined all of the various reports, but it is very straightforward to me. Of course, these reports had to be done but, as a layperson, I know that you check the stamp duty and the planning permission when buying or selling property. It is very basic. Any Joe or Mary Soap would know that, as would their solicitor. There is mention of deficient record-keeping, tax implications and the absence of a valuation. As I said the last day UL was in here, there is something I cannot get my head around as regards Rhebogue. If I was going to buy a house somewhere, I would go on Daft.ie or some other website or I would look in the windows of local auctioneers to see what houses were making in that area. We are buried in reports here. We accept that they were necessary but they work out as being expensive. These reports seek to find out why these basics were not adhered to. Mr. Kelly is the corporate secretary.</p>

If we can put four students in a house, that works out at more than €130,000 each. It was decided to pay that price for it. The public spending code is clear that you buy at the lowest price possible, just as everybody else would. The fact is that it was just swept to one side and the prices were jacked up.

          <p eId="para_501">The presentation represented the transaction as following the policy. I was not involved in any shape, manner or form in the transaction prior to it coming to the governing authority. I was not on the project team that brought it to the governing authority. Essentially, I was provided with a paper that had gone through the executive committee of the governing authority and the president requested me to bring it before the governing authority for approval. That was my involvement in it. I had no involvement in due diligence, legal matters or any of that. The sole request made of me was to bring it to the governing authority. As I said, it arrived with me on Friday, following that meeting of the executive committee, for presentation to the governing authority on Tuesday.</p>

          <p eId="para_502">At the start of the meeting, I quoted the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General. Sometimes you will find one or two issues or deficiencies but absolutely zero was right about this. It is just such basic stuff. This is a university. Sole traders going out to buy an extra unit to house their business or whatever else would do all of these things in consultation with their solicitor and, perhaps, a planning agent. They might walk into the local authority, or pick up the phone to that authority, and ask whether there are planning implications if homes are used for student accommodation. I tell people all of the time to check with the local authority before they buy.</p>

          <p eId="para_503">That process was undertaken. Individuals on the project team did exactly what the Cathaoirleach has said. They sought architectural advice and planning advice. The planning advice was strongly against proceeding with the transaction on the basis that there was a serious question as to whether the planning permission for dwelling houses would suffice for student accommodation.</p>

          <p eId="para_512">Absolutely. The information should be brought to light. However, it is important that the members of the public accounts committee are aware that on 15 July, a detailed report on planning came in to the university, to the director of buildings and estates, flagging all the concerns about this transaction in terms of intensification of use and change of use. The director of buildings and estates was engaging directly with the chief commercial officer. The day before this came to the executive chairperson, they were still flagging concerns but this was not brought to the attention of the decision-makers.

The general principle at the moment, however, is that in agreement with the Department we have paused any capital works going into the University of Limerick.</p>

To modify that for student or university use would require substantial works. What is the estimate to bring this into use? There is no plan. That is the first thing. There is no strategic plan. The C and AG has outlined that. Within the circle at the top of the university, you must have some figure as to what it would take to bring this into some kind of purposeful building?

We will have to develop a number of options for the building now in terms of its potential and obviously evaluate and appraise which are the best options to proceed. Some work has commenced on that. In 2021, the university and Limerick City and County Council jointly made a submission to the urban regeneration and development fund. That submission was for a building with an estimated investment of close to €200 million. Approximately half of that was student accommodation and the other half was for teaching and research activities. That bid was only partially supported. It was supported for the purpose of progressing the business case and the appraisal further. It identified that we had not sufficient appraisal done. We are now in that process to appraise it.</p>

          <p eId="para_576">I take your point on that. The presentation spoke about this in terms of comparisons on building purpose-built student accommodation on the campus in the University of Limerick. It spoke about accommodation in other universities and presented this on the basis of a cost per bed, which is the issue that was discussed before the committee today. The presentation and the tenet of how information was presented on that paper was to show they compared favourably with the other options to develop student accommodation. That is the way the paper was presented.</p>

          <p eId="para_577">I do not know. I am going to move on and ask about one thing that jumped off the report of the C and AG. The developer approached first of all.

          <p eId="para_578">People would not have been snapping at the developers' heels to buy these for twice the price. There was no rush on this. </p>
          <p eId="para_579"> I had to reread this. I read it a few times because I thought "This cannot be right". Under the terms of the contract a deposit of just €10 was paid by the university on the contract signing date. That has to be unusual. Has the Comptroller and Auditor General seen that before? Is that usual? He obviously included it in the report.</p>

          <p eId="para_636">I would just call it that Mr. Kelly was misled and whatever the scenario will end up to be when the investigations are complete, I cannot understand that he was not forthcoming in saying that he was misled. I just do not understand that. It is very simple. We were misled but we asked the questions. When it comes down to Mr. Lemass and Dr. Alan Wall, I am voicing what I voiced at the last committee meeting.</p>

I am not going to name it because there is an investigation under way but I know that if, as a private citizen, I go to access money anywhere, I am asked for a tax clearance certificate. I am not saying their tax affairs are not in order but, certainly, their affairs are not in order and their governance is not in order. Until such time as they are, I do not want to see any co-operation from a county council.</p>
          <p eId="para_638"> I want to see the Dunnes Stores site sold because it has attached such a poor taste to the University of Limerick that I do not think it will ever shake it off. I think it should consider that this is something it never intended to buy, certainly not for the money that it cost. It would be much better to off-load it to someone who can take responsibility and then lease it back - let it be Limerick City and County Council off its own bat. However, it should get rid of it because it is already doing the university huge damage, no more than with Rhebogue. If the university is not going to get planning permission, it should sell off those houses, give them to the people who require them and get into an estate where it can build student accommodation under the planning, which it should do. I hope it is looking at sites so that may be the case. Is any site proposed in case the university does not get planning for Rhebogue? Is anybody looking at that?</p>
          <p eId="para_639"> We are losing the fact there are 18,000 UL students involved. This is all about the executive, who do not seem to be suffering at all.

They should start to make decisions that look like they are doing something that is actually beneficial for the college, as opposed to their own reputations. It has to stop. We need to know if Rhebogue is not going to receive planning, and the university is clearly in breach of planning. Has an enforcement order been brought on Rhebogue from the council?</p>

What is the university's position with regard to not getting planning? Where is the plan if those students are out on the street? How much is it going to cost? Where is the plan from UL to build student accommodation? It is clearly a problem for Dr. Wall because capital infrastructure planning and programmes are stopped.

          <p eId="para_650">When it was initially submitted, the proposal suggested it would cost between €50 million and €60 million, and that was in the original expression of interest that was issued in 2022. A revised expression of interest was then submitted and it suggested that property could be acquired for about €37.5 million. There are two reasons. The first is that there was an incongruence between the business proposal around the veterinary school, which the executive saw, and that proposal for €37.5 million. The second reason is in terms of capital acquisitions. Given where we are at in terms of section 64, it would not be appropriate to go further than that.</p>

          <p eId="para_668">At the moment, the former chief commercial officer is on special leave. The president is on sabbatical and on €175,000 for a position for which there is no course, given it has been established here today that the course she has been hired for is not available in the university. The former chief financial and performance officer has been on extended sick leave since 5 June 2023. Is that correct? The optics are not good. What we have discovered this morning is that a number of investigations are under way but what has happened in the past two years shows there are huge deficiencies. I will leave it at that.</p>
          <p eId="para_669"> I will move on to the issue of student accommodation. I understand students who live more than 60 km from the university campus can apply for student accommodation, which is fine. It is a huge issue for students, given the cost of accommodation in the cities, and Limerick is no different. Mr. Field said it cost approximately €9,000 per year.</p>

Has the university submitted any plans through the Higher Education Authority? Maybe Mr. Lemass from the Department can help us with this.

          <p eId="para_741">The Cathaoirleach and I would have come through long years of being members of local authorities in addition to being Members of the Dáil. What you always watch for is something you do not get advance warning of. You know that somebody wants to get something through with the least amount of attention paid to it when it is lobbed in at the last minute. It is a management tactic of, for example, the people on a governing authority whereby they do not give sufficient notice. It is like a gun to head or being told that if the money is not spent, it will be lost. The Cathaoirleach and I both recognise that from direct experience. Systems are put in place to make sure that a certain number of days' notice are given before something that substantial goes on an agenda. Was that not the case in this instance? Is it the case now?</p>

Also, it should be borne in mind that at the previous meeting of the governing authority, the chief commercial officer - this is in the minutes - said that a proposal might come out of cycle. The last meeting of the governing authority for the year in question was to take place in due course. The chief commercial officer said that a proposal might come forward in relation to these houses. The chief commercial officer flagged that and then it came at the very last minute, as I pointed out.</p>

          <p eId="para_787">That is all - there is no need. I am just pointing out where we are and perhaps those are the things that are required to be changed because it is costing a significant amount of taxpayers' money. It is not all just UL. It is not all garnered from students, foreign students, student fees and so on. At the end of the day, it is taxpayers' money, so we need to look at that. I am not going to get a sabbatical if I am sacked by the electorate. If I do not take my seat, I will probably get a sabbatical all right. The point is that we have to look at these things as value for money, which is the way I am looking at it.</p>

          <p eId="para_849">How is this figure for the development cost established? Does a developer just come in and say it is costing €200,000? I would probably have a good insight on the basis of it being a fact that once we go up in densities, etc., it is costly. At the same time, however, the Department has turned down a project priced at €130,000 per bed.</p>

That was a while ago now. In that endeavour, four full years ago, he drew attention to, and I will not read all the detail out, procurement non-compliance, and everything involved in that, and the purchase of a city-centre campus, which was an issue as early as then. Part of it was outlined in that work. Regarding the overriding of controls, an investigation was completed in November 2020 into a number of allegations made in 2017. Mr. Field was aware of it. He was the financial officer at that time, although not the chief financial officer.</p>

          <p eId="para_894"> Members have flagged one item for discussion under category B, correspondence from Accounting Officers and-or Ministers and follow-up to committee meetings. We received No. R2809 from Mr. Brendan Gleeson, who is the Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. It is dated 20 September. It is correspondence to the committee providing a response to information we requested at the meeting on 11 July. It is proposed to note and publish that. Is that agreed? Agreed. I have flagged this, as did Deputy Murphy. I raised this issue with Mr. Sheahan, the deputy chief veterinary officer at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine at the meeting. He said, "If you were to ask me even three weeks ago what were standards like within the slaughter plant in Straffan I would say that standards were very good within this slaughter plant". Now the Department is saying, in point No. 1 of this correspondence, that investigations go as far back as 2021 and 2022. It repeats it on page 4. It says there was no cause for concern, even though there were ongoing investigations. A good few of us, including Deputy Murphy, raised the matter of the 20,000 horses that have gone missing with no trace. The Department says that unfortunately there is no data source against which this proposition can be checked, verified or validated. The whole thing seems to be wide open, for want of a better word. Deputy Murphy indicated that she wanted to say something on this too.</p>

          <p eId="para_895">This is my constituency so I am aware of it. I am wondering what the status of the premises is at this point. Can we write back and ask for that? On page 3, point No. 6 states that following the Department's determination, the carcases must be destroyed as a result of unsatisfactory food chain information. It goes on to say that the Department issued a food fraud notification on 20 June through the EU rapid alert system for food and feed, RASFF, to the French authorities to advise of its suspicion of fraud associated with the plant, which had supplied products to a location in France, to enable French authorities to assess what action might be necessary or appropriate in France. Have the French authorities provided an update to the Department of agriculture or the Minister? What are the ongoing engagements?</p>
          <p eId="para_896"> The following page states that it does not reach the threshold for seizure of animals. That is at the top of page 4. That has been something that people are concerned about. It might be worth asking what the threshold is for seizure. I know the Department said there were five complaints. I am surprised there were only five, because I have had people tell me that they complained on multiple occasions. When I asked the Department about it when officials were before the committee, they said there were five individual complaints. I know that one person complained multiple times. It does not seem to have been captured. The plant itself appears to have been the focus, although some of the stuff on the television programme would have given major cause for concern about the behaviour of individuals within that plant. The public has access to the fields around it to look over the fence and see.</p>

I am not convinced that we are getting to the bottom of this at all. There is the traceability issue, as the Chair raised. The Department says it is putting something in place. We need a timeline on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_899"> Regarding Shannonside, my understanding was that it was the only plant of its type. The concern was that animals at the end of life may well have to be exported. We might ask the Department exactly what processes are in place for animals that are at the end of life.</p>

          <p eId="para_900">I think the answer is that conventional slaughterhouses and other facilities for slaughtering animals were being used where a horse had to be put down. One of those facilities was engaged in doing that on a temporary basis. We can ask for an update on that.</p>

          <p eId="para_902">The reason I raise the traceability issue is that my understanding is that all horses in the State are microchipped, or are supposed to be. Many of these are coming from within the horseracing sector, so one would think they would be microchipped. The Department needs to say why they are not. If one is putting in place a microchip system, it is a bit like having car tax without having a car tax registration system. Why would you have it? What is the use of it? I would like answers, setting out why it is not in place and what progress is being made to put one in place, to be put in correspondence.</p>

          <p eId="para_905">I am inclined to figure out what has happened here. Surely the microchip and passport system would say who the owner is and give their address. It is not as if it is 20 horses. It is 20,000 that have gone and my understanding is that we do not know where. It does not appear there is database. What progress has been made on putting one in place? Why is there not a database in place? When is a full database for the registration of horses expected? The Department needs to answer this. I know that with cattle it is really strict.</p>

          <p eId="para_909">No. R2832 was received from the Office of the Chairman of the OPW and is dated 30 September. It is a response to the committee's invitation for a meeting on 28 October 2024. I want to briefly mention that at last week's meeting, it was agreed in private session to schedule a meeting with the OPW on 8 October. The OPW has come back in the meantime and has said the date is not suitable as it has other engagements, etc., and is proposing the alternative date of Tuesday, 22 October. I propose to note and publish the correspondence. Is that agreed?</p>

          <p eId="para_915">The Deputy might recall the previous correspondence where the OPW said it had engagements and multi-stakeholder meetings and could not extrapolate itself from these too easily. Hopefully, we will still be here. It is on 22 October and it is agreed. That concludes consideration of correspondence for today.</p>
          <p eId="para_916"> We will move on to the work programme. A draft work programme discussion document has been circulated to members. It is displayed on the screen. Next week we will engage with the Land Development Agency in relation to the 2023 financial statements. On 17 October, we will engage with the Charities Regulator regarding the 2023 financial statements. Last week it was agreed to also schedule a meeting with the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities on this date but the CRU has indicated that key personnel are not available on that date. Do members wish to schedule a meeting with the CRU on another date?</p>

          <p eId="para_918">We will endeavour to do that. Bear in mind that on Tuesday, 22 October, it looks like we will have that meeting with the OPW. On Thursday, 24 October, the same week, we will engage with the Health Service Executive regarding the 2023 financial statements. Specific areas of interest flagged for this meeting will include the roll-out of an integrated financial management system, non-compliant procurement, staffing and remuneration and capacity of University of Limerick Hospitals Group. We agreed previously, and it came up again at a recent meeting, not to have too wide of an agenda with the HSE and that we would try to keep a focus on those issues. Last week it was agreed to schedule a meeting on 7 November with Children’s Health Ireland and the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board. I do not know if we have any indication as to whether we have been successful or not in scheduling that. There is nothing back on that yet but we will keep members apprised of this as I know they are anxious about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_919"> Members will be aware that the C and AG published his report on the accounts of the public services on Monday of this week. The report contains 24 chapters, highlighting issues for further consideration by this committee. It is proposed that we include chapter 4 on adapting flood risk management to climate change impacts and chapter 5 on delivery of rapid build housing on the agenda for our upcoming meeting with the OPW in light of that report, is that agreed?</p>

          <p eId="para_923">We have five free meeting slots in November and December and, taking into account the C and AG’s annual report and areas of interest to members, I ask them to consider which bodies to prioritise for these slots, for example, the Department of Finance, the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform, the Department of Social Protection or the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.</p>

          <p eId="para_927">I will make two suggestions on that. There are five free meeting slots available in November and December. I am taking the Taoiseach at his word. He says there will be no election until after St. Patrick's Day. We have to make provision for November and December. I suggest that if members are agreeable, we include the Department of Education. Issues have arisen, particularly in the C and AG's report, relating to protecting the State's investment in schools - in other words, the capital investment taxpayers are putting in. There are a number of other issues.</p>

          <p eId="para_929">With the prefab accommodation, the modular developments need to be included in that. The modular units being used sound like a good idea but if I am correct, I recently saw the cost of one escalating by approximately 300%. I am not sure of the detail. I will bring in Deputy Verona Murphy in one minute. She is online.</p>
          <p eId="para_930"> I wish to include education and deal with the issue of the State's investment in capital infrastructure, as well as protecting that in terms of the position of the patron and the State. I suggest that at some point in the future, we also look at including transport, in particular the rail projects. It is bonkers what is going on there.</p>

Regarding the Department of Education, if we are looking to discuss school transport, which I absolutely am, can we have a representative from the Department of Transport, so that we can have proper engagement on this?

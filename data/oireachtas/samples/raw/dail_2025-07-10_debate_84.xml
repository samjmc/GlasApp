          <from> An Cathaoirleach<recordedTime time="2025-07-10T10:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_13">I remind all of those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are on silent or switched off. Before we proceed, I have a few housekeeping matters. I remind members of the constitutional requirements that to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex. Members of the committee attending remotely must do so from within the precincts of Leinster House. Members are also reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 226 that the committee shall refrain from enquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies. Members are further reminded of the long-standing practice and ruling of the Cathaoirleach to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way to make him or her identifiable.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> The Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, is a permanent witness to the committee. We will now examine accounts and statements, correspondence and the work programme. We will then suspend the meeting and resume at 10.30 a.m. for an engagement with officials from the Department of Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation and the NSSO. Six sets of accounts and financial statements, which were laid between 30 June and 4 July 2025, are due to be considered today. I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to address them before opening the floor to members.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_2">
          <from> Mr. Seamus McCarthy<recordedTime time="2025-07-10T10:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_15">We have the financial statements of the University of Galway for the accounting period 2023-24. They received a clear audit opinion. The financial statements of Uisce Éireann for the calendar year 2024 received a clear audit opinion. The Marine Casualty Investigation Board 2024 financial statements received a clear audit opinion. The Corporate Enforcement Authority financial statements for 2024 received a clear audit opinion. The National Treatment Purchase Fund board financial statements for 2024 received a qualified audit opinion. In my view, the accounts give a true and fair view except that they account for the cost of retirement benefit entitlements only as they become payable, but that is a standard accounting presentation for the health bodies. The Child and Family Agency, also known as Tusla, financial statements for 2024 received a clear audit opinion. However, I drew attention to two matters. First, there were compensation and legal costs incurred by Tusla and the State Claims Agency in respect of four cases taken against Tusla. The compensation payments to the four individuals totalled €799,000. Plaintiff costs of €949,000 were paid in respect of two cases, with plaintiff costs in two cases yet to be determined. Tusla's own costs incurred to date are €1.6 million. The State Claims Agency's costs in these matters are not yet known. The second matter I drew attention to is a material level of procurement non-compliance, which was of the order of €5.4 million.</p>

          <from>Deputy James Geoghegan<recordedTime time="2025-07-10T10:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_16">In respect of the National Treatment Purchase Fund, we dealt with this issue when CHI was before us. The position of the National Treatment Purchase Fund with regard to how its moneys have been used is that it relied on the governance controls in every hospital that received those moneys. In Mr. McCarthy's opinion, all things being equal, should the National Treatment Purchase Fund have done more to probe where its moneys were being spent?</p>
          <p eId="para_17">In very simple terms, the allegations seem clear in the hospitals that are under investigation that, essentially, moneys were given to those hospitals and they were not used in accordance with the way they were supposed to be used and how they have drawn down those moneys. What is the obligation on the National Treatment Purchase Fund, even from its board's perspective, to ensure that the moneys that go into those hospitals are spent in accordance with the way in which they have been given those moneys?</p>

          <from> Mr. Seamus McCarthy<recordedTime time="2025-07-10T10:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_18">They certainly have addressed the issue in the light of information that has come into the public domain. It was a matter that came up towards the end of the audit and we did discuss it with them. They are, I think, in the process of reviewing what they need to do. I think there is scope for them to do more, but it is an open matter at this stage. I do not want to be definitive about this. We will perhaps make recommendations to them about actions they could consider at least. The 2024 financial statements were presented, I think, just the night before they appeared here, so it is obviously open to the committee to bring them back and to discuss further with them, maybe in the autumn, what action they are taking to tighten up and to be able to provide the committee with better assurance.</p>

          <p eId="para_19">I will follow on from that suggestion. I think they should come back before us if we can fit them in.</p>
          <p eId="para_20"> To go back to the University of Galway, there is a clear audit. As someone from Galway, I welcome that, and the university is very important. I have not had a chance to look at the documentation, but as regards the foundation, we discussed this the last time I was on the committee. That foundation is still in existence.</p>

          <p eId="para_26">As regards Tusla, we have confirmed that will be on our clár oibre because there are serious issues there and it is a very important agency. I will not go into them now. They are outlined here and we will have the agency before us.</p>

          <from> An Cathaoirleach<recordedTime time="2025-07-10T10:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_27">It has been agreed that we will add Tusla to our work programme. To get some clarity from the C and AG before I call Deputy McAuliffe, who I think wants to come in on this, these are extraordinary levels of expenditure in terms of legal costs, and it appears that that is not the definitive cost at this point. Do we know how this has come to light? Was it a protected disclosure or a whistleblower? Obviously, you cannot get into detail, but-----</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_13">
          <from> Mr. Seamus McCarthy<recordedTime time="2025-07-10T10:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_28">I think it is really for Tusla itself to provide explanations to the committee, but what is explained in the governance statement is that there were matters and I think I have pointed out that there was a subsequent whistleblower disclosure on the same set of events and both processes were ongoing. An investigation was done into the matters that were brought forward in the protected disclosure and a report was produced at, I think, a cost of €416,000, but that ended up being quashed after legal proceedings against the report. It is a very significant expense.</p>

          <p eId="para_30">We identified these issues in the course of the audit and sought further explanations. I felt it was appropriate to see that there was a disclosure and for me to draw attention to it.</p>

          <p eId="para_31">Were you looking to come in, Deputy McAuliffe? Anyone else? No? We will move on. Can we agree to note the listing of accounts and financial statements? Is that agreed? Agreed. The listing of accounts and financial statements will be published as part of our minutes.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> The following B items of correspondence were considered. No. R0153 is correspondence from the Department of Education and Youth. I think Deputy McAuliffe raised this in private session and I think it was tied in with correspondence No. R0155, which is from the City of Dublin ETB and relates to Whitehall College.</p>

          <p eId="para_33">This is an issue which the previous public accounts committee dealt with. It relates to Whitehall College, a building which has lain idle and unused for almost a decade. City of Dublin ETB has provided detailed correspondence with regard to the current position. Unfortunately, while the Department's reply is incredibly helpful in terms of the new project that will take place on the adjoining lands, it has not responded to the issues with regard to Whitehall College and the legal issues there. I ask that we go back to the Department and ask it to provide the details relating to the current case, the utilisation of the building and the costs which have been incurred.</p>

          <p eId="para_50">This morning, we will engage with the Department of Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation to discuss its report on the accounts of the public services 2023.</p>
          <p eId="para_51"> We welcome the following officials from the Department of Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation: Mr. David Moloney, Secretary General; Ms Niamh Duff, principal officer, corporate division; Mr. John Pender, principal officer, work and pensions division; Mr. David O’Sullivan, assistant secretary, Office of Government Procurement; and Ms Kate Ivory, principal officer, infrastructure division.</p>
          <p eId="para_52"> We welcome the following officials from the National Shared Services Office: Ms Bernie Kelly, NSSO CEO; and Mr. Seán Reilly, NSSO head of corporate services.</p>
          <p eId="para_53"> Finally, we are joined by officials from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General including: the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, who is a permanent witness to the committee, and Ms Irena Grzebieniak, deputy director of audit. The witnesses are all very welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_54"> I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence. The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege. This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting. However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure this privilege is not abused. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory with regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with such direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_55"> Witnesses are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue your remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_56"> I ask Mr. Seamus McCarthy to make his opening remarks.</p>

          <from> Mr. Seamus McCarthy<recordedTime time="2025-07-10T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_57">Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh. As members of the committee are aware, the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation is the Accounting Officer for a number of Votes, reflecting the responsibility of his Department for the development and administration of a number of discrete cross-departmental functions in specialised and technical areas. I issued clear audit opinions in relation to each of the four appropriation accounts for 2023 on this morning’s agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_58"> The 2023 appropriation account for Vote 11 - Office of the Minister for Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform records gross expenditure of just over €50 million under a single expenditure programme. Departmental staff pay accounted for €29.9 million. Grants to support the Department’s aegis bodies accounted for just over €11.7 million. At the end of 2023, the Department had a surplus of €4.6 million for surrender.</p>
          <p eId="para_59"> Vote 12 - Superannuation and Retired Allowances, is used to pay pensions to retired civil and public servants across a wide range of departments, offices and agencies. The gross spend on Vote 12 in 2023 amounted to €814 million. Appropriations-in-aid, mainly comprising employee pension contributions, amounted to €618 million. Receipts of employee contributions in respect of the post-2012 single public service pension scheme were €112 million, or 28%, higher than estimated. This is the main reason that the net outturn on the Vote for 2023 was a surplus of €111 million for surrender.</p>
          <p eId="para_60">While I issued a clear audit opinion on the account for Vote 12, I drew attention to a matter disclosed by the Accounting Officer that related to controls over payment of chargeable excess income tax, CET, liabilities to the Revenue Commissioners. CET liability arises at the point of retirement for those retiring on high-value pensions. There is statutory provision for the tax liability to be paid on behalf of the pensioner by the pensions administrator with the recovery of the related debt over 20 years through reduced payment. Pension administration is carried out on behalf of the Vote by the NSSO. Of 21 cases where a CET liability had been identified between 2015 and 2023, the reductions in pension payments had been duly paid in each case, but the tax due had been paid to Revenue in only six cases. The tax due in respect of the other 15 cases amounting to €2.3 million had not been paid. A correcting payment, including a related interest charge, was made to Revenue in 2024, and this will appear as a charge on the 2024 appropriation account.</p>
          <p eId="para_61"> The Office of Government Procurement, OGP, carries out specialised functions in relation to the procurement of goods and services by public bodies. This includes the putting in place of framework agreements that public bodies can use to procure required goods and services. The 2023 appropriation account for Vote 39 Office of Government Procurement records gross expenditure of €18.8 million. The surplus remaining unspent at the end of 2023 amounted to €3.4 million. </p>
          <p eId="para_62"> The Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, OGCIO, provides an ICT shared service to a number of Departments and offices. This includes video and data services, email and productivity applications across the public service, and cybersecurity. The 2023 appropriation account for Vote 43 records gross expenditure of €44.5 million. The net surplus on the Vote at the end of the year was €953,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_63"> Arising from its responsibility in relation to central control and oversight of public spending, the Department sets the standard accounting policies for all appropriation accounts, and issues binding directions around public financial management and procedures and the corporate governance of public bodies. The Department is leading a project to move central government accounting from the current modified cash basis to a more standard accrual basis. This includes the development of a new framework of central government accounting standards, a number of which came into force in January 2024. These will impact the 2024 appropriation accounts, which I will publish in September.</p>
          <p eId="para_64"> Chapter 3 - Vote accounting and budget management is a recurrent annual report which aggregates and summarises the results across all appropriation accounts as a permanent record. It also highlights any exceptional matters that potentially concern vote management and vote accounting generally. In that regard, the chapter in respect of vote accounting in 2023 explains the accounting treatment of certain advances of funds to the Office of Public Works for the development of Terminal 7 at Rosslare Europort. The works at Terminal 7 commenced in 2023 and I understand are expected to be completed later this year. The overall approved budget is €236 million. The project is being managed by the OPW on an agency basis on behalf of the main public bodies that operate in the port, which are the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of agriculture, An Garda Síochána and the Health Service Executive. Because of the agency arrangement, the costs of the project are being met <i>pro rata</i> by the user bodies. In 2023, amounts totalling €132.7 million were advanced from Votes 9, 20 and 30 to the OPW to meet the costs of development as they arose. By the end of December 2023, the OPW had disbursed €51 million to the contractors. The remaining €81.7 million was recorded by the OPW as credit balances in favour of the three Votes. The Department’s public financial procedures indicate that only the amounts certified by the OPW as disbursed fell to be treated as charges in the 2023 appropriation accounts. However, exercising his statutory powers, the Minister for public expenditure determined that the total amounts advanced to the OPW in 2023 were appropriate for charging in the 2023 accounts. I am required by law to report on the correctness of the payments recorded in the appropriation accounts. I am satisfied that the statutory determination of the Minister made the charges in 2023 correct. However, to facilitate parliamentary accountability, audited financial statements need to be reliable, consistent and clearly understood by users. Given the departure from the public financial procedures principles and from the standard accounting policies for appropriation accounts in respect of the charges totalling €81.7 million, I considered it necessary and appropriate to draw this matter to the attention of Dáil Éireann.</p>

          <p eId="para_65">I thank Mr. McCarthy. We will now move to the opening statements of our other witnesses as set out in the letter of invitation. They have five minutes to make their opening remarks. I ask Mr. David Moloney to make the opening statement on behalf of the Department of Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation.</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_31">
          <from> Mr. David Moloney<recordedTime time="2025-07-10T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_66">I thank the Cathaoirleach and the members of the committee for the opportunity to attend to discuss the appropriation accounts for 2023. Much of what I have in my opening remarks has been covered by the Comptroller and Auditor General so I will endeavour to summarise it quickly. I am here to discuss Vote 11 - Office of the Minister for Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation; Vote 12 - Superannuation and Retired Allowances; Vote 39 - Office of Government Procurement; Vote 43 - Office of the Government Chief Information Officer; and Chapter 3 of the Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2023.</p>
          <p eId="para_67"> In each of these instances the mission of my Department is to drive the delivery of better public services, living standards and infrastructure for the people of Ireland. To support this, we undertake a range of actions under our three strategic goals of enhancing governance, building capacity and delivering effectively. In 2023, the surplus to surrender of €4.6 million was partly due to savings on payroll of €2.7 million and a saving of €2.2 million related to the management of EU programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_68"> During 2023, the Department implemented a divisional reorganisation following a strategic review of its operating model in 2022. This means the Department now works in a more integrated and joined-up way. Where there were previously two separate programmes, there is now a single, unified programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_69"> In respect of Vote 12 - Superannuation and Retired Allowances, the net outturn for 2023 was €195.9 million, compared to an Estimate of €306.7 million, giving a surplus of €110.8 million. The surplus primarily arose due to greater than anticipated contributions received from the single public service pension scheme, as well as underspend on established Civil Service pensioner lump sums.</p>
          <p eId="para_70"> I am the Accounting Officer for Vote 12. As provided for under the public financial procedures and in accordance with the relevant legislation, I discharge my obligations by preparing to the best of my ability an accurate appropriation account, ensuring lawful and efficient use of funds, maintaining internal controls, co-operating with auditors and being accountable to oversight bodies. In relation to shared services, I rely on a letter of assurance from the NSSO.</p>
          <p eId="para_71"> During the course of the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit of the Vote 12 appropriation account for 2023, and as set out in the statement of internal financial control, weaknesses were identified in the internal control environment within the NSSO and within the Vote 12 oversight processes. The issue related to the payment of chargeable excess taxes to the Revenue Commissioners by the NSSO. A review of the Department’s internal controls was concluded and we made changes to our oversight arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_72"> In relation to the OGP, over the past decade public procurement has grown to become a much larger part of public spending, now accounting for an estimated €18.5 billion of public money awarded through procurement competitions each year. Public procurement has also taken on a much more strategic role. It is now a key tool for delivering broader economic and policy goals, such as managing inflationary pressures, supporting SMEs, advancing green and social initiatives or driving innovation and new technologies. In relation to the OGP’s financial performance in 2023, the appropriation account shows a net outturn of €18.25 million, giving a surplus to surrender of €3.4 million. The surrender was driven in the main by savings on pay costs and some delays in commencing two projects that aim to digitalise existing procurement processes.</p>
          <p eId="para_73"> In relation to Vote 43, the OGCIO Vote supports the Department’s vision for a single, shared ICT platform across the Government and drives the digital government agenda. It leads on digital service delivery and innovation, oversees ICT initiatives across Departments, and represents Ireland at EU level on public service ICT and egovernment. </p>
          <p eId="para_74">A Supplementary Estimate of €4.9 million was approved in November 2023 via the Brexit adjustment reserve fund and this funding was used to extend the national low latency platform, NLLP, to the ports of Dublin, Rosslare and Cork.</p>
          <p eId="para_75"> In regard to chapter 3, in terms of overall performance, gross voted expenditure in 2023 was €94.9 billion when spending on the Social Insurance Fund and National Training Fund are included. Spending in 2023 supported investment in the public sector workforce; improvements in public services for a growing and changing population; investment in digitalisation and climate initiatives; and enhancing infrastructure. Spending in 2023 also reflected measures to address external developments, such as cost-of-living packages, aid for those affected by the Ukraine war, and supporting public services with the legacy impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
          <p eId="para_76"> Thank you for the invitation, a Chathaoirligh. We are happy to take any questions the committee may have.</p>

          <p eId="para_78">I welcome the witnesses and the officials from the Department. It is a very important Department. I do not envy them their job. In comparison, our job is a little easier. They are required to deliver better public services, living standards and infrastructure for the people of Ireland. I cannot think of a more important job. They are also responsible for governance, so there is a particular onus on them.</p>
          <p eId="para_79"> I am going to look at Votes 11 and 12. I will ask a few general questions. I do not wish to appear curt but I just want to get answers as best I can. That is all. I respect the work the witnesses do, but there is a particular onus on them in regard to governance and responsibility and their own Department showing example to all the other Departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_80"> I want to very quickly deal with something that arose today. We have already agreed that we will respond to this correspondence. It relates to the submission of annual reports. A letter from the Department of Transport points something out, although it does not really matter to the presentation of annual reports. Guidance was issued on 30 May by the Department of An Taoiseach on the management of these financial reports. Is Mr. Moloney aware of that? The consequences from our point of view is that those financial reports will not appear before us for scrutiny until the autumn because it appears they have to go to the Cabinet first. First, is Mr. Moloney aware of the guidance that was issued on 30 May? Second, will he explain how some annual reports go before the Cabinet and others do not? To us, it appears to be random. Will he answer those questions, please?</p>

          <p eId="para_88">Perhaps Mr. Moloney could read it and come back to us on it. The consequence for us is that financial reports will not appear here for our scrutiny until later when the Comptroller and Auditor General has signed off on the reports. Now, there will be a delay. In the case of the Department of Transport, those reports will not be brought before the Cabinet until after the summer recess. That is uimhir a haon.</p>

Everything was calculated correctly but the final step had not been taken. The Revenue audit of sample cases highlighted that six out of 11 cases had not correctly calculated the chargeable excess tax. </p>

There are several cases out for query at present. To give context, the calculation of CET also includes any private pension, AVC and so on that someone joining the Civil Service has. There is other information that needs to be collected in order to do the calculation.

          <p eId="para_191">If I may come back to Mr. Moloney, the corrective measures in July 2024 that he was confident in were put in place. How has there been a downfall in them, given another 20 to 30 cases have arisen since then?</p>

          <p eId="para_192">The issue in 2023 was that the money was not paid over to Revenue but the money was calculated. The issue currently is that CET was not calculated in regard to these cases because it was not understood they were subject to CET or that the standard fund threshold was reached. I understand that happened for a number of reasons. As Ms Kelly said, one of the factors was that some people may have private pensions. Another possible issue might be that the standard fund threshold, when it was established, was seen to apply only to the most senior grades in the public service but, in fact, it is a value threshold and is not related to grade. That may have caused some confusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_193"> One of the things the Minister has asked for, and the chair of the NSSO is in the process of commissioning, is a full end-to-end review in order that we fully understand these issues. At the moment, we are giving the best information we can based on the work done in recent months in catching up on the issues. We will procure a full audit of the issues and, at that stage, we will have a much clearer view of the full range of causes. For the moment, the factors I mentioned are what we see as the most likely source. Using an external auditor, we will validate that.</p>

          <p eId="para_194">Going back to the original 21 cases, where six payments were made to Revenue and 15 were not, Mr. Moloney's explanation for that at the beginning of the discussion was there was a significant error. Was it an IT error, a human error or just arising from a lack of understanding of the obligations?</p>

          <p eId="para_196">I was coming to that. For the NSSO to collect just over €2.3 million in tax for a period of nine years and not hand it over to Revenue is quite a significant oversight. I am sure Mr. Moloney will admit it is not minor in any way, shape or form.</p>

          <p eId="para_197">To clarify, and the Accounting Officer may be able to give a view on this as well, the deductions were not resulting in cash pile-up. What was happening was the pensions payable to the individuals were reduced in quantum. There was not a deduction from what they were paid; it was just never paid to them. Therefore, cash was not building up in a suspense account that would have triggered an earlier realisation there was a problem. It is actually a very complicated calculation and I can see how the errors would have occurred. The important thing is to have systems that trigger an early detection and an early resolution.</p>

          <p eId="para_199"> A broad range of groups have been affected by the pensions issue. The Minister, Deputy Chambers, has been very clear that he is initiating a scoping exercise to identify the number of retired civil and public servants whose pensions will need to be checked. The figure that was quoted is a maximum of 13,000 people but it may not reach that. Has Mr. Moloney any idea what the number is at the moment? Is it foreseen to reach 13,000?</p>

When we initially addressed the issue publicly, the number was 13,000 people's pensions potentially needing to be checked to see whether they were affected by the issue that affects work sharers.

Within the overall figure, education is a key focus, alongside health and other social issues. The previous Government, in its last budget, and this Government, in the programme for Government, have put a priority on delivering certain things, including, in particular, the water grid upgrades and transport services needed to deliver housing. That does not mean other areas are not in receipt of very significant moneys under the NDP and will not be in receipt of very significant moneys under the revised NDP. In fact, education is an area where the capital spent has increased hugely over the past ten years.</p>

Prior to the C and AG's findings we did that on an annual basis and subsequently what we did was that we went through the whole process and identified what information we needed from the NSSO.

          <p eId="para_254">I thank the witnesses. I will pick up where we finished there. In Mr. Moloney's opening statement, he was very clear, and Ms Duff just clarified that point. Mr. Moloney pointedly said, "... in relation to shared services I rely on a letter of assurance [from the accounting officer] from the National Shared Services Office." Was he trying to draw some kind of distinction between his governance responsibilities as it relates to the NSSO versus all of his other governance responsibilities or what was his purpose or motivation in clarifying that point?</p>

          <p eId="para_255">No, I am the Accounting Officer for Vote 12, so the integrity of that reporting is my responsibility. I was simply making the point that in large parts of my responsibilities, where they are delivered by third parties, public financial procedures and-or legislative frameworks can exist where I am entitled to rely on certain statements of assurance I have been given. It is no more than that. In regard to the issues that have arisen, we see ourselves as having a very active role in identifying what the issues are and helping to fix them within our own processes and within processes elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">We envisage the NSSO and the HR and finance units of line Departments having a significant role. We believe the end-to-end issues will be addressed in the context of the review the Minister has asked the chairman to commission.</p>

          <p eId="para_257">From a governance standpoint, the separate issues of the Revenue Commissioners underpayment and the pension overpayment are both important, perhaps one more than the other. The buck stops with Mr. Moloney as Secretary General of the Department. Was he trying to muddy the waters by stating he relies on an assurance statement from the CEO of the NSSO? Was he trying to draw any kind of distinction in that regard?</p>

Any businesses watching will be aware that the impact on businesses that do not pay the Revenue Commissioners is unbelievably serious. What is the impact when an issue emerges? I take the Comptroller and Auditor General's point on the complexity involved in the particular type of tax that was not paid to the Revenue Commissioners, but what actions do the Revenue Commissioners take against either the NSSO or the Department when underpaid?</p>

          <p eId="para_278">Therefore, this was a unique scenario.</p>
          <p eId="para_279"> To move on to another issue, we had the former CEO of Children's Health Ireland before this committee last week and she made clear that, in relation to her former position as CEO, she had been automatically given a contract of indefinite duration because of two five-year, fixed-term, consecutive contracts. The outworking of her asserting that legal right through a mediation process with the hospital, and, as I understand it, the Department of Health, was that the Department of Health had to write to the Department of public expenditure and reform seeking sanction for her to remain in a new role at precisely the same salary she would have had if she had remained on as CEO. How problematic is it that a Minister who is determined, against the wishes of the board, not to reappoint a CEO is essentially stymied? A new CEO can be appointed but the taxpayer has to ensure that whoever is taken out of the position has to stay on. Is this unique to CHI or does Mr. Moloney believe there are wider issues? There are over 900 non-commercial State entities, according to the CSO report in 2023. Could this affect hundreds of CEOs? What is his view on that?</p>

          <p eId="para_280">I do not believe so, but the issue does arise from time to time. The legislation is such that contracts of indefinite duration can and do arise. As I indicated in reply to Deputy Connolly, the management of that in more recent years has been much more active across the public service. There is much greater awareness of what triggers a contract of indefinite duration. As an employer, you have a legal responsibility you have to meet, and that is not avoidable. I do not wish to comment on any individual HR case or person. In many cases, there might be a negotiation of some kind or a suitable alternative role might be found, but it certainly is a restriction.</p>

          <p eId="para_282">The management of that is a matter for individual Departments and individual Accounting Officers. With regard to the engagement people have around sanctioning requests, there is a very clear view in my Department that contracts of indefinite duration should be avoided. That is a conversation that often happens in relation to CEO renewals or applications for CEO renewals. Where somebody was seeking sanction from my Department to reappoint an existing CEO, we would ask a number of questions about it. One of those questions would be on the potential to create a contract of indefinite duration.</p>

          <p eId="para_283">I have a final question on another issue. How concerned is Mr. Moloney that the moneys his Department awarded to the Department of Health, that were then given to the NTPF and other waiting list initiatives and that were subsequently granted to hospitals for a specific purpose, were not in fact used for the purpose intended? How concerned is he, as we head into budget negotiations, about moneys his Department might allocate to the Department of Health that then go to the NTPF? Is his Department taking action on that?</p>

          <p eId="para_284">Clearly, serious issues have been signalled in relation to that. We are very concerned about those issues. We are aware that, in the first instance, the Department of Health is taking action regarding them. We will engage with interest on the review and oversight of what is happening and how extensive the practice is. However, as with all of these things, the first step has to be the establishment of the facts. Once we have established the facts, we will be better placed to recommend actions to the Government, including the Minister.</p>

What I am struggling to get my head around a little is that despite the policy of the Government and Department on not wanting to extend CEO contracts automatically, we hear there is legal entitlement to extend them. I am not talking about any individual but about the role of CEO.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">Are we relying on people to not avail of their right? Is that the reason this is not endemic? How many CEOs has Mr. Moloney received similar requests about in the past 12 months?</p>

          <p eId="para_290">These are individual HR issues. I can tell the Deputy the same conversation has been had in another situation. In the code of practice for State bodies we say there can be two five-year terms for CEOs. That is the policy position. We believe that reflects good governance practice, in that the person could be the head of an organisation for ten years and then we would provide fresh thinking and a change for all those good organisational reasons. That is what drives the policy position as set out in the code of practice. The legislation is as it is and under the legislation a contract of indefinite duration can be triggered under certain circumstances. The legislation also allows that situation to be managed in such a way that a contract of indefinite duration is not triggered. We fully respect the legislation and people's rights under it, but the legislation does provide a framework that can be managed in a way to avoid the creation of a contract of indefinite duration. Mostly, that implies just following the code, which specifies two five-year terms and completion.</p>

          <p eId="para_304"> I will not ask him about specifics with regard to the national development plan, but who is involved in the negotiation process? Does he share my concern that it is politically vulnerable in terms of cost effectiveness and the policy on public procurement? Is there a risk with the national development plan as it stands, and the negotiation process, given that we have seen people say on the public record that they have secured this, that and the other in the national development plan review? Mr. Moloney says we are still in negotiation. Is it politically vulnerable?</p>

          <p eId="para_305">To answer the first part of the question, initially, it is engagement between my Department and other Departments. We have teams that look after each area of expenditure and they engage with line Departments. Ministers put in their bids and set out their priorities and asks. It is a public policy process and choice. Fundamentally, it is the priorities within the NDP, and the relative importance of priorities within it is not a technical matter, it embodies a range of policy choices which in the final instance will be made by the Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_307">Negotiations are what they are. No money can be spent without a business case or the appropriate procurement and value-for-money rules being followed. The Minister puts a suggestion before the Government about the allocations, which is what will happen in the next couple of weeks, and then Ministers are responsible within their own areas to decide priorities. Once they present projects, all of the governance in terms of value for money and public procurement kicks in then. A Minister is not able to spend the money without undergoing those processes.</p>

The Minister reported in April that a task force was being set up to tackle the slow pace of infrastructural provision and that expertise from Uisce Éireann, EirGrid and the ESB would come to the table, meet on a monthly basis and report in July. Could he provide an update on the status of the task force? Has it met, how often and has the report been made yet?</p>

A couple of things have happened: in addition to the organisations mentioned by Deputy Farrelly, we have An Coimisiún Pleanála and secondees have been allocated to the Department from all those organisations to form part of an infrastructure team which is looking in particular at barriers. The first phase of the report at the end of July will be about barriers to infrastructure and identifying what the key barriers are with a view to seeking to remove them.</p>
          <p eId="para_310"> The accelerating infrastructure task force, chaired by the Minister, has met but I do not have the exact number of meetings. I can provide that information to the Deputy. I would say it has met four times but I will confirm that.</p>

We have put a programme of communication under way since the issue was raised. We spoke to colleagues in the Retired Civil and Public Servants Association, RCPSA, a few weeks ago about the issue, to clarify it. The association has since put two statements on its website stating that no action is required by anybody on their behalf, and that we will reach out and communicate.

From a procurement point of view, data is important to the State for building confidence in decisions of Government and also for resourcing organisations.

          <p eId="para_329">In a wider context with that €18 billion figure, I received an answer from the Department of Health to a parliamentary question regarding the HSE's public procurement. What we found was shocking. Between 2020 and 2024, public procurement in the HSE has gone from more than €1 billion to more than €4 billion. Are there any checks and balances on that or how does the Department feel about this public expenditure and the significant increase? I saw it reported last Sunday in the <i>Business Post </i>that the rate of increase in spending this year was something like 91% and we are only halfway through the year. I want to see how the Department of public expenditure is managing the HSE's ballooning public procurement spend. Do we have any accountability as to where that goes? </p>

          <p eId="para_330">The public procurement in the budget in the Department of Health have increased very significantly in recent years. The public procurement would include the procurement of drugs of all kinds - ordinary drugs, high-tech drugs, etc. - as well as cleaning services. It is a figure that reflects a huge range of different types of activities. We manage the overall budget. In the Department of Health and the HSE there are roles such as the Accounting Officer and the accountable person to manage the specifics of their budgets. The Department of Health is one of the central purchasing bodies under our procurement arrangements. We would expect the public procurements to be managed in a way that focuses on value for money. </p>

          <p eId="para_331">When spending is rising at such a rapid rate, it is vital that there is value for money incorporated into it. The health budget seems to be ever increasing and ever expanding and will only ever contract when the economy contracts, as opposed to better management currently. The Department needs to ensure that spending is reined in and managed effectively. Why is it the case that the HSE only has to publish purchase orders worth more than €50,000, as opposed to every other public entity, where orders worth more than €20,000 have to be published? </p>

          <p eId="para_343">It is important to bear in mind that when we speak of being compliant that a competition might be advertised today and might not be concluded for a number of months or even years. It is very difficult to say that a body is not compliant with something. Certainly the OGP has a responsibility to look at the tendering data and is working towards that. </p>

          <p eId="para_353">It is ironic that it will pay a penalty but will get it back in the other hand. There is no real punishment or no real cost. The National Gallery, another State entity which was before us, had a nightmare and will have to find the money to figure things out whereas in this case it is: "There is going to be a penalty but, what about it, we will get it back". I do not like that, but what can we do?</p>
          <p eId="para_354"> In the time remaining, I will talk about the national development plan. Why has there been persistent underspending on some capital projects across the NDP?

          <p eId="para_355">The national development plan for 2021 represented a huge increase in ambition and funding. In the early years of that increase in funding, Departments did struggle to get projects up and running, and did struggle to start spending that, so we had very significant underspends in capital in those early years. Departments are now up and running. They are now spending their capital. It is now really just about putting the systems and processes in place for the higher level of investment within the NDP.

          <p eId="para_358">I thank the witnesses for coming in to answer our questions today. We all know, anecdotally, that there are lots of schoolchildren looking for school places, particularly children with autism. The NCSE has stated that it is a capacity issue. That is one of the reasons we are not seeing new classes and new schools opening, and prefabs being dropped at schools. How many schools have been stalled or re-profiled due to fiscal constraints or the perception that there is a value-for-money issue?</p>

          <p eId="para_359">I do not have that information to hand. I am not aware of particular projects. I would not have sight of that. Obviously the actual amount of money allocated to education in capital has increased very rapidly over recent years, albeit from a relatively low base. We see a large number of schools having been completed and made up but we can look at that detail and provide a note.</p>

          <p eId="para_362">I thank Mr. Moloney. Some of my colleague have touched on the mechanisms in place to monitor and respond to cost escalations and delays generally. We have MetroLink and the children's hospital. What infrastructure does the Department have in place to intervene when we see a huge ballooning of costs for capital projects?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_301">
          <from> Mr. David Moloney<recordedTime time="2025-07-10T12:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_363">There are a couple of things in that. I thank the Deputy for her question. On an ongoing basis we monitor the spend across government. Where we see issues, we can get involved. For example, in relation to the national children's hospital, we were involved at quite an early stage in the escalation of costs in that over the years. We do that as part of our overall Vote monitoring, on an ongoing basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_364"> The other piece around that is that one of the things we want the accelerating infrastructure task force reports to do is to identify how we can unblock some of the things that causes delays. Costs are an issue for any project. Obviously for the children's hospital there were elements of insufficient design at an early stage and other things.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">However, as we know, for many projects, there are also planning, regulatory and consent process delays so we are looking at that. We are looking to remove any roadblocks we can with a view to taking away the causes of those escalating costs.</p>

          <p eId="para_366">Obviously, we have the children's hospital huge cost escalation. How often on average would the Department of Health go back to Mr. Moloney's Department looking for extra funding? How many times a year would it happen? Obviously, the cost increases are incremental. I do not like to use the phrase "cap in hand", but how often is the ask put to Mr. Moloney's Department to fund the children's hospital, per year?</p>

          <p eId="para_367">Most projects, and particularly projects that are relatively standardised, come in on time and in budget. There are particular challenges around some very large major megaprojects and I suppose the children's hospital brought that very much to the forefront or very much to light.</p>
          <p eId="para_368"> In effect, over the last number of years the conversation around the children's hospital in part has been constant, so the allocation might not be changed more than once a year in relation to it. The timing of that is also influenced by commercial considerations because the allocation is partly the result of our commercial exchange with the contractors. That can happen according to a cycle that is really about the negotiation with the contractors but there is an ongoing discussion. We have monthly meetings with the Department of Health where we go through a range of issues. Those meetings would have visibility on issues like the children's hospital and its potential future costs.</p>

Obviously, we think of the National Shared Services Office and we think of the 4 million transactions it conducts each year instead of having a plethora of small salary sections trying to make payments to people. There are benefits to aggregation in that but there are also, less visibly, services that Departments provide to each other. So Revenue would provide services to people, given the extensive IT network and capacity that it has. That is maybe not as visible.</p>

          <p eId="para_376">Our performance framework is informed by value for money but it is also informed by impact on the lives of people. What we do there is we see things in terms of an equality-budgeting lens and gender budgeting then is part of our equality-budgeting lens so we report on that. I suppose we are still at the stage where our emphasis is to try to embed the impact on various lenses of equality as people examine policies and I suppose that is kind of hard to measure. It is hard to capture but it is part of the process thinking. It is part of the policy-making piece that well-being and equality would be taken into account in making policy choices and in spending money. Of course, we produce reports with these outputs and we are continuing to develop that. I suppose our next stage will probably be a kind of a tagging. I do not really have the kind of information the Deputy is looking for because we do not really tag things in that way just now but we are trying to move towards a stage where we tag things and we will have a greater visibility on how much money is being specifically directed at the various equality and well-being dimensions.</p>

The large sums of money that have been floating around really relate to chargeable excess tax, which is, of course, a large sum of money but is normally repaid over 20 years under the legislation, so the repayment plan in that case would be a repayment plan over the 20 years in accordance with the legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_384">It is important to allow the end-to-end review that is going to take place to answer that question. It is an important question. Where policy is made in our Department, there is certainly a question about how it is communicated, how it is understood and how it is applied. That relates to the NSSO and it relates to line Departments.

We are working by end year on a national digital and AI strategy. That is being led out by the Department of the Taoiseach. Obviously we are responsible for public administration side of that and the Department of enterprise is responsible for the business side of that. Whether that will lead to a uniform - because there are different products and there are issues of competition - approach and a uniform set or suite of software, we will have to see but we believe that the adoption of AI is really essential to future efficiency and future growth. It is about doing that in a way that safeguards appropriate and protects the trust of the citizen.</p>

I want to touch on an overriding theme that might help me in the future inform how I understand the running of the country and, indeed, how we spend our money. To clarify, the overview of the brief states that the Accounting Officer of the Minister for the Department has a number of key statutory responsibilities for public administration and spending, including the provision of formal sanction for public expenditure oversight and control of public spending, setting the general accounting policies for all appropriation accounts and issuing directions around public financial management and procedures and standards for corporate governance of public bodies. Is that correct?</p>

          <p eId="para_390">I want to clarify that that is correct because sometimes we have a number of different issues. I might use different examples of spending, so I get to understand how we use it.</p>
          <p eId="para_391"> I will use a local example. We are talking about the 2023 accounts. In 2023, the OPW failed to buy the lands at Castletown House. They were purchased by a third party. There was always a question of how much was spent. Who would ultimately sanction the amount spent by the OPW, if it had put in a bid at that time? What I am trying to get at is who is ultimately responsible for spending and for what can be spent, because sometimes one group will say the Department of public expenditure did not allow it, the OPW will turn around and agree it was the Department of public expenditure and then the Department of public expenditure will say it was the OPW? Who can sanction the amount? That is the question I am asking here.</p>

          <p eId="para_469">There would be on many appropriation accounts a small amount of overpayment of salary. It could arise because perhaps the payment instructions have gone out but then the person was not at work and was not entitled to be paid. There are figures in each of the appropriation accounts in respect of that amount, but it is quite small, generally.</p>

          <p eId="para_470">Okay, so it is less of an issue. In fairness, pensions are more complex, so I get it. I have one last little question relating to RTÉ. It is slightly from left field, but I know it was referred to as well. I think it was one of the last points. It is in areas where there is variance in funding that might have been seen. RTÉ would, obviously, has less money coming in. Fewer people have been paying their licence fees in recent years. Is this a concern for the Department or would you be leaving this issue with the Department of communications? Would the Department perhaps be advising that there be a different strategy taken towards having a different model of funding for RTÉ on an ongoing basis?</p>

          <p eId="para_471">That is a conversation that has been had. On the one hand, there is the sectoral decline in the number of households with televisions, so this is reducing the taxpayer base. On the other hand, there were issues impacting RTÉ that were perceived to have affected people's confidence and willingness to pay the TV licence. In our view, the licence is an important stream of income and we have been in conversation with the relevant Department in this regard. Our view, though, is that the licence fee continues to be an important stream of income.</p>

          <p eId="para_478">I want to discuss Vote 29 - IT and procurement overspends. Mr. Moloney will be aware that we had the Arts Council before us a few weeks ago. It had effectively wasted €6.7 million in taxpayers' money on a failed IT system. If the Department is involved in oversight, how could this have happened at its hand? How was this not sorted out before it ever came to us?</p>

          <p eId="para_479">The role in IT is very specific. It is set out in the relevant circular, which I can make available to the Deputy. Effectively, my Department approves new IT projects. The Arts Council IT project would have come to my Department, I think, in 2019 - I will have to check - and been approved as a viable IT project. At that point, the delivery of the project is a matter for the responsible Department. </p>

In all the years there was an issue regarding the Arts Council, was there no oversight by the Department to see where that €7 million went? At the time, going across all the Departments as well, the Residential Tenancies Board and RTÉ were also examples of IT projects. Is the vendor that was used for those specific IT projects still used in public procurement? Is public procurement under the Department's remit for all IT? </p>

          <p eId="para_489">There is narrow scope to exclude people under poor past prior performance. However, that has to be a material failure and has to have led to damages or the contract being terminated. That is largely through the courts and takes quite a long time. Potential suppliers and economic operators cannot be eliminated because of hearsay or because of a project failure. There are many reasons why projects fail; they are not all due to the economic operator or supplier. There could be poor organisation, delays through internal resources or delays through equipment. </p>
          <p eId="para_490"> In relation to this particular project, I do not have sight of that particular vendor but to remove them through that, they would need to have gone through the courts. It is also important to bear in mind the policy is to use the open competitive procedure, which attracts bids widely. Excluding people is a very serious undertaking. </p>

Who had oversight of all those projects? Who am I to blame or whose head should be on the chopping board for all those incidents? The Department is supposed to have oversight of everything. Maybe it is not the Department; I do not know. What is the difference? The Department of Finance gives the Department the money to have oversight and ensure this does not happen but as far as I can see, there is a lot of wastage of taxpayers' money. If it was my money, it would not be wasted and if it was Mr. Moloney's money, it would not be wasted but this is the taxpayers' money. I want to ensure their money is not being wasted.

Most small businesses would say it is often cheaper to buy their premises than to rent them. I have a big issue with how we procure housing under the HAP scheme. Some of the most vulnerable people in the country are essentially procuring on behalf of the State. They are doing so as individuals rather than us collectively procuring it. I do not think we would do that for any other form of public procurement. We are fragmenting our purchase rather than pulling it together and getting better value for money. That is how the HAP scheme works, however. The tenant in situ scheme offered good value for money. The State would gain a capital asset while reducing current expenditure. It has the additional benefit of providing security to the tenant. On the value of money element, why are we not putting more money into the tenant in situ scheme rather than less?</p>

          <p eId="para_572">To answer strictly on the value for money element, the tenant in situ scheme has two challenges from a value for money perspective. There is a significant estate management cost to social housing and a consequence of the tenant in situ scheme is that it leads to having a diverse range of units in very different places. The estate management piece of that needs to be taken into account in terms of its costs. The other aspect is the equity around access to social housing. The tenant in situ scheme is trigged by a landlord's decision to sell rather than an objective assessment of the need of the tenant. When we look at the tenant in situ scheme from a value for money perspective-----</p>

          <p eId="para_575">One could also counter the argument about estate management costs. There is a cost to concentrating low-income housing in one area and that is often an additional cost to the State. Mixed tenure or mixed income are far better principles to apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">I am surprised that the Department of public expenditure is not telling the Department of housing that the latter should be progressing the tenant in situ scheme. In fact, we should be trying to procure as many properties as possible because it reduces the State's expenditure and the State gains an asset. In other areas of public facilities, we would be actively looking for opportunities to purchase properties, but not in this area. I accept Mr. Moloney's Department is not responsible for housing policy. From a value-for-public money perspective, the continuation of HAP and the failure to seek or roll out opportunities offered by the tenant in situ scheme appear to be bad value for money and bad management of public money.</p>

They can sometimes be basic things. Some of the money is spent on temporary call centres, for which it would not make sense to hire permanent civil servants. Some of it was to support the digitisation of the public service and such sophisticated types of activity. Value for money should inform how we deliver our services and whether we use external consultants or deliver a project or service using civil servants. The preference has always been to use civil servants where possible. The reality is that, sometimes, the knowledge transfer and access to expertise does not allow that.</p>

          <p eId="para_629">I would appreciate it if Mr. Moloney could do so. Clause 4.1 in the agreement provides that it should be used as a framework for additional payments to be made to cover wages. In this particular case, it is NTPF and the HSE, but they are basically bouncing off each other. The staff are the victims here. They are not getting their pay increases. These are health professionals working in dementia units, long-term residential care, day services and so on. I think Mr. Moloney will agree that it is deeply unfair. I would appreciate it if he could take that issue up directly. It is a small cohort. It possibly involves fewer than ten organisations across the country. I acknowledge that many of the section 39 organisations are getting the pay agreements, but there are some that are not. It needs to be addressed because we are now several months after the agreement.</p>

It is incumbent upon the Department to set the standard and to make sure we are delivering better public services. It must continually look to reform from within and to reduce the red tape rather than add to it. That is a role that certainly needs to be far improved, particularly as our State grows.</p>

There needs to be much more hand holding by the Department in managing the legal fees. I looked at one set of accounts recently.

          <p eId="para_680"> I have worked in the procurement space. I always thought that public procurement was supposed to drive transparency, efficiency and competition and get value for money. However, we only have to look at the OPW issues. Anecdotally I have heard of a case recently on an OPW estate involving a new small kitchen. They could have walked down the road to any of the kitchen providers and it would have cost €20,000. The OPW came back and told them it was going to be €120,000. That is six times more. Instead of public procurement driving value, it is driving up the cost. </p>
          <p eId="para_681">We have to do better. How fit for purpose are the public procurement processes and frameworks, and the legal frameworks agreements? Are refunds and service credits being put in place? One of the witnesses we had before the committee told us they were not allowed include penalties for non-service delivery. That individual pointed to Mr. O'Sullivan's office to say that was the case.</p>

          <p eId="para_682">In relation to that part, you are actually allowed use it. One of the principles of public procurement is around transparency. Once the competitions are advertised, if all the contractual clauses and penalty clauses, and the scope of work, are made clear, then it is allowable. There is a difference between what is allowable in public procurement, what is understood in public procurement and, in some cases, the application of public procurement rules. The EU has also recognised that because public procurement has become more challenging, and there a lot of expectations on it in terms of green and social considerations, there is a need for some practitioners to be upskilled to ensure they are applying the rules in the way these are actually done.</p>
          <p eId="para_683"> It is also important to remember that public procurement is not just a rules-based system. It is also the commercial acquisition of goods and services. There has to be commensurate focus on those commercial requirements, including penalty clauses and payment clauses, and including robust scopes of work with timelines that actually allow for that.</p>

          <p eId="para_684">I am really tight for time. The Department has a piece of work to do on awareness because certainly the witness who was before us told us they were not allowed to put in penalties for non-delivery.

The two things that we have to manage at the same time are the need to drive value for money across all projects of all scales and to make sure that taxpayers' money has an impact. There is also a strong sense that where we overly regulate, or where the level of regulation that we apply in areas is overly complex, that actually imposes costs and reduces value for money.

          <p eId="para_734">I have a report to hand indicating that Department of housing officials raised concerns about this issue as far back as March and there were attempts to communicate with Mr. Moloney's Department. It states that the officials "repeatedly sought" a meeting on the project with housing officials, later "requesting discussions as soon as possible" as a decision was due to be made on the future of the homes by May. The Department of housing officials were seeking a meeting with officials from the Department of public expenditure, with the issue being flagged as far back as March. The report further states: "In one email, housing officials sought an urgent meeting with the Department of public expenditure and reform about the project and it was deemed as urgent." There was a sense of urgency and, it seems, repeated requests for meetings to be held with Mr. Moloney's Department. That is concerning to me given the evidence we have heard at this committee, which is in the public domain, that the developers were ready to go on site within a week of the decision being taken on 3 June to collapse the bundle. These attempts by Department of housing officials to engage with the Department of public expenditure seemingly were going on in the background. Will Mr. Moloney enlighten us in this regard?</p>

          <p eId="para_745">A key infrastructural project that was curtailed back in 2021 was the N11-M11 upgrade scheme, which is key not only for my constituency but also key for the greater good. Concerns were expressed when the decision was taken in 2021 to mothball that project. A particular concern was expressed by the Road Safety Authority at the time in respect of the N11-M11 scheme and a number of other key road projects across the State. Are the concerns expressed by the authority feeding into the review process?</p>

          <p eId="para_746">As I said earlier, it is an active negotiation. The Minister, Deputy Chambers, has met with the Minister for Transport several times. I imagine the balance between road, rail and other forms of transport is key to the Minister for Transport's considerations in terms of what decisions he makes when he gets an allocation. This month, we will agree the five-year allocations by Department. The sectoral Ministers will then have a period to identify the projects with which they will proceed.</p>

          <p eId="para_747">I have engaged with the Minister on this issue but I wanted to flag it here. It is a key project and mothballing it back in 2021 was the wrong decision not just for Wicklow but for the greater good. It has a negative economic impact on the wider economy when thousands of commuters are stuck in traffic and delivery of goods and services is delayed. It is an oxymoron that vehicles are left idling in traffic when the funding was pulled for environmental reasons and redirected. I hope the scheme will be looked at on foot of the review and the decision reversed.</p>

          <p eId="para_750">I have a few practical questions and an observation. I will put all my questions and my observation in one go.</p>
          <p eId="para_751"> I am conscious of the workload of the Department of public expenditure and other Departments. A continuing theme is staff vacancies, an inability to predict when people will retire and the uncertainty around that. Department heads must have some idea how many staff are going to retire but that issue is a recurring theme, along with vacancies, recruitment and retention.</p>
          <p eId="para_752"> I have a specific question on the Land Development Agency. I understand Mr. Moloney's Department and the Department of housing are the sole shareholders in the agency and quite an amount of money was allocated to it. Were any more sums allocated in 2024 or 2025? An equally important question relates to the oversight role of the Department of public expenditure in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_753"> My observation concerns the tenant in situ scheme. I am one of those who highlighted that it was being withdrawn and local authorities were being left in the lurch.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">However, I echo the comments Mr. Moloney is making that there are equity issues in this regard. It is a scheme that should be reviewed. I am the first, as a TD, to call for the tenant in situ scheme as an emergency response, but we have got into a situation with an emergency crisis that has gone on for way too long in housing. Every scheme is a reaction. This is a cause of serious concern to me, as is the help to buy scheme. While as a TD I am calling for the tenant in situ scheme, at the same time, I am calling for an absolute review of it because I know of people on a waiting list for up to 20 years in Galway. Their place on the list means nothing when someone is in trouble in relation to a house. I am the first to be shouting for that person too but we need a policy here. We need a review of it. I echo what Mr. Moloney is saying. I will stop because I want to give him a chance to answer.</p>

          <p eId="para_803">It is. Essentially, it takes account of the time value of money. Money that you should have had a year ago is charged interest to make it equal in economic terms. Interest, as such, is not a penalty within the terms of the tax Act.</p>

If it is over €200 million, it is subject to Government approval. Government approval involves going to the major projects advisory group. There is an external assurance process and the business case then goes to Government. Anything that is subject to the infrastructure guidelines will either be subject to checks and balances within the Department itself as a matter for its Accounting Officer or it will come into our Department for assessment as well.</p>

It worried me and I thought of other major projects that are happening. The Minister of State, Deputy Harkin, stated in the Dáil one day that a surgical hub will be put in place in Sligo hospital.

          <p eId="para_828">I thank the witnesses for staying with us. I have a couple of follow-up questions. To return to the theme of housing and the significant issue of local authority vacant housing and voids, it has been estimated that there are more than 3,000 vacant properties across the country. In respect of value for money and public expenditure, when we are spending €50,000 a year on emergency accommodation per family and close to €20,000 a year per individual, how does it make sense that we have such a large stock of vacant local authority housing, with the local authorities stating there is a funding issue with bringing many of those back into use? Does the Department have a role to play in ensuring value for money in terms of how it is spent in respect of housing needs, in order that we can get those properties back into use, instead of spending it on emergency accommodation for example?</p>

          <p eId="para_829">Primarily, the decisions about how to spend the housing budget are a matter for the Department of housing, but we have, over time, taken part in discussions at various different stages about specific funds to tackle voids. It has been an ongoing issue and we all accept that using the existing housing stock makes a lot of sense. For the sake of value for money we wish to do that.</p>

That is welcome. It is a project of a scale of €1.3 billion. Can Mr. Moloney clarify that a contract will be signed for that project? It is obviously a very large-scale project. Will the Department have a role in overseeing the robustness of the content of that contract?

          <p eId="para_835">What I am getting at is the key vacancies that exist in front-line services. I met the INMO recently to discuss some of the gaps in its services in terms of workforce staffing levels not being adhered to in previous agreements. The representatives mentioned not having security staff at accident and emergency department doors at night for example. They mentioned that when it comes to administrators and managers, if something has to be purchased, it has to go through five or six different decision makers. What is the Department's role in ensuring that when recruitment is taking place, it is in critical front-line services and where there are gaps in the services, as opposed to just adding more administration and bureaucracy to the systems? That is a critical issue for this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_836"> Many people would say we are heavy on administrators and seriously lacking in front-line services. Does the Department have a key role in trying to turn the dial on that?</p>

There can be real challenges with some front-line services in getting vacancies filled. However, we take the point completely about not substituting front line for administrative. We meet with the Department of Health every month and that is one of the issues we maintain a very strong focus on. </p>

          <p eId="para_880">I thank the Deputy. I have a couple of concluding questions. Ms Kelly referenced pensions earlier on. Where there is an overpayment to an individual with respect to their pension entitlements, she wants to put in place an agreement with that individual to see that repayment being made. Is there any sort of timeframe that prohibits a clawback in law? It has been suggested that there may be a four-year clawback clause there and there is no legal basis with anything that exceeds that. Is that correct, or is Ms Kelly aware of any particular time?</p>

          <p eId="para_881">I am not aware of that. On the pension, where they were on the incorrect scheme and were reduced at a lower rate, we are in discussions on all of those and agreeing over a period time how to recoup that.</p>

          <p eId="para_884">I thank Ms Kelly. On the CID contracts, to get a bit of clarity, Mr. Moloney referenced earlier on that he is aware of one other case involving a former CEO where there were some conversations held that ultimately did not materialise to anything.

          <p eId="para_887">We have not done a specific review of it. When sanction requests come in to replace or extend a CEO contract, it is one of the issues we look at one a case-by-case basis. We have not done a broader review.</p>

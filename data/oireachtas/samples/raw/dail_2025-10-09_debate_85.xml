          <p eId="para_10">Everyone is very welcome to today's meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts. Before we proceed, I have a few housekeeping matters to go through. Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 226 that the committee shall refrain from enquiring into the merits of policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies. Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I remind members of the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex. Members of the committee attending remotely must do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.</p>
          <p eId="para_11"> The agenda for today is to discuss accounts and statements, correspondence and upcoming meetings. We will then suspend and begin the engagement with Beaumont Hospital and the National Treatment Purchase Fund Board at 10.30 a.m.. Fifty-three sets of accounts and financial statements were laid between 29 September 2025 and 3 October 2025 and are due to be considered today. We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, who is a permanent witness to the committee. I ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to address these statements before opening the floor to members.</p>

          <p eId="para_12">The appropriation accounts for 2024 were presented. These are a total of 45 individual Votes. I issued a clear audit opinion in all cases, which is on the basis that the accounts properly present the transactions and financial position of the Votes at the year end. There is one significant matter I drew attention to last week, which is the excess expenditure recorded for Vote 14 - the State Laboratory. I am not sure at what point in today's meeting members want to discuss that, but maybe we can revert to that. </p>
          <p eId="para_13"> For a number of the accounts, I drew attention to certain matters. I have linked each of the certificates to relevant chapters that were included in the Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2024 and there are a number of individual items such as, for example, non-compliant procurement at a material level. I have drawn attention to that in a number of certificates and there are a number of other issues such as, for example, fines that were paid for late transposition of EU legislation. Those are matters the committee might like to seek further information about from the Votes concerned or they are matters that can be dealt with when the individual Votes are before the committee. </p>
          <p eId="para_14"> No. 46 is the financial statements of the National Oil Reserves Agency for 2024. They received a clear audit opinion. No. 47, the State Examinations Commission financial statements for 2024, received a clear audit opinion. No. 48 is the financial statements for Taighde Éireann or Research Ireland. These are for the period from 1 August to 31 December 2024 on the basis that this was a new body established on 1 August and this is its first period of account. </p>
          <p eId="para_15">They received a clear audit opinion. No. 49 is the financial statements of Transport Infrastructure Ireland for 2024. They received a clear audit opinion. No. 50 is An Foras Teanga, the Language Body. These are the financial statements for 2023. An Foras Teanga is one of the North-South bodies, and those financial statements received a clear audit opinion. For the North-South bodies, I audit those jointly with the Comptroller and Auditor General of Northern Ireland. There are approximately seven of those bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> No. 51 is the National Tourism Development Authority, Fáilte Ireland. These are the financial statements for 2024. I issued a qualified audit opinion in relation to those financial statements, as I have done for a number of years now. The accounts give a true and fair view, except for non-compliance with the requirements of financial reporting standard 102, relating to the recognition of a deferred retirement benefit funding asset for one of the authority's pension schemes. As I said, I have reported on that previously. It is a position that Fáilte Ireland has taken in accounting for pensions. It is different to what is done by almost all other State bodies I audit. In my view it should be recognising a funding asset in that relation.</p>
          <p eId="para_17"> No. 52 is the National Disability Authority financial statements for 2024. They received a clear audit opinion. No. 53 is the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland for 2024. They received a clear audit opinion.</p>

          <p eId="para_18">I thank the C and AG. Do members wish to raise any questions or queries on those? No. The first item referred to by the C and AG was the State Laboratory. A draft report was considered by the committee on Vote 14, the State Laboratory, which reports on the excess expenditure reported in the C and AG's report. The sanction of Dáil Éireann is required with respect to the excess sum. The Accounting Officer has implemented procedures to prevent a similar situation arising in the future and in light of these assurances, the committee has no objection to the sum being provided by excess Vote. Do members agree to the report? Agreed. Is it agreed to note the listing of accounts and financial statements? Agreed. The listing of accounts and financial statements will be published as part of our minutes.</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> No. 6 is items of correspondence and we will now consider items of correspondence that have been received from Accounting Officers in Government bodies. These items were received between 26 September and 6 October. The committee has also agreed to note and publish the following items. No. R0289 is correspondence received from Mr. John Conlon, chairperson of the Office of Public Works, dated 26 September 2025. No. R0298 is correspondence received from Mr. Kevin O'Brien, Department of Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation, dated 1 October 2025. No. R0302 is correspondence received from Mr. Tony O'Brien, chairperson of the Peter McVerry Trust, dated 1 October 2025.</p>
          <p eId="para_20"> No. 7 is the work programme. The committee has agreed its work programme to 6 November 2025, and has published its work programme for 2025. On Thursday, 16 October, the committee will examine the 2024 financial statements of the Health Service Executive. The committee has also agreed to schedule meetings with the following bodies from November to December. At our private session, we agreed to invite in the Office of Public Works. We provisionally put 20 November aside for a hearing with the Peter McVerry Trust, which has to be confirmed, and that will be dependent on it moving forward and publishing its accounts. The secretariat will contact these bodies to confirm the dates, and we will return to the remaining dates over the next couple of meetings, bringing us up to 18 December.</p>
          <p eId="para_21"> No. 8 is any other business. Are there any other items the committee wishes to discuss at this point? No. Fair enough.</p>

          <p eId="para_22">This morning, we will engage with the National Treatment Purchase Fund to discuss its 2024 financial statements, and with Beaumont Hospital to discuss its 2023 financial statements. We are joined by the following representatives from the National Treatment Purchase Fund: Ms Fiona Brady, chief executive officer; Mr. Seán Flood, director of finance; Mr. Eoin Darcy, director of ICT; Ms Bernadette Weir, director of commissioning; and Ms Rebecca Maher, head of operations commissioning. We are also joined by the following representatives from Beaumont Hospital: Ms Anne Coyle, chief executive officer; Mr. David Sweeney, deputy chief executive; Mr. Francis Hanlon, director of finance; and Mr. Mark Graham, director of ICT.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">We have received apologies from Deputies Boland, Geoghegan and Connolly.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, who is a permanent witness to the committee, and Mr. Mark Scully, audit manager at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General. They are very welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence. The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege. This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting. However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure it is not abused. Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> Witnesses are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in respect of an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> I now call the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, to make his opening statement.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_5">
          <from> Mr. Seamus McCarthy<recordedTime time="2025-10-09T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_28">As members are aware, Beaumont Hospital is a major voluntary hospital funded substantially by the Health Service Executive under section 38 of the Health Act 2004. The hospital's financial statements, like those of some others in the health sector, are presented with separate income and expenditure accounts for recurrent and capital spending. This format is in line with the framework for hospital financial reporting directed by the Minister for Health.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> The hospital's recurrent expenditure in 2023 was just under €660 million, of which €404 million related to staff salary and pension costs. At the end of 2023, the board employed just under 4,500 whole-time equivalent staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_30"> Beaumont Hospital's income is almost entirely from public funding sources. In 2023, the HSE allocated a grant of €529.4 million for the day-to-day running of the hospital. Recoupment of drugs costs and salaries in respect of staff seconded to the HSE totalled €33.6 million. A total of €11.4 million was received from the National Treatment Purchase Fund in 2023 and €4.5 million was received in fair deal funding. The hospital also retained €8.8 million in payroll deductions, which mainly comprised employee pension contributions. The main non-State source of funding comprised receipts totalling €29.2 million in 2023 in respect of charges for patient accommodation or emergency department attendances.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> The hospital recognised capital funding of €30 million received from the HSE in 2023. Total capital expenditure was €29.2 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> I issued a clear audit opinion in respect of the board's 2023 financial statements. However, I drew attention to a material level of non-compliant procurement by the hospital. The statement on internal control reported that the hospital had identified non-compliant procurement for 2023 totalling €18.5 million. Subsequently, the hospital identified further contracts that were procured in a manner that was non-compliant, which raised the estimated value to €20 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_33"> I issued my audit report on the hospital's 2023 financial statements on 8 October 2024. In recent days, I finalised my review of the draft 2024 financial statements, which I understand will be signed off by the hospital's board in the next few weeks when some outstanding issues have been addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_34"> On 3 July this year, the committee examined the 2023 financial statements of the board of the National Treatment Purchase Fund. At that stage, I had just issued my report on the board's 2024 financial statements but they had not yet been presented for the committee's examination. The board's financial statements for 2024 show income of €239 million received directly from Vote 38 - Health. Expenditure of €247 million was reported, resulting in a deficit for the year of €8.5 million. This resulted in a reduction in the retained revenue reserves.</p>
          <p eId="para_35"> The board secures treatment and assessments for patients on public waiting lists from private hospitals and from public hospitals that can offer spare capacity. In 2024, payments made to private hospitals amounted to €155 million, while payments to public hospitals amounted to €80 million. Payments to individual hospitals are not shown in the fund's financial statements.</p>
          <p eId="para_36"> The board's payroll costs and other administrative expenditure amounted to €12.3 million in 2024. Included in this are administrative costs of just under €1 million in respect of the board's function to negotiate with private nursing homes on the charges they impose on residents availing of the HSE's fair deal scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_37"> I issued a qualified audit opinion in respect of the board's financial statements for 2024. However, the qualification is only in respect of the accounting treatment of retirement benefit liabilities for the board's staff, which are recognised only as they fall to be paid. This is not in line with generally accepted accounting practice but does comply with the accounting directions of the Minister for Health, which are common to a number of health sector bodies I audit. In all other respects, I am satisfied that the financial statements present a true and fair view of the board's financial situation at the year end and of its transactions for the year.</p>

          <from> Ms Fiona Brady<recordedTime time="2025-10-09T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_39">I thank the committee for the invitation to appear before it today to discuss the role of the National Treatment Purchase Fund within Ireland's public healthcare system. I acknowledge my NTPF colleagues in attendance today.</p>
          <p eId="para_40"> By way of background, I was appointed chief executive of the NTPF in July 2023, following five years as chief executive of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, and Louth County Hospital. Prior to that, I was chief operations officer and director of unscheduled care. I also worked with the national clinical programmes on a project for the emergency medicine programme. I began my career in clinical practice, having trained as a nurse and midwife.</p>
          <p eId="para_41"> The NTPF carries out three core responsibilities within the public health system. The first is commissioning treatment and care. This includes inpatient and day case procedures, outpatient procedures and endoscopies for patients experiencing the longest waiting times. Second, we facilitate the management of hospital waiting lists by collecting, collating, validating and publishing national waiting list data. Third, we negotiate nursing home rates by setting the maximum prices for long-term residential care in private or voluntary nursing homes under the nursing home support scheme, NHSS, a function that is critical both for protecting residents and safeguarding public finances. In 2024 alone, the NTPF concluded more than 300 negotiations with individual private and voluntary nursing homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_42"> Today, I will focus primarily on the NTPF's commissioning role, outlining our approach and our impact on patients. I will also provide an update on the actions we have taken in recent months in response to concerns regarding the misuse of NTPF funding for approved insourcing initiatives within public hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_43"> The NTPF enables public patients to access timely care through two commissioning pathways. Insourcing is where funding is provided directly to public hospitals to deliver additional treatment or outpatient consultations beyond their core HSE-funded activity. Second is outscourcing, where the NTPF procures treatment and care for public patients in private hospitals. Currently, outsourcing represents approximately 70% of all NTPF commissioning expenditure, while the remaining 30% is insourcing expenditure.</p>
          <p eId="para_44"> Robust governance and oversight arrangements are in place for all commissioning activity. Outsourcing agreements are governed by legally binding contracts between the NTPF and the treating private hospitals. Similarly, public hospitals undertaking insourcing initiatives are required to adhere to the principles of a formal memorandum of understanding, MoU, setting out their obligations in relation to NTPF-funded work.</p>
          <p eId="para_45">Since 2019, the NTPF has arranged treatment and care for more than 1 million public patients, supporting the health system in progressing towards the waiting time targets set out under Sláintecare. In 2023 and 2024 alone, over 500,000 public patients accessed surgery, consultant appointments, endoscopies or diagnostic scans sooner as a direct result of NTPF commissioning. </p>
          <p eId="para_46"> As previously communicated to this committee, following allegations of non-compliance with NTPF insourcing processes, the NTPF conducted a comprehensive insourcing assurance review during May and June 2025. This review covered 38 public hospitals that had applied for and received approval to undertake NTPF-funded insourcing initiatives. Each hospital was formally requested to confirm that all NTPF-funded insourcing activity had been delivered in accordance with the signed MoU and the NTPF’s governance procedures. All 38 hospitals responded and the NTPF was satisfied with the responses of 35 out of 38 hospitals that they had delivered their insourcing initiatives in full compliance with their MoUs. There were three hospitals that breached the principles of the MoU but there are no ongoing concerns from an NTPF perspective in these cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_47"> Beaumont Hospital was excluded from the insourcing assurance review as all of its NTPF-funded insourcing initiatives had already been suspended on 11 April 2025 following reported concerns regarding compliance. The NTPF acknowledges that it continued to fund insourcing initiatives at Beaumont Hospital in the absence of the hospital returning a signed MoU. This action was taken as the previously signed MoU was still in place, the terms had not changed and in the interest of ensuring long-waiting patients received their much-needed care. The National Treatment Purchase Fund and Beaumont Hospital continue to work collaboratively to improve waiting times for patients. While insourcing has been temporarily paused, the NTPF remains actively engaged with Beaumont Hospital to provide outsourcing solutions for long-waiting patients. In addition, the NTPF undertakes administrative validation of waiting lists to ensure their accuracy and Beaumont Hospital remains fully engaged in the NTPF audit process. The NTPF is fully committed to maintaining this collaborative relationship and is pleased to continue working with the management team at Beaumont Hospital to support the effective management of patients and waiting lists.</p>
          <p eId="para_48"> The NTPF is continuing to strengthen its insourcing processes with the aim of improving access to care for patients. As part of this, the NTPF is introducing enhanced monthly tracking and monitoring of all insourcing activity in relation to waiting list volumes and wait times. This will support a more targeted approach, helping to ensure that patients are seen more quickly and that overall efficiency leads to shorter waiting times for treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_49"> The NTPF welcomes the Minister and HSE’s commitment to driving greater productivity across our health service especially in light of the new public-only consultant contract. The executive and staff of the NTPF are ready and committed to working closely with the Department of Health and the new regional structures to deliver a more focused and collaborative approach to managing waiting lists, fully aligned with the ambitions and targets set out in Sláintecare.</p>

          <p eId="para_50">I thank Ms Brady. I now invite Ms Coyle to provide the opening statement on behalf of Beaumont Hospital. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_9">
          <from> Mr. Anne Coyle<recordedTime time="2025-10-09T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_51">Good morning. I thank the committee for the opportunity to discuss Beaumont Hospital’s annual financial statements for 2023.</p>
          <p eId="para_52"> The last two years have seen significant change for Beaumont Hospital. A new board has been appointed with a strong focus on ensuring that appropriate governance processes are in place to support strategic and operational delivery. I was appointed as CEO just over a year ago and I have led the recruitment of almost the entire leadership team, filling positions that were either vacant or filled by staff in an interim capacity.</p>
          <p eId="para_53"> Beaumont is a complex model 4 hospital representing the largest catchment area in the entire country and it is growing. Our most recent data shows that our hospital is getting busier. Despite this growth, we have achieved measurable improvements in our patient flow and quality of patient care, which our key performance indicators illustrate. Patients and staff are front and centre in everything that we do and are at the core of our new 2025-30 hospital strategy, Building Excellence in Care, Together, which launched earlier this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_54"> The hospital has a very ambitious capital development plan, which is supported by the HSE. The eagerly anticipated cystic fibrosis building will open in quarter 4 of 2025 and represents a significant first step in our journey to improve our services for patients and staff. It is acknowledged that there is an ongoing need for infrastructural investment in Beaumont Hospital for us to continue to deliver access to safe, excellent care and improve service efficiency and productivity. We are working with colleagues in the HSE to advance refurbishment of our existing capital infrastructure and accelerate new capital developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_55"> In terms of other developments, I am pleased to announce the successful implementation of our Beaumont Hospital information system, BHIS, replacement project. Project Coral, our new clinical information system, went live in September 2025. The project represents one of the most transformational clinical system upgrades in the hospital’s history and was designed to modernise operations, enhance patient care and strengthen future readiness. It is a milestone achievement for our staff and our organisation. We are incredibly proud of what has been accomplished and are thankful to the HSE for supporting this critical infrastructural project.</p>
          <p eId="para_56"> While such achievements demonstrate progress in our management at the hospital, we are very much still in a transitionary phase of change and improvement. We acknowledge that there is still work to do to enhance our systems of governance as highlighted in our statement of internal controls for our annual financial statements 2023, AFS23, which we will detail today for the committee. Accordingly, I will draw the attention of the committee to AFS23 as I outline its key points. The board acknowledged in its statement of internal control that there was a risk that hospital performance on service delivery and budget control was challenged in 2023 against a backdrop of service pressures previously noted. Since 2023, the board and executive team have been working together to revise our governance processes. This has included external governance support and the establishment of reconstituted subcommittees, with new terms of reference and operational polices being implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_57"> I will now address a few specific items, the first of which is non-compliant expenditure. In relation to non-compliant expenditure, the hospital provided a list of non-compliant expenditure to the secretariat of the Committee of Public Accounts in August. We are continually balancing the need for competitive tendering with the need to respond to immediate service continuity risks, which are under continuous oversight by the hospital. The reports on the level of expenditure where the related procurement complied with procurement rules showed that compliance levels increased from 91.8% by the end of 2023 to 93.3% by the end of 2024. We are very conscious of the need to make further improvements towards the achievement of full compliance and are focused on taking all necessary action to realise this.</p>
          <p eId="para_58"> In March 2025, the hospital made a self-disclosure to the NTPF regarding the possibility of non-compliance with the NTPF MoU within rheumatology outpatient clinics. The NTPF subsequently paused the funding of all NTPF initiatives provided by the hospital pending review. HSE internal audit undertook a fact-finding review that is now complete. Included in the findings was that Beaumont Hospital billed the NTPF for €25,000 in error for rheumatology waiting list services that had already been funded by the Health Service Executive. This amount has been reimbursed to the NTPF At all times, the hospital’s overriding focus was actively managing waiting lists for rheumatology during the review period to ensure waiting times were reduced and maintained. The report confirms that, throughout the period under review, NTPF funding enabled the delivery of around 1,700 rheumatology treatments, which contributed to these waiting list initiative results. Beaumont Hospital accepts the findings of the HSE internal audit report and is committed to implementing the recommendations made in relation to the hospital. Beaumont Hospital confirms no rheumatology consultant received any additional income or reimbursement related to treatment clinics billed by the NTPF. Beaumont Hospital and the NTPF continue to work collaboratively to improve waiting times for our patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_59"> The hospital, as a local, regional and national service provider, remains committed to strengthening clinical governance, patient safety and risk oversight, and ensuring that lessons from legal claims, Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA inspections, and national patient surveys are embedded into governance processes.</p>
          <p eId="para_60"> I am available for any questions.</p>

          <p eId="para_61">I thank Ms Coyle. I advise everyone that we will suspend the meeting for about ten to 15 minutes at 12 o'clock. I will now open the floor to members.

          <from> Ms Fiona Brady<recordedTime time="2025-10-09T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_63">No, it was not. I met Ms Coyle and we had several conversations about this. We both decided that there would not be a knee-jerk reaction to how the disclosure was made. I agreed to go back to the NTPF and look at a year's invoices. We picked 2023 because that was post Covid and post cyberattack. It was the first full year back for commissioning and the health service was fully operational. We reviewed one year's invoices and I sent them to Ms Coyle. She reviewed them and then confirmed to us that, in fact, we had been invoiced for activity that went on in core hours. We did not take it lightly. We were concerned and we brought it to the board. We did continue outsourcing and we did continue the validation process as well. Insourcing is just a tiny part of what we do for Beaumont Hospital.</p>

          <p eId="para_65">As of today, it has not. The report is not long published. I have brought it to the board and the NTPF has received the assurances it needed to restart insourcing.</p>
          <p eId="para_66">I have communicated with Ms Coyle earlier in the week that we will meet and begin the arrangements to restart insourcing. We will be doing it.</p>

          <p eId="para_67">What are the consequences for the other three hospitals that have been flagged as part of that 38-hospital review - Naas, Kerry and one in Dublin - arising from the fact they have not worked within the MOU? Have they been reinstated or will they be?</p>

          <p eId="para_68">In relation to Kerry, we are not doing any commissioning with Kerry at all at the moment. That is their decision, their choice. They have not asked us for anything. They have completed the assurance review in St. Michael's. The initiative that had been ongoing had been completed by the time I did the assurance review. They have not looked for any funding at all, so there is nothing there. Naas have been fully engaged with us and I think the internal auditors from the HSE are in there doing a review at the moment, so we are awaiting the outcome of that. </p>

          <p eId="para_75">The only money we have recouped so far has been from Beaumont Hospital. We have not looked for any of the funding from Naas hospital or from Kerry. It is public money. It is not our money, essentially. We are funded by the Department of Health. We have not looked for any money back from Kerry or from Naas. </p>

          <p eId="para_79">They would not have been paid twice. We do not pay consultants. The issues that pertained to Naas and Kerry were that the package of money that we agreed for the initiatives was paid directly to the consultant. They were not paid twice, because it was all done outside of core hours so they had already done their HSE core activity. They were not paid twice. Essentially, our money did treat patients that were on a public waiting list.</p>

          <p eId="para_80">But they would have been treated otherwise. For Naas, for example, if I read the reporting right, the NTPF funding seems to have been spent during normal working hours, not outside them.</p>

          <p eId="para_93">The figure of €25,000 relates to the period 2019. The fact-finding review the HSE internal audit undertook focused solely on rheumatology. One of the recommendations of the HSE fact-finding review is that Beaumont Hospital now continue that and look at a further range of specialties that were funded by the NTPF. That is a further eight specialties of which we will now undertake our own fact-finding review. The outcomes of that will be reported to the regional executive officer of HSE Dublin north east.</p>

On the funding we received, there was an overpayment to Beaumont Hospital and that funding has been returned.

          <p eId="para_110">Before pre-empting the outcome of that, in relation to the rheumatology example, what happened there was an overlap in a consultant starting in post, so that was funded by the HSE and the money was covered for that period by the NTPF.

Is there parallel between potentially an absence of governance and leadership in a year when we have seen so much spend? Do we have any cause for concern with regards to IT overspend or delays with projects? Have the issues of oversight, leadership and governance been addressed in those areas?</p>

On the oversight with the finance subcommittee, this has been a reconstituted committee. It has recently taken that responsibility around IT. It is just part of our governance infrastructure. We have recently strengthened our governance infrastructure, for example around capital. The infrastructure covers the capital developments that are planned, and we hope will be realised over the next few years. The board also receives those reports from the finance committee. The Deputy is right that it is a busy subcommittee but there are meetings, subcommittees and workstreams that feed into that. </p>

There was a capital allocation of €5.1 million and we spent €4.1 million to date, but there are additional works to happen in 2026. On the revenue side, there is a projected cost of €5.24 million. We received €660,000 in 2024. We have outstanding funding of €4.58 million, which is agreed with the HSE to fund in 2025. There were delays. It was nine months. The cost of that delay was €197,000 because we hired staff and the project had not begun yet.</p>

          <p eId="para_126">It is phenomenal to hear that the NTPF provided almost 500,000 treatments in the year alone. That is an incredible number. It is an incredible benefit to the people who are waiting on these waiting lists. When I think about consultants and the money they are earning, consultants deserve to be paid great amounts because they provide immense value. They should be compensated for incredible performance. Where consultants can clear a waiting list, they absolutely should be paid for that but my fear is that the NTPF could be incentivising consultants to delay. Does Ms Brady believe that consultants are incentivised to leave people on their waiting lists so that they get transferred to a NTPF list where they could subsequently benefit from same? </p>

          <p eId="para_127">No, I do not believe that is true because the management of the waiting list lies with the acute hospitals. The management in the acute hospitals need to manage the wait times and volumes on their waiting lists. The NTPF only steps in at a certain stage. There is an expectation there for every manager within the hospital to have their own waiting list action plan. There is a national one, but each hospital have its own. I had one myself in Drogheda as well. If someone felt that a waiting list was falling behind a little, it is up to the manager to call in the consultants or the speciality team and have a word with them in relation to that. The NTPF steps in to assist, but the hospitals have to do their bit first. </p>

It just seems like it is almost like a direct debt to the hospitals. It does not seem like it is related to the volume of work that is being done.

          <p eId="para_151">If 25% of TDs did not return their declarations of interest, we would be dragged over hot coals. If 25% of the consultants are not answering it, that points to the people who are probably benefiting from insourcing or other things like that. There is a body of work to do there. If consultants are not complying with their SIPO obligations, that is really serious - 25% is a big proportion for any hospital. I have no doubt that is not just Beaumont. I would say other hospitals are similar as well. Does the NTPF check whether consultants are compliant with their SIPO obligations?</p>

One has a labelling error, the files in another do not agree with the Department of Health's version of the file and there is another where the total sum does not agree with that of the Department of Health. An example I found quite concerning was that quarter 4 of 2019 and quarter 1 of 2021 had the exact same number of payments. There were 8,283 payments in both of those quarters and I find it incredible that two quarters have the exact same number of payments. There is no other quarter that is anywhere close. It might be a coincidence but it looked like it must have been an error. I find it hard to believe it was the exact same number. The chances of that are slim to none.</p>

It has exceeded the expectations in terms of the uptake and meeting the anticipated numbers that were going through it.

          <p eId="para_214">I welcome everyone here today. I have a few questions which I would like to get down to the nitty-gritty on. My first question relates to consultants. When consultants receive a contract from the HSE, are they given a specific number of hours they have to work every week? </p>

          <p eId="para_215">Mr. Sweeney is better placed to answer that question in his role from a HR point of view. There are different types of consultant contracts. The most recent consultant contract is the public-only consultant contract in 2023. All new consultants who join the HSE and Beaumont Hospital will join us on the public-only contract. Currently in Beaumont Hospital, there is an 81% uptake among our consultants of the public-only contract. Some people have other contract types, and they can choose to either opt in or to retain their existing contract. A number of our consultants have chosen to do so. </p>

          <p eId="para_230">To take a patient who is waiting in Beaumont Hospital for a cataract operation as an example, we go out to tender and procure cataract services. We know there are long waiting lists for such services. We look at the all the long-waiting patients across all of the hospitals and the capacity available to us in the private sector. We identify the long-waiting hospitals – Beaumont Hospital in this example - and we take, say, the 50 longest-waiting cataract patients. We prepare a file. It is on our system. We tell the hospital that we have identified these 50 long-waiting patients and there is local capacity available for them in the private system. We ask the hospital to check whether these people are clinically suitable to go across, because some are and others are not. For those who are suitable, we ask the hospital to contact them and offer, for example, treatment in the local private hospital. As soon as they accept, our system is updated and we notify the private hospital to expect a file from Beaumont Hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">It will transfer that file and the private hospital phones the patient, arranges a suitable time for him or her to come in from a pre-op operation and, if he or she passes that treatment, for the surgery.</p>

There will then be questions seeking more information. Then we apply our four criteria. These are the price previously charged, costs recently and prudently incurred, the county average and the budgetary constraints of the State.

          <p eId="para_265">I will put my other hat on in Drogheda. Ms Coyle and Mr. Sweeney mentioned consultant contracts and work schedules earlier. All staff, particularly consultants who we are talking about here, have to sign a work schedule of what they are planning to do within core activity on a weekly basis in the acute hospital service. They will typically have two outpatient clinics, an on-call, a post-call and their specialty rounds. When those 37 hours are complete and they have completed all of their clinics, that typically means they have fulfilled their core activity hours.</p>

          <p eId="para_274">To clarify, because there may be a level of confusion, the consultant contract allows for a 37-hour week. Over and above that, there is an on-call provision, but consultants will routinely work in excess of their 37 hours without any recompense. Regarding the NTPF funding, it is cheaper to be self-sufficient on an insourcing model as opposed to outsourcing.</p>

          <p eId="para_275">I understand that but what I am getting at is whether the core funding system allows consultants working in the core funding model of 37 hours-plus to do extra hours to try to clear patient backlogs. My point is that they are not going to do that if they can get funded through the insourcing model, which is more lucrative for them. That is the key point. There is a disincentive for them to do additional work on the public waiting lists under the core funding system. This is exactly what the HSE report seems to suggest, that it is a disincentive, which is why the HSE chief is suggesting that insourcing should be phased out by the summer of next year.</p>

          <p eId="para_309">On the reduction in Beaumont Hospital's NTPF funding, we went into 2025 with an intention to make a deliberate shift in our waiting list strategy. Our priority in 2025 was to reduce our reliance on externally funded initiatives and to focus on building sustainable capacity within our own services and across our regional networks. With our dermatology waiting lists, for example, we are doing a lot of work with Connolly Hospital, and we are doing gynaecology work with the Rotunda Hospital. We have seen productivity gains through a reduction in our did not attend, DNA, rates. Although we have seen quite a significant increase in referrals and demand for our services, for a similar period this year, we are seeing quite a significant increase in our referral volume through our own internal clinics.</p>

I have a list of questions and I will do my best to ask them in a straightforward manner. Members of my family have been in Beaumont Hospital and were treated exceptionally. They have been dealt with really well and I want to say "Thank you" for that. My questions are from a compliance perspective, notwithstanding all the amazing work that is done every day for the people the hospital treats.</p>

There might be a diagnostic involved, the patient will be brought in, there might be a porter or a nurse on site, there might be a consultant, and the cost of an X-ray might need to be covered. We would agree then with the public hospital that we will fund it for an additional €300 - for example, orthopaedic outpatient appointments at a cost of €200 per patient for the year ahead. It is then for the public hospital to administer those clinics and they will invoice us for those. We will compare then when the invoices come in and we will check that those patients were long-waiting patients on a public waiting list in that hospital.</p>

In terms of the commencement, we agree the terms with which the initiative will be undertaken, the method of delivery, the price and the volume and then, when that activity has been completed, the public hospital invoices the NTPF to secure the funds. However, we are moving into a different era. We are moving to the removal of the insourcing model. Our public hospitals are removing that.

We have three centralised waiting lists, the productivity initiatives we are doing in our theatre, our theatre utilisation, maximising the use of outpatients, as I have said, and we are working in collaboration with other hospitals as part of the network within the Dublin north-east region. We work with the Rotunda on some of those waits and we work, for example, in the management of our dermatology clinics, with other hospitals within the Dublin north-east region. Really, it is in all our best interest to deliver improved access for our patients and maximise the resources we have to hand, our theatres, our outpatients and so on.

If any consultant came to me with an initiative they wanted to apply to the NTPF for, I would review all the consultant contracts to ensure they had carried out all core activity, and everything else that could be done within the capacity of the organisation had been maxed out.</p>

          <p eId="para_422">I would argue that whether it is the applications, an audit or a summary of the process, the best way to support the argument that core work is not being double-funded, as such, is to demonstrate that by means an audit of the NTPF-funded hours and how the applications are assessed on a generalised basis. As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, that is my biggest question, and I do not necessarily have the data in front of me to answer it. Do the witnesses accept that?</p>

          <p eId="para_426"> I want to ask a question about nursing homes. We had a number of hearings regarding very significant concerns. I see a gap in the system here, where, essentially, the NTPF establishes the price, the HSE procures the service and HIQA establishes the minimum standards. A clear failure to deliver was evident in some of the coverage in the RTÉ programme. Payments were made for services and the services were not delivered to a satisfactory standard. As the procurer, is there a role for the NTPF in ensuring that the State gets the delivery docket, as it were, to the effect that it has received a service? While HIQA has a responsibility for establishing minimum standards, it clearly tells us that it is not responsible for the procurement element. Is there a gap between the NTPF establishing the price and HIQA establishing minimum standards?</p>

          <p eId="para_443">Yes. Dermatology, for example, was an area that we were looking to focus on. Initially, we continued the initiatives that were scheduled. We did not disrupt people's appointments, and we continued that at a cost to the hospital. We then looked, particularly around our dermatology waiting list, at different approaches to our use of, for example, our minor procedure rooms in St. Joseph's for dermatology. Those combined actions that we took allowed us to deliver more activity within our existing resources and to drive efficiencies for dermatology. Dermatology will achieve the waiting list action of nobody waiting longer than 12 months by the end of this year. We are on track for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_444"> We did a lot of work as part of our management of internal patient flows which meant that we minimised disruption of endoscopy procedures. We continue to ensure that patients who require an urgent endoscopy are treated within the 28 days. Again, there is a gap. The number of referrals that are coming in for endoscopy exceeds our capacity to deliver that, regardless of whether the funding was suspended by the NTPF or not.</p>

A number of our consultants have shared appointments, so there is a distinct possibility that they may have declared at another site.

Those responses are compiled and reported in through EMG and our hospital board. Where we do not have a declaration, it is not to suggest that people have a declaration and are not returning it. It is more an absence of a receipt of a response, and that aspect of lack of response could very conceivably be captured at other hospital sites. From a management perspective, we need to develop matters internally by making that a little more robust and tracking and tracing those non-declarations, but it is not to suggest that they have valid declarations.</p>

          <p eId="para_556">In 2017, the NTPF was only funded €17 million. Based on my experience of working in the public system, the reason for the efficiencies private hospitals provide the public health service with is because they do not manage unscheduled care. Every day, Ms Coyle has to come in to face a very busy emergency department with patients on trolleys - 60,000 or 70,000 presenting to an emergency department. The private hospitals do not have that. Public patients get cancelled in public hospitals because the theatres and day wards are full and there is no space in outpatients. That is where the NTPF can step in and use private capacity to look after public patients but we do not pay the consultants for that. It is already paid by let us just say, Beaumont Hospital. That is only one way we use our money. For extensive waiting lists-----</p>

          <p eId="para_560">I made the very strong point earlier that if we are using private capacity for public waiting lists, for example, Beaumont Hospital, the referring consultant cannot be the treating consultant so consultants cannot refer a person from their public list to a private hospital and then head over there and see them themselves. You absolutely cannot do that. This year, 300,000 patients will be removed from the waiting lists because of the NTPF and 180,000 patients will have a better quality of life because of what we have done this year.</p>

          <p eId="para_562">That is totally different from what we do. Let us say a public patient saw a consultant in a private hospital and needed other sub-specialisation that was only available in a particular hospital. For example, Beaumont Hospital specialises in neurology. Drogheda certainly did not have that. That is what could have happened. Level four hospitals are all tertiary referral centres for specialties that are just not available in level three hospitals.</p>

          <p eId="para_564">To return to the issue of in-sourcing, I refer to the report by the Minister that revealed that in the 27 months to the end of March 2025, close to €100 million was paid out engaging external companies that use HSE facilities and equipment after normal hours. The report revealed that 83 serving or former health staff are acting as directors in 148 companies providing what are known as in-sourcing and outsourcing. To me, this raises a number of questions. When Bernard Gloster appeared before the Oireachtas Committee on Health, he defined in-sourcing as the practice of engaging external companies or third party providers to deliver services often outside normal working hours using HSE-own facilities and equipment. Would Ms Coyle agree with that?</p>

The extent to which individual hospitals in the system are exposed to that conflict of interest or the extent to which it applies is an entirely different matter.

          <p eId="para_610">In 2019, the hospital identified the need for an integrated HR and payroll system and approached the HSE with a view to rolling out the national system as soon as possible. Unfortunately, at that time the HSE project team were otherwise occupied with the roll-out of the system to the statutory hospitals and while they were positively disposed to rolling it out in Beaumont hospital, they did not have the capacity to do so at that time. During the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, we came to the increased realisation that the system we had was at end of life. The system provider was a UK-based company that had indicated it would no longer support and develop the system we had. We felt at that time as the senior management team, and taking into consideration the impact of recruitment and payroll-related activities for a hospital that undertakes hundreds of thousands of transactions through its payroll system each year, that the circumstances at that time warranted a derogation.</p>

          <p eId="para_657">I believe there are eight reasons you would seek a derogation under procurement rules. My understanding is that the hospital procurement department did not make that decision on the derogation, as they would normally make a decision on a derogation under those eight particular criteria.

          <p eId="para_684">I am just looking back at the 2020 financial statements and the certificate I issued. There were significant difficulties in the hospital at the time. I drew attention to governance issues, a change of chairpersonship, and to the audit committee not functioning as intended or as would normally be expected. I also drew attention to the failure, or at least I did not see any evidence of it, of the board to carry out the required review of internal controls in respect of 2020. In fact, on payroll I drew attention to payroll overpayments where people had continued on the payroll after they had left the employment of the hospital. I drew attention to four cases with total expense of €294,500. There were a lot of difficulties at that point in the hospital. I also drew attention to non-compliant procurement, so that has been an annual reference in the audit certificate for the hospital. These things are connected and the committee can see the further connection in the payroll. In trying to remedy some of these difficulties there is a cost overrun on that project. </p>

Do they not think that should have been forthcoming? There is no mention of it anywhere, only for this having come up at the latter end of the meeting when a lot of the members are not here.

          <p eId="para_688">It certainly will, and I think there will be a lot more information required from the hospital. I ask that we would get a briefing note from the hospital because we will have the HSE in before us next week and I think it is going to be critical to have all that information. I am trying to tie all the pieces together. As the C and AG said, there are governance issues in Beaumon going back before a lot of the witnesses' time, but there is a very costly pattern here and the taxpayer is the one picking up the tab. There are issues there. I asked about the audit and risk committee. I think we will need minutes of the board meetings to see whether this issue has been discussed previously at board level. There are concerns there. Other members touched on board members resigning, and an explanation was given for some of those resignations. I will ask the question as to whether any of those resignations or step-downs or whatever had come about as a result of some of these concerns. May I ask that direct question?</p>

          <p eId="para_697">If the Deputy looks at our budget, our budget this year is €230 million, of which €215 million is care expenditure, so the increase has been down to the funding of patient treatments under both outsourcing and insourcing arrangements. I would point out, however, that commissioning was restarted, re-established, in mid-2017, and it takes time to build up the commissioning function. Basically, from our perspective, we think we have been very successful in treating large numbers of patients over that period. We have set out in the opening statement the figure of 1 million patients over the past six years, I think, who have received-----</p>

That is what I do not get. The amount of income that has been spent under that fund is threefold what it was. I am just wondering why. How was it happening in our hospitals back in 2019, and in 2024 it is the NTPF that is receiving such a significant amount of income towards patient care?</p>

I would like to make a strong point to the Deputy now. She may not be aware that our budget has been cut next year by €30 million, so while we have €230 million this year, we will have €200 million next year. We fully anticipated that in light of what the Minister, the Department of Health and the HSE are looking to achieve in relation to the new regions and the new public money consultant contract. They are looking for more productivity and we are getting less money, so it is going in the right direction.</p>

          <p eId="para_718">As regards the figures that were quoted there, €11,970 is a very standard rate for a relatively small public sector body, and I think €7,695 is again standard for an ordinary member of a board of a relatively small organisation. In larger organisations there might be higher payments to board members, but in any case they should always be in line with Department of public expenditure limits.</p>

          <from> Mr. Seamus McCarthy<recordedTime time="2025-10-09T13:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_720">There are a number of public bodies where either conventionally there has never been a fee paid, or maybe during the recession board members ceased to be paid. There is a little bit of sporadic difference, but I think the figures that are quoted for the NTPF board members would be the more general thing. I think maybe in the health and the education sectors members of boards would tend not to be paid. They would be seen more as making a social contribution.</p>

          <p eId="para_722">That concludes the Deputies' questions and our engagement with the National Treatment Purchase Fund and Beaumont Hospital. I thank Ms Fiona Brady and her officials and Ms Anne Coyle and her officials for attending.

The committee is now adjourned until 9.30 a.m. on Thursday, 16 October 2025, when we will meet with the Health Service Executive to discuss its 2024 financial statements.</p>

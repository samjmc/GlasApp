          <p eId="para_10">Everyone is very welcome to today's meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts. Before we proceed, I have a few housekeeping matters to go through. Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 226 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies. Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I remind members of the constitutional requirement that, in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex. Members of the committee attending remotely must do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.</p>
          <p eId="para_11"> The agenda for today is to discuss accounts and statements, correspondence, and upcoming meetings. Six sets of accounts and financial statements were laid between 24 September 2025 and 26 September 2025 and are due to be considered today. The appropriation accounts for 2024 and the Comptroller and Auditor General's Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2024 were also published on Tuesday. We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, who is a permanent witness to the committee. I will ask him to address these items before I open the floor to members.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_2">
          <from> Mr. Seamus McCarthy<recordedTime time="2025-10-02T10:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_12">I will begin with the items on the list. The Ireland-United States Educational Fund received a clear audit opinion for 2024.</p>
          <p eId="para_13"> The remaining accounts all relate to subsidiaries of Horse Racing Ireland. The audit of the group accounts is not yet completed. I expect it to be completed in the next few weeks. These are five of the subsidiaries. HRI Racecourses Limited received a clear audit opinion. Cork Racecourse Limited received a clear audit opinion. Navan Races Limited received a clear audit opinion. Irish Thoroughbred Marketing Limited received a clear audit opinion. Tote Arena Limited received a clear audit opinion. These are all financial statements for the 2024 period of account. </p>
          <p eId="para_14"> As the Chair mentioned, I also presented the 45 Vote appropriation accounts for 2024 on Tuesday, 30 September. They all received clear audit opinions but I drew attention to certain matters. I do not propose to go through the full list. Along with the appropriation accounts, I published the annual report on the accounts of the public services, which has 27 chapters. That is the material that now falls to be examined by the committee. Some matters from the previous year's report have also yet to be considered by the committee. I imagine the committee will be putting together a programme that schedules those items as it considers appropriate.</p>

          <p eId="para_16">I acknowledge the huge amount of work that goes into the annual report and the other documents the Comptroller and Auditor General references each year. They will form part of our work programme. We have seen some of them in the media over the last day or so. I look forward to dealing with them hearing by hearing. That will allow us to get to the bottom of things. I acknowledge the work of Mr. McCarthy's team in preparing that annual report.</p>

          <p eId="para_20">There are 27 extremely interesting chapters that will certainly be making their way onto our work programme, which we will touch on in a few moments. Is it agreed that we note the listing of accounts and financial statements? Agreed. The listing of accounts and financial statements will be published as part of our minutes.</p>
          <p eId="para_21"> No. 6 is correspondence. We will now consider items of correspondence received from Accounting Officers and Government bodies. These items were received between 9 July and 26 September. The committee has also agreed to note and publish the following items: No. R0270, correspondence received from Ms. Oonagh McPhillips, Secretary General of the Department of Justice, Home Affairs and Migration in relation to international protection accommodation services, IPAS, contracts; No. R0284, correspondence received from Mr. Bernard Quinn of the roads division of the Department of Transport in relation to a delay in the laying of the 2024 financial statements for Transport Infrastructure Ireland; No. R0286, correspondence received from Mr. Adrian Eustace, inspector of the office of the Commissioner in An Garda Síochána, relating to additional information requested following the Garda's appearance at the meeting of 26 June; and No. R0287, correspondence received from Mr. Niall Cody, chairman of the board of the Revenue Commissioners, on matters relating to maintaining the <i>MV Matthew</i> in Cork Harbour. I know Deputy Séamus McGrath has consistently sought an update on this matter. He spoke during our private session earlier on. Does he wish to make a comment?</p>
        </speech>

          <p eId="para_22">This merits further consideration by the committee. The total bill so far is close to €10 million for the upkeep and maintenance of this vessel. We still do not have a clear timeline for the disposal of the vessel. The key questions centre around Revenue's planning and preparation for the disposal of the vessel.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">Revenue had it for a considerable period while it was under the control of the courts. I really question the level of preparation in terms of the disposal process. That is where questioning needs to centre. I certainly suggest that Revenue needs to come before us to answer some of these questions.</p>

          <p eId="para_24">No other members wish to comment. It was agreed in private session to invite representatives of Revenue in to discuss this and other matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> Is it agreed that we note and publish all of the correspondence? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> No. 7 is the work programme. The committee has agreed its work programme to 6 November 2025 and has published its work programme for 20254. On Thursday, 9 October, the committee will examine the 2023 financial statements of Beaumont Hospital and the 2024 financial statements of the National Treatment Purchase Fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> No. 8 is any other business. Since members wish to discuss no further items, we will now suspend until 10.30 a.m. and then resume in session 3 with Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.</p>

          <p eId="para_28">This morning, we will engage with Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, to discuss its 2024 financial statements. We are joined by the following representatives from Tusla: Ms Kate Duggan, chief executive officer; Mr. Pat Smyth, national director for finance and corporate services; Ms Pamela Benson, head of legal services; Ms Rosarii Mannion, national director for people and change; and Mr. Gerry Hone, interim national director for services and integration.</p>

You are all very welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> I also wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards any reference you may make to other persons in your evidence. The evidence of witnesses physically present or who will give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege. This means that you have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything you say at the meeting. However, you are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that this privilege is not abused. Therefore, if your statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, you will be directed to discontinue your remarks. It is imperative that you comply with any such direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> Witnesses are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that you should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if your statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, you will be directed to discontinue your remarks and it is imperative that you comply with any such direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_33"> I will now call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, for his opening statement.</p>

          <p eId="para_34">The Child and Family Agency's financial statements for 2024 record total income of €1.2 billion. Vote 40 – Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth provided recurrent funding of €1.14 billion and €17.5 million for capital investment. Vote 26 – Education supplied a further €57 million, mainly in respect of the school completion programme. The agency's expenditure in 2024 amounted to €1.2 billion. Some €417 million was incurred in payroll and pension costs. This included €60 million spent on hiring agency staff. At the end of 2024, Tusla employed 5,320 whole-time equivalent staff. This was up 6% from end 2023. </p>
          <p eId="para_35"> Non-pay expenditure of €777 million was incurred in 2024. This included €299 million spent on the provision of independent placements for children or young people in need of a place of safety, including the use of special emergency arrangements due to a shortfall in existing residential capacity. Some €217 million was spent on direct grants to community, voluntary and charitable organisations delivering a range of child and family services. A total of €131 million was spent on statutory foster care and related allowances. </p>
          <p eId="para_36"> Expenditure on legal services and guardian <i>ad litem</i> costs was €38 million and €70 million was spent on non-pay administration expenses. The expenditure on independent placement provision included €61.3 million related to the placement of separated children seeking international protection. This was up from €33.1 million in 2023, representing an increase of 85% year on year. </p>
          <p eId="para_37"> I issued a clear audit opinion in respect of the agency's financial statements for 2024. However, I drew attention to the disclosure by the agency in its statement on internal financial control of non-compliant procurement of goods and services in 2024, amounting to €5.4 million. The statement also outlined the steps being taken by the agency to reduce its reliance on non-competitive and non-compliant procurement.</p>
          <p eId="para_38"> I also drew attention to expenditure on substantial legal costs and settlements arising from events that commenced in 2015 and about which there was a subsequent protected disclosure in 2017. Settlements on these matters have been reached with four individuals by Tusla or the State Claims Agency. Compensation payments to the individuals taking the cases have ranged from €49,999 to €309,000. Plaintiff costs paid in two cases amounted to €949,000. Plaintiff costs in the other two cases have not yet been determined.</p>
          <p eId="para_39"> In the case where the individual was paid €49,999 in compensation, the plaintiff costs were €870,000. In my view, the agency was obliged to seek the specific sanction of the Department of public expenditure for this settlement. That Department issued a delegated sanction to the Department of Children, Disability and Equality allowing it and its aegis bodies to make settlements up to an overall value of €50,000 in individual cases without the specific approval of the Department of public expenditure. This threshold value relates to all of the payments to the plaintiff, not just the compensation element. </p>
          <p eId="para_40"> The State Claims Agency's own costs in regard to these cases have not yet been finalised. Tusla's costs in relation to these cases amounted to €1.6 million. This includes €416,000 for an independent investigation of the protected disclosure matters, the report of which was subsequently quashed by order of the High Court.</p>

          <p eId="para_41">We will now move on to the opening statement from Ms Kate Duggan on behalf of Tusla, Child and Family Agency. As set out in the letter of invitation, you now have five minutes to make your opening statement.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_14">
          <from> Ms Kate Duggan<recordedTime time="2025-10-02T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_42">I thank the Cathaoirleach and committee for the invitation to appear before it today. I am joined by my colleagues, Mr. Pat Smith, national director of finance and corporate services, Rosarii Mannion, national director of people and change, Jerry Hone, international director of services and integration, and Pamela Benson, head of legal services.</p>
          <p eId="para_43"> It has been 18 months since we last had the opportunity to appear before the public accounts committee and the first time since the committee was established. We are grateful for the opportunity to meet the committee today and it has asked us here to discuss our financial statements 2024. To start, we would like to give the committee a broader update on our work in 2024, which marked ten years since the establishment of the agency. In the 11 years since its establishment, the agency has grown significantly, with a 100% increase in child protection and welfare referrals. In 2024, we received 96,666 child protection and welfare referrals. There have been 5,823 young people in our foster care, residential aftercare services. Some 20,839 children were open to social workers. A total of 48,443 young people received a family support service and 8,659 young people were referred to our education support services for that school year.</p>
          <p eId="para_44"> In recent years, we have also expanded our services and implemented new services in line with changing policy and legislation, such as the birth information and tracing service and the childminding registration service. We have rapidly scaled up services to respond to an almost 500% increase in separated children seeking international protection, with 893 of these young people being accommodated or in the care of Tusla at the end of 2024. </p>
          <p eId="para_45"> Many of the challenges we are facing as an agency have been widely documented and we have been transparent in discussing the increasing demand for all of our services in the numbers referred and the number of children and young people with more complex needs who also require access to other specialist services, such as disability, mental health and addiction services, to meet their needs. We have publicly acknowledged the challenges we face in respect of an inadequate supply of registered and regulated emergency and mainstream residential placements, primarily due to property and workforce supply challenges. That is also a result of the complex needs and often challenging behaviour of a cohort of young people in our care, in particular those aged 16 to 18 years engaged in substance misuse or criminal activity or those with significant mental health issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_46"> Wider societal issues, such as global movement, poverty, homelessness, domestic and gender-based violence, drugs, criminality and exploitation, significantly impact the demand for services.</p>
          <p eId="para_47">We continue to engage with other State agencies to promote interagency working to better meet the needs of these young people and their parents, who may also require intervention, particularly in relation to mental health and substance misuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_48"> We are also challenged in providing timely access to special care beds for the most vulnerable young people in our care due to staffing issues and inadequate step-down or onward placement for young people with complex needs to enable their timely discharge from special care. As a result, we have experienced increased scrutiny and criticism from the Judiciary on the impact of our capacity challenges on children and young people in the care of the State and under the oversight of the courts. We look forward to the review of the Child Care Act and the commitment to place interagency co-operation on a statutory basis and we welcome the commitment in the programme for Government to whole-of-government support for the delivery of alternative care services. Further strengthening of interagency working and the support of cross-Government Departments is pivotal to better outcomes for children and young people with complex needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_49"> It is important to recognise the significant improvements made by the agency since we were last before the committee through the implementation of our reform programme. The objective of this transformation programme across five key pillars is to ensure young people receive the right service from the right professional in the right place at the right time. Over the past 18 months, with the support of staff, executive board, departmental colleagues and Ministers, we have made significant progress. We have opened the first of five Tusla residential services since 2018 and plan to open a further 11 centres in 2025 and 2026. We have increased the number of Tusla foster carers recruited and are almost at our funded workforce, with the most social workers and social care workers ever employed in the agency. We have increased our staff retention to 93%. We have launched new supply routes for social work and social care professionals in the agency, most significantly a new social work apprenticeship scheme with 110 social work apprentices commenced since 2024 and an additional 100 places planned for September 2026. We have achieved statutory compliance with birth information and tracing legislation and successfully launched the childminding registration service across Ireland. We have made significant technological advances with the first digital integrated child record - one record, one child - developed in-house and under budget. We have published the first Tusla outcomes framework.</p>
          <p eId="para_50"> We are preparing for the launch on 1 January 2026 of the final phase of the transformation of our community services, restructuring our regions, areas and services to ensure equity of access, integrated service delivery, more focused governance and oversight, and more efficient services.</p>
          <p eId="para_51"> The agency in 2025 has an overall budget of €1.2 billion, representing a €141 million increase on 2024. This allocation reflects €75.2 million for mainstream costs, €57.5 million for separated children seeking international protection and €8.3 million for other services, including our Tusla educational support services. Additionally, we were allocated €34.2 million in respect of Ukraine costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_52"> While 99% of Tusla procurement spend was compliant in 2024, a concern of the executive and the committee has been to address the remaining non-compliant expenditure. We have taken significant actions in 2025 to address this, with in excess of €3 million of the €5.4 million in non-compliant contracts being procured.</p>
          <p eId="para_53"> Together, we have made progress. We received additional investment in 2024 and 2025 to meet new and existing demand and we know from external oversight that we are using our resources to ensure those most at risk or in need are responded to. However, significant challenges remain. When I appeared before the committee in February 2024, I noted our anticipation that service demand and complexity would increase. I stated that additional investment in capital and revenue would be needed to keep up with that pace. Today, I can say our anticipation has been realised. While we have driven savings and efficiencies, including a €30 million saving on emergency and mainstream placements in 2024, and increased productivity, we require additional investment in the 2026 budget allocation in our child protection and welfare services, therapeutic services, alternative care services, educational support and early intervention, and better interagency support to meet the increasing complexity of cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_54"> The work we do is one of the most important roles in the State and it is a privilege for us to work for this agency. We are extremely proud of our staff, who work tirelessly each day, and of our partners in community and voluntary services across the country, supporting children, young people, families and communities on our behalf.</p>
          <p eId="para_55"> I am happy to answer any questions.</p>

          <p eId="para_57">I thank all the witnesses for appearing today. I agree when Ms Duggan says her agency is carrying out some of the most important work in the State but that is why it has to be held to the highest possible standards. The case of the two missing children that has occupied discussion the length and breadth of the country has horrified everyone. Rightly or wrongly, it has brought into question the ability of the State to care for our most vulnerable children. I want to put questions on both Daniel and Kyran. In respect of Daniel, the Ombudsman for Children, Dr. Niall Muldoon, said that this devastatingly sad case left the State with serious questions to answers. We know Daniel had contact with Tusla up until 2020. What does Ms Duggan say in response to Dr. Muldoon?</p>
        </speech>

          <from> Ms Kate Duggan<recordedTime time="2025-10-02T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_58">I will refer to Daniel's case separately and come back to Kyran's case. What we have all seen and heard of Daniel's case is absolutely harrowing. I have come out publicly from the beginning to say we had contact with Daniel and his family. We are prevented from giving too much detail of the case because it is subject to a live Garda investigation. I assure the committee that the agency went to An Garda Síochána with information on the concerns about Daniel's well-being and safety. We have fully engaged with An Garda Síochána and shared all information. Our staff have met with An Garda Síochána and we have shared all files with An Garda Síochána. We have conducted an internal review, as we would always do, of an individual case. When people talk about Tusla, they immediately think of our child protection and welfare services in terms of safety of children and working with social work. However, a significant part - almost 60% - of our services across this country are on a voluntary, consensual basis where the work is focused on family support, working with parents. I am not talking about Daniel's case particularly; I am talking about where young parents may be struggling or families may be struggling with homelessness-----</p>

          <p eId="para_60">Sorry. In terms of that, I have confirmed that we had no concerns around child protection with Daniel. He was not open to a child protection service. The findings of our internal review are completed. They are being shared, as I understand, today with the Department, the Minister and the national review panel. We would support the publication of those reports when An Garda Síochána indicates it is the right time and does not in any way impede the investigation.</p>

          <p eId="para_61">Dr. Muldoon has publicly stated in respect of Kyran and Daniel that there need to be ways to publish reports that do not impede the Garda investigation.

          <p eId="para_65"> I want to assure the committee that, taking Kyran's case, the internal review of the case had some learnings and those learnings have all been implemented.

          <p eId="para_75">The common factor between both of these cases has been the Covid-19 lockdown. When we spoke with departmental officials and the Minister, the concern we had was that, where cases had been closed to Tusla and there had been concerns, those children were also not able to be in school or preschool and were not as visible within the community. We all agreed, and the Minister absolutely wanted to give assurances to all the State agencies, be those public health nursing services, Tusla services, schools, preschools or family resource centres. We have committed and want to undertake these well-being checks for approximately 42,000 children whose cases were closed to Tusla during the Covid-19 pandemic to make sure there are no concerns and that nobody slipped through the net during Covid-19.</p>

          <p eId="para_79">One of the concerns would be - again, I am being very honest with the committee - is with some of the global or internal movement of people. It is about making sure we put the best system in place. We hope to integrate with the single client record system across the State to make sure we have a PPS number for every child. This is to ensure that we give ourselves the best chance of locating every one of those children and acknowledging and recognising that they are in contact with a State service. The public now sees, and we see, two cases of concern where the common factor was a closure of services where children in that particular age group were not registered in school and were under the threshold of registration in school. That we have seen two cases means the review is the right thing to do and we are certainly committed to making sure it is full and robust. I asked the Minister to ensure there was an independent chair overseeing it so that there would be a robustness, and also an interagency steering group. This issue cuts across children who did not get developmental checks and who did not get to see their public health nurses, their GPs or their wider families.</p>

          <p eId="para_80">What is frightening to me - I say this as a parent of three kids - and the public is that, only in June, the chair of Tusla, writing in the foreword of the annual report, said that after ten years, the agency had never been better equipped to meet the complex challenges rushing towards it. How does that statement stack up with what is now being carried out?</p>
          <p eId="para_81"> Ms Duggan did not say it explicitly, but unless I am mistaken in what she said, she has acknowledged that there is at least a risk that, when Tusla carries out this review, there may well be other missing children.</p>

We have more social workers and more social care workers. We are making progress, compared to where we were five or six years ago as an agency. What we are seeing, and why we welcome these discussions, is a tsunami of demand where children and families are in very significant-----</p>

          <p eId="para_83">I do not mean for this to be provocative but is there an acceptable level of missing children? Surely that is the worst possible outcome when it comes to the care of children, that the children themselves go missing. Is there anything worse?</p>

          <p eId="para_85">How then could it have been said in a report only a couple of months ago that we were in the best place we had been for the past ten years? Ms Duggan sees how it is difficult to understand or reconcile those two statements and the reality of what we are seeing.</p>

          <p eId="para_86">I also think that, when we think about two children going missing, the immediate jump is to Tusla and child protection services even though there were also other services that were not able to engage with children and families like they normally would. There are 1.2 million children in Ireland. When it comes to child protection, we as an agency depend on all of the agencies of the State and on the public to help us protect children. That means that where there is a child and an issue relating to child protection, we have to intervene and there is social work and an open response under the jurisdiction of the courts. Where there are other children who are living with their families and are not coping well or have any type of difficulty arising, we are also reliant on other State services to flag any change in circumstance to us.</p>
          <p eId="para_87"> As I said in my opening statement, this is about society having an open discussion around child protection and the role we all have to play. It is difficult for any of us to understand when a child goes missing from one of our own communities, if it happens, how that could happen and what we can all do differently across State agencies and the wider public to try to prevent that from happening again.</p>

          <p eId="para_93">I need to say something at the outset for the public accounts committee, and we have discussed it with the Comptroller and Auditor General. We can talk to anything relating to the costs associated with these cases but we have a number of High Court orders that have been taken and are in place whereby we now cannot disclose details pertaining to the cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_94"> What I can tell the committee is that all four court cases are related. There are complex legal settlements around complex litigation but they are all on foot of a protected disclosure that was made regarding a service issue, which I assure the committee has been resolved. It is not a feature of, and did not relate to, missing children. I can confirm this to the committee because I have been asked it.</p>
          <p eId="para_95"> Those cases related to circumstances where a protected disclosure was made to the then Minister and where the board of the agency, on legal advice, engaged a third party to undertake an investigation. The High Court, in subsequent litigation, quashed that report. The committee can see what we all agree are extraordinary costs in respect of the four cases set out before it within that briefing. We have set out for the committee each of the cases, the total cost of the settlement-----</p>

          <p eId="para_100">On the third case, I acknowledge what Ms Duggan has said about being bound by a court order - I am not asking her to break that - but it was obviously an extremely serious issue that arose. Tusla carried out an external agency report, which cost it over €400,000. The report was subsequently quashed by the High Court. Somebody went to the High Court and said whatever was in that report was a load of rubbish, Tusla agreed with that, arising from the settlement and mediation agreements, and the court quashed it. That was €400,000 down the drain, as it were. Then, another €800,000 in that exact case, unless I am mistaken, was paid in legal costs, presumably to the parties. I do not know if they were the agency's own legal costs and the other side's legal costs, but the other side's legal costs were paid, so we are now up at €1.2 million or thereabouts. Then, the other side got €49,999 in compensation. How does Tusla square that circle? That is an extraordinary sum of money between legal costs and the report, with the compensation being less than €50,000. What can Ms Duggan say about that?</p>

          <p eId="para_101">It is an extraordinary amount of money. That initial report was commissioned by the board of Tusla in 2017. From 2017 right up until when we finally reached mediation on the case the Deputy is talking about in 2023, I know the costs pre mediation. They were High Court costs that were initiated against the agency. We all recognise the significant and increasing legal cost, which amounted to €720,000 pre mediation.</p>
          <p eId="para_102"> When I joined Tusla and took over the role as CEO, I had to take on this case.</p>
          <p eId="para_103">My absolute objective was to move to settle it and close it out. I did so by overseeing a mediation process. The cost of the mediation process was €149,000. It brought to a conclusion six years of legal battles on this matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_111">I welcome Ms Duggan and her colleagues. We had the opportunity to speak in the committee on children. It is great to have the opportunity to speak again here. I will reiterate quickly the points I made at the committee on children. Any conversation about the work of Tusla is always in the context of the wonderful impact on the ground that 99% of the time Tusla's workers have on the lives of children and young people. I always want to emphasise that the impact it has in many people's lives is very valuable and important and I acknowledge that from the outset.</p>
          <p eId="para_112"> I will pick up on Deputy Geoghegan's comments about the cases. How would the fee of €49,999 be arrived at? What is the significance of that number?</p>

          <p eId="para_113">I can talk to that because that was part of the mediation I led on as CEO in the case. There had been agreement to move to mediation in this case. There had been previous High Court proceedings. From those proceedings and based on all the legal advice I received, I understood that if this proceeded to full hearing, there was a chance that Tusla would lose or not be successful. The absolute shared objective of the board of Tusla was to seek to settle through mediation. When we started the mediation, there were a number of issues to be resolved within it. The initial settlement that was requested was multiples of what was eventually settled for. I knew I had a delegation to be able to sanction settlements up to €50,000. I have confirmation of that in writing. Within the agency, it has never been custom and practice that the sanction would include any associated legal fees. Often at the time of mediation, people do not have the full cost of legal fees. I knew I was working to a limit of €50,000. We also had a date for a full hearing of 6 November. That was the date of the full hearing, so there were just a few days in which to mediate a settlement.</p>
          <p eId="para_114"> When I looked at the likely cost of the full hearing and the cost of another day's mediation - there are significant costs associated with mediation - and the fact that there was an absolute indication and collective consideration that we would lose, I made the offer of €49,999 from an expediency perspective. I spoke to the chair of the board and got consent for that. I spoke to the Secretary General and principal officer in our parent Department to confirm I had the sanction up to €50,000. As I said, I got that case settled for a fraction of what was originally looked for or even of what had been paid out in the other cases that were managed in a different way, and I avoided going to a full hearing-----</p>

          <p eId="para_123">We have just received this week the initial draft terms of reference from our parent Department and the independent chair has been assigned. That is Ms Tanya Ward, who is the chief executive of the Children's Rights Alliance. She will convene an interagency steering group, which we asked for, to make sure credibility is given to this oversight. That group will meet for the first time to sign off the official terms of reference. There are just over 42,000 children whose cases were closed. We have prioritised them as regards children who were in care at the time, children who were on the child protection notification system at one time, children who were under child protection and welfare services and so on. We have prioritised how we will do it. We are fortunate in this agency to have a digital management system for all our cases so we are now looking at trying to bottom out how much of it we can automate, to have a connection with the Department of Education and Youth IT systems and school registers and school roll calls. It is about working out how much of it can be automated. When all the children have been identified along with the school or State service they are in, it will involve a contact with that State agency. It will not be with the parents. We will get an assurance from a teacher, public health nurse or some service the child is involved with.</p>

          <p eId="para_125">No, the automation will allow us to identify the children and where their schools are so that we have the most information possible. That is because right now, for example, on the Tusla case management system, if a child was three at the time, we might not have the name of the school they are in today or we might not have an up-to-date address for them. The automation is about bringing validity to the data we have. For every child, then, a State service will be contacted. For example, if we know Kate Duggan is in third class in Our Lady of Lourdes school, that school will be contacted or visited to determine the child is there and accounted for. If the school has any concerns, there will then be a direct line to Tusla to manage and respond to those concerns. However, where there is no known concern, no further action will be required.</p>

          <p eId="para_128">Okay. For example, if 10% of those 42,000 children were flagged and Tusla said there was an issue, how would the agency have coped in 2024, if it had received 4,000 referrals, creating a whole new level of workload? Is Tusla ready, like its chair says? Is it resourced to the extent it needs to be to do this work? My concern is that these checks will potentially be an administrative exercise only. That is not a slight on Tusla staff at all. Are the resources there to follow through on the potential child protection concerns or welfare issues that might come from those checks?</p>

Our staff have been dealing with 10%, 20% or 30% increases in referrals year on year. From our data and from HIQA as regards its external oversight and what it stated in its most recent reports, we know we are responding to the children who are most in need. However, we have situations where children who are medium or low priority have to wait longer to get a service. Our job is to use whatever resources are provided to us to the best effect, prioritise them for the children and families who are most at risk and make sure we are connecting children and families with other universal services.</p>

          <p eId="para_130">My concern is that Tusla will be asking the teaching community, youth workers or others to make assertions and judgments. If no clear terms of reference are offered to them, it is a big responsibility when they are also burdened by the work they are involved in. I am flagging that as opposed to questioning it at this point because it sounds like, based on those terms of reference, that it is a clarification of existence check as opposed to a welfare check, and that would be my concern.</p>

This came as a request from the Minister, even though, potentially, there were no child protection concerns. The only related thing here was Covid-19, but now we are prioritising child protection concerns as the first cohort of people we are going to communicate with.

          <p eId="para_139">It is carried over. Just to reassure the Deputy, the processes over the last three years have improved immensely in terms of the checking of this issue. To give some background, we are part of the same payroll system as the HSE. It manages the 100,000 employees down there as well as our 5,000. In common with other shared services systems for state services around the world, there is an element of delay that causes these overpayments. Effectively, this concerns what happens where information is not received around staff leaving for things like unplanned leave or other absences. This is what is the basis of it. We have put in a lot of training and processes to improve the situation. I think we are seeing an improvement on that over the last year. We expect the balance to reduce as the years go on.</p>

          <p eId="para_142">I thank the Cathaoirleach. Fáiltím roimh an gcruinniú seo inniu. Tá fáilte roimh gach éinne agus tá súil agam go mbeimid in ann comhrá iontach a bheith againn. I thank the witnesses for being here. I hope they are keeping well. I want to frame the conversation around the importance of the role played by Tusla. It has been broadly acknowledged by the Deputies here today. There is also the sheer scale of Tusla as an entity and the number of people contributing to the positive work that goes on in Tusla. I really welcomed Ms Duggan's comments around the five pillars of reform, the digitisation strategy and the fact the implementation of a digital record for each child coming in under budget. That has to be welcomed. A lot of good work is going on in Tusla and the witnesses are probably up against it trying to make it happen. I wish them the very best of luck in everything they are trying to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_143"> I will run through a few questions I have and I very much appreciate the co-operation of the witnesses in tackling them. I have to thank them. When I emailed Tusla back in May, I was responded to promptly and the organisation did publish all its purchase orders online, as it is mandated to do. That was really welcome. However, the quantity of purchase orders rose by almost 25% between 2023 and 2024. This indicates to me that Tusla is doing more outsourcing than perhaps it was previously. Is it fair to say that? </p>

          <p eId="para_144">No, that is probably not the case, but there is an increase underneath that to an extent. We changed the financial system in 2023. There was a huge programme as part of the HSE systems where we have a section called the integrated financial management system. There was a huge focus on ensuring that purchase orders were created for all purchases in advance of the money being spent so that there was much more control over that, rather than invoices arriving in and people running around looking to see what was happening. We also got rid of a lot of what are called "uploads", whereby the payments were done off the system and then uploaded. What we have got there is a lot more information. It is an indication of a lot more basic information coming into the system that we can use in a better way. </p>

          <p eId="para_155">I will clarify one piece first. We also have our own residential settings. My colleagues can explain the service imperative there. In the case of our statutories, as we call them, which are our own services, they are slightly more expensive than the bought-in services, for a number of reasons, which can be lined up. Once a child is in a residential setting and there is a need for the child to go into a residential setting, that is a very different space to the situation of a child who is just going to be in a foster care setting. I will just clarify that point. </p>

          <p eId="para_157">I think there are two things. Our colleagues in the Department might want to come here from the policy perspective. Certainly, our first port of call for any young person coming into care is that we would first want to keep them, if we could, within the relative community in terms of securing relative foster carers, or in foster care. There are, though, a number of young people who are not suitable for foster care. There will always be a cohort of young people who will require a residential setting as being better able to meet their needs. I have no doubt, however, that if we had more foster carers, more children would be in foster care.</p>

          <p eId="para_160">I would assume it is one of the main contributing factors, in respect of whether people can afford to provide this care. That is a big question for anybody contemplating going into foster caring, because it is not something to take on lightly and the costs are a big consideration. I have met many foster carers. There is a huge amount of additionality in what they have to spend day in, day out to facilitate the care. </p>

          <p eId="para_161">It is important to say that the foster care payment was increased in the last budget by the Government and that was very welcome. Additionality was also given to foster carers to support them with travelling expenses or bringing children on access visits or to appointments. There is also an enhanced foster care allowance. If the child needs to access, say, therapeutic appointments, that enhanced foster care allowance can be made to foster carers too. It amounts to up to double the foster care allowance. </p>

For Peter McVerry in particular, prior to the issues that came to be disclosed with Peter McVerry, we had three governance meetings per year. We were looking at a specific fund of money that pertains to kids who are coming to the end of care and some aftercare. That is where a lot of its money is spent. It provides residential spaces for that. It is probably easier to identify because it is a slice there. We are happy that the money that was spent there has been fully accounted for.</p>

Our numbers are falling. We continue to struggle in areas around the Dublin area to get adequate numbers of staff into the service, but that too is improving. The numbers of social workers and social care workers are increasing. We are doing that through a series of initiatives through our HR service, which is very good about setting initiatives around apprenticeships in social work, bursaries for students to attend third level education, and we have a learning programme around social care that we are piloting. It is hoped that might lead to an apprenticeship programme in social care.

Why are some claims settled by Tusla and others by the State Claims Agency? There is delegated sanction for under €50,000, but surely the agency will not know if that will apply until later on in the case, so at what stage does Tusla decide whether it will refer the matter to the State Claims Agency or keep it and resolve it itself?</p>

          <p eId="para_190">I note that no costs have been finalised for the plaintiff’s case for the two parts of those claims, for the State Claims Agency or the claim against Tusla, and that no costs have been agreed for case 4. Is it envisaged that Tusla will pay the costs and what are those costs? Will Tusla also pay the State Claims Agency costs as well as its own?</p>

          <p eId="para_191">The costs have not yet been received in relation to that case. We are awaiting the costs from the plaintiff, which would be assessed then. Tusla and the State Claims Agency will then review those and a decision will be made in relation to who will discharge the costs.</p>

          <p eId="para_196">Apologies, I have very limited time. On the fourth claim, the costs were in excess of €870,000. Looking at it, without any background, it seems the €50,000 was well under the delegated sanction and the costs were multiples of the award. Can we see the bill of costs for this case? Is Tusla happy to share that with us? Did Tusla get that bill of costs reviewed and checked by a Taxing Master?</p>

          <p eId="para_197">That was done by a cost accountant. It was negotiated from a significantly higher fee down to the €870,000. It obviously envisages a number of years of proceedings. It was over the course of about three years. It is not just one year that the costs would have arisen but over each of the years as they were paid. It is just to be mindful of that and that it is not just a cost in 2023.</p>

          <p eId="para_201"> Tusla is doing a review of 42,000 cases that are closed.

I keep saying this, but we are very lucky as an agency that in the past two years we have completely digitised our services in-house, on time and under cost. Because of that, we are now going to be able to do this in a much more automated and cost-effective way, which is important. Of course, the issue that is the most important is making sure that these children are safe and well and that no child is unaccounted for. We hope to be able to have, for example, direct access into school roll call systems and attendance systems.

That burden of responsibility, I imagine, bears heavily on all the witnesses' shoulders. We are here to ask questions, and all of us do so together in the full knowledge that we are elected on behalf of the State to ask the questions, but we do acknowledge the difficult and sensitive situations the witnesses deal with. As I said, I can only imagine that weighs heavily. We are thinking of the likes of Daniel and Kyran, obviously, and their individual situations and we are asking the questions on the basis that we want to know what happened - ultimately, that will come out - and how we can try to ensure that it will not happen again. Ms Duggan said that the commonality between the two cases was Covid and that it was felt that the limits imposed on Tusla because of Covid could have led to this. Was that the point she was making, just for clarity?</p>

          <p eId="para_246">There were a number of other pieces in terms of the timing of both those cases when they would have been involved in services. Then there was a Covid lockdown. It is back to Deputy Geoghegan's question. There was a period in Ireland when there was not the same level of visibility on children, whether that was a GP, a developmental check, their local running club - whatever it was - where people saw children and had eyes on them. I am not even talking about children open to Tusla; I mean just more generally. We do see, and there is lots of research being done on this, the impact of Covid-19 on children in terms of some of the presenting concerns we see now, even in older children, as a result of Covid-19.</p>

          <p eId="para_247">Would those cases have come to light at that time, and would Tusla have felt that there were others that might have, even as it looks back and tracks back, such that it might be able to say there could be other potential situations or cases out there that might be similar?</p>

          <p eId="para_248">I am not going to disclose anything here that is not in the public domain. When we look at Kyran's case, we all know that, up until that May, Kyran was in school. We have seen the pictures of him looking very happy and healthy and smiling on the screen. That is the last picture and image any of us have of Kyran. At that time, the school did not make any referrals of concern to us. In Daniel's case, Daniel was younger. Daniel would have been a child who prior to the Covid-19 lockdown was probably about to engage in or start with a crèche or a local parent and toddler group and all those things that all of us do that impact children at that age. Those services closed through Covid. None of us know yet, because the Garda investigation is ongoing, when Daniel died, and we do not know what the circumstances of that were. Certainly, though, we know that the last of our engagement was prior to the lockdown.</p>

          <p eId="para_250">I just want to give a small bit of context. We have two cohorts, almost, of young people when we talk about this. The first cohort is what we call young people who are in our foster care or in our residential care services, in our mainstream services. Some of those young people present with very complex behaviour. They may be involved in risk-taking behaviour. They may therefore be deemed as missing if they do not return to the centre within, for example, 15 minutes of a curfew. There may be somebody for whom there is a risk when they go out to meet their friend. We always have to allow them to live the normal life of a 14- or 15-year-old. If they do not return within 15 or 30 minutes of their curfew, they are reported as missing at that point in time. That is something under our regulations and in terms of HIQA. As regards one cohort, when we describe the numbers of missing - and I can give the Deputy the numbers and share them subsequently if he wants them-----</p>

          <p eId="para_252">For example, on a particular day, 25 September, there were eight young people within our mainstream service who were reported or documented as missing. Four of those were in phone contact with the service but they just did not come back. However, in line with the regulations, because we are inspected by and registered by HIQA, we have to report that. Separately, with separated children seeking international protection, I have described how those young people can turn up. They are largely deemed to be almost over 16 or 17 years of age.</p>

          <p eId="para_303">As we are dealing with the accounts, it is also important to give an assurance in this regard. This case dates back to before 2017. If we look at the situation in 2025, since 2016 to 24 September last, Tusla received 73 protected disclosures. We welcome that and think it is a really positive sign of people in the agency speaking out and speaking up when they have a concern. As of 24 September, only 24 protected disclosures were still open. Currently, none of those is being investigated externally and we have no third-party costs arising. We all sit here and look back to pre-2017 to something that was very complex, that was very litigious and that went on for years. We did then mediate cost effectively in the end.</p>
          <p eId="para_304"> I do want to give an assurance, however. It is important to bring us to today in terms of where we are regarding those costs and other legal costs we are dealing with now. We keep a very tight oversight of this area. We currently have about 15 cases open, or we had in 2024. Damages were paid in two of those cases. They were not paid to staff; they were paid in respect of a situation where there was an age assessment issue in relation to our separated children seeking international protection service and a data protection matter. To date this year, there have been five cases and, again, damages relating to two age assessment cases. This is where somebody we deem not to be a child or not under 18 and challenges this through the courts. There was also a defamation case. I want to give the committee an assurance around where we are today <i>vis-à-vis </i>where we are today in the context of something we are talking about that started pre-2017.</p>

          <p eId="para_308">I welcome Ms Duggan and her colleagues. I listened to her refer several times to the commonality and the main common factor in the cases of Kyran and Daniel was the impact of Covid-19. There is another common factor to both cases, namely the county of Louth, which I represent. Kyran was born, reared and lived all his life in County Louth, and Daniel spent from his birth up to the day before his first birthday in foster care in County Louth. Ms Duggan will be able to understand that in the context of the people I represent, many homes and lives have been ripped apart by the horror and devastation relating to both of these instances.</p>
          <p eId="para_309"> I am very disappointed that neither child was referred to in the opening statement. We have a full page of a briefing document that begins with the subject of child protection and welfare and there is no reference to either case, which is a little disappointing. I and three of my colleagues before me have referred to both these cases. It was stated that in the case of Kyran there were learnings from the internal report and that Tusla had learned from that. While I respect that, and it is very welcome, it is of little or no use to Kyran or his family.</p>
          <p eId="para_310"> I felt at times that when the cases of both these children were raised that Ms Duggan was quick to point out that when children go missing, people jump to Tusla, and there is a reliance on other State services to flag changes. I get that, but Tusla's primary responsibility is to promote the safety and well-being of children. This is why people are jumping to Tusla. I do not say that lightly, but I am sure Ms Duggan can understand. Unfortunately, we have one child who was missing and found dead and another is missing and is presumed dead. It took over an hour in all the responses to acknowledge that one of these children was dead. Instead, references continued to be made to missing children. It is important to acknowledge how severe it is that we have one child confirmed dead and another one presumed dead, which is absolutely shocking. Both these children were in services with Tusla at similar times in the smallest county in the country. It is important that is set out here today.</p>
          <p eId="para_311"> I would like to offer Ms Duggan an opportunity, and it is entirely up to her whether she takes me up on it, to comment on how she offers reassurance to the people of County Louth. It is probably fair to say that there are many people in County Louth who would not trust Tusla with protecting a loaf of bread, never mind a child.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">That is being honest. Many people in a small area have been impacted by both of these cases. It is up to Ms Duggan as to whether she wants to take a moment to reassure them. There are obvious downfalls in safeguarding, vetting and oversight. Are there enough social workers in Louth? Have there been enough over recent years? I will start there.</p>

          <from> Ms Kate Duggan<recordedTime time="2025-10-02T11:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_313">I am really mindful of what I can say about both of those cases. I apologise if I did not talk about deaths and presumed deaths. It is because I am so wary of what An Garda Síochána is asking us not to say, particularly in a position like mine. We have been in contact with relatives attached to both of those cases and with the wider communities to make sure we are offering support. I want people to know that this has devastated our agency and the staff in Louth, as I know it has the communities in Louth. I want to put that on the record.</p>
          <p eId="para_314"> With regard to what we talk to, Louth is one of the busiest areas for Tusla. I do not have the specific details regarding Louth in front of me but I can certainly get them for the Deputy. In the whole of the country, it is probably the area with the third or fourth greatest increase and change in demand. We are concerned that Louth does not have a lot of community and voluntary sector supports. This year, we have some additional funding to try to build that. Across the country, there are family resource centres, Barnardos services or other community and voluntary services. Louth does not have the same level of investment in community and voluntary services for families.</p>
          <p eId="para_315"> Based on the demand in Louth, we know there are not enough social workers and social care workers. We are seeing an increase and now have these new supply routes. That has been our challenge for the past three years. We just were not seeing the number of social workers we needed qualifying from the universities to be able to appoint them to the areas where we see the most need. It is really important to stress that, with the apprenticeship scheme being led by my colleague Ms Mannion, we are able to recruit local people who meet the criteria for an apprenticeship and who we know are going to stay in the local area. We are not going to see the full impact of that until next year or the year after. It is certainly a game-changer in terms of being able to invest in social work services in Louth. However, there are many very good services for families in Louth. I have been out a number of times to meet services and partner agencies across Louth. Looking at the most recent HIQA report for Louth, it talked about the fact that we are using our resources where they are most needed. We are dealing with those cases that are most urgent and of the highest priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_316"> I will not have time to talk to the reform programme here today but we are changing. For example, Louth is now combined with Meath but, from 1 January, it will be its own area with its own manager and a new team. Services will now be about multidisciplinary screening. There will be much more support for services across caseloads. There will certainly be an impact. I am very happy to meet with the Deputy separately if she would like some more information on all of that.</p>

          <p eId="para_317">I appreciate that, and I appreciate Ms Duggan's honesty and frankness regarding her concern that there are not enough social workers. I respect that. The oversight of children between the age of two and four is obviously an area of concern. Is it a priority for Tusla to close the gap? I know it is moving towards a digital integrated child record. Does that feed into this? What timeframe is Tusla looking at to close the net and ensure there are no more children in that crucial cohort falling between services?</p>

          <p eId="para_318">When I reference that I am speaking more widely than just about Tusla. Children get their three-year developmental check from the public health nurse. Children do not have to register in school until the age of six, so there is an issue between the ages of three and six. All of us, including the children first interdepartmental group and all of the State agencies, need to look at any risks that may be there and at how to ensure that children between those ages are engaged with a relevant State service. It is does not have to be Tusla. As part of our reform programme, we will now be capturing data for the first time on the children who are accessing our community and voluntary service agencies. Where children are referred to us and do not need a child protection response but we think they would benefit from a Barnardos service we fund within the community, we will now be capturing data on that for the first time.</p>

          <p eId="para_322"> I am running out of time. On the 42,000 children and the cases that were closed during the pandemic, I welcome that Ms Duggan hopes the review in that regard will conclude on 31 March. All going well, that metric will be met. What procedure has Tusla planned for cases where it cannot make contact with a child? If there is an incidence of a child who is not attending school, has not been to the doctor and has not had their development checks and there are concerns about that child, what procedures does Tusla have in place and how does it move forward?</p>

          <p eId="para_325">I have to be very honest about the concern we all share about the movement of people, whether it is people moving addresses or moving within the country. It is about making sure we have every possible issue addressed to allow us to locate those children, particularly if they have a PPS number. It is about working with the other State agencies and making sure there are no data protection issues or other issues in our way. That is why we looked for an interagency steering group with an independent chair to make sure those agencies were never going to be a factor preventing us getting the information we need to locate a child. One of the things we have committed to is reporting on a monthly basis anything of concern that we see, whether we felt that five, ten, 15 or 20 young people needed a child protection response from Tusla or whether we found we were not able to locate two or three despite our best efforts and had to go to An Garda Síochána. We want to be fully transparent in these circumstances.</p>

There were over 100,000 referrals last year, which was a significant number. We are discussing issues of concern but I am sure that the witnesses make very many positive interventions on a day-to-day basis and that must be acknowledged. I thank them and their staff for all the work they do.</p>
          <p eId="para_329"> I will raise a number of issues. Like other members, I am caught for time so I ask for short answers, if possible. In respect of separated children seeking international protection, the Comptroller and Auditor General has pointed out that there has been an 85% increase to €61.3 million for independent placement provision for those children. I think the number was confirmed earlier but how many children who are separated are we talking about at this point?</p>

          <p eId="para_383">I know it was raised earlier, but why did it take high-profile cases, media attention and so on for a decision to be made that welfare checks were required in those cases that were closed during Covid?

          <p eId="para_384">We close that level of case all the time. When we close a case to Tusla, it means that those involved do not need a service from Tusla any more, that we have deemed that they no longer need Tusla in their lives, for want of a better phrase.</p>

          <p eId="para_385">Was it possible to make that decision properly during Covid? Obviously, the level of interaction was less and the work Tusla was carrying out was restricted during Covid. Decisions were made to close cases, yet they have never been revisited until now, until we are at crisis point, effectively.</p>

          <p eId="para_386">I can only talk to the professional judgment of the individuals involved. Those cases were not closed because of Covid; they were closed at a point in time because it was deemed those involved did not need any further support from Tusla. We have to be conscious that under the legislation, under the Constitution, families have a right to privacy. When we deem that services are no longer needed, I think the learning from that is that families, when they leave Tusla and go back, often would have other professionals meet them and their parents, and that has not happened.</p>

We do not want children in unregulated and unregistered placements, we have reduced the number of children and young people in those placements, and now that we have the capital investment and the resource investment to open up our new residential units, we expect that number to decrease further.

Of course they talk about inflationary costs, and there was an investment in additional foster carer allowance granted, but they talk as much about the access to specialist services like mental heath services and disability services for children who are in care. I do not think it is quite as simplistic as money to increase the number of foster carers. There are a couple of factors. </p>

          <p eId="para_458">That is a useful clarification. On the other side of the residential care placements is the special emergency arrangements.

          <p eId="para_459">It is probably sometimes the opposite of that. In a residential environment it is very restricted and regimented. They are subject to HIQA and they are inspected.

We have young people in special emergency arrangements who we would like to have in a regulated and registered centre.

Now, that cost would have been over €900,000 and we have taken significant action in 2024 to drive efficiencies through the implementation of a new standardised rate card for that. Where that is not comparable, where you are looking at the cost of a mainstream residential placement, there could be three or four young people in that placement so the cost reduces because obviously there is not the same core level of staffing or the same bill. These are young people where there may be significant concerns around complexity of behaviour, engagement in substance abuse and maybe engagement in some criminal behaviour and, by being in a single occupancy where they are not living with other peers, they are able to cope better in that kind of arrangement.</p>

          <p eId="para_466">It is an extraordinary amount of money. I take the point about foster caring not being driven by financial incentives - I fully accept that, knowing foster parents - but surely there is some model between what a foster parent gets and three quarters of a million euro in an environment that is not incredibly dissimilar to a home though it is not a residential care placement, particularly when it is teenagers. From a value-for-money perspective that is an extraordinary difference between the cost of foster care parents and the cost of special arrangements.</p>

          <p eId="para_499">The burden of the work Tusla has unbelievably broad. The children it deals with are at risk and very vulnerable and it is very important that the Department and the State agency tasked with this very serious responsibility work in concert. A large number of data breaches have been reported since 2019. We have all sent a text or email to the wrong person but some other breaches that have been reported by Tusla are incredibly serious, such as communications going to alleged abusers letting them know where women and children fleeing their abuse are being accommodated, and an unqualified individual pretending to be a social care worker accessing a residential care unit and spending the night there with vulnerable children. We have seen a large number of incidents reported to the data protection commissioner as well as penalties and personal damages. Can Ms Duggan tell us how many incidents there have been since 2019? The information I have only goes up to 2023 but data protection incidents have to be reported within a very tight timeline. I assume Tusla has records of incidents that occurred in 2024 and even for the first six months of this year,</p>

We absolutely recognised the level of concern we had as an agency and that our board had in relation to the practices and culture within the agency that had to change to make sure we were GDPR compliant. We do not underestimate that we hold some of the most sensitive information in the State. What I can provide to the committee is, for example, the report I get every month as CEO which sets out any data breaches, what they relate to and where there has been improvement. In terms of the data breach notification, there has been a 66% decrease in the past year in the number of high-risk breaches.

          <p eId="para_504">I can certainly give an example of one along with an example of the remediation to demonstrate. As I said, we have moved to a fully digital integrated system. That means there should be no paper records. However, there was an Excel spreadsheet that had information on it relating to children in care, and it was inadvertently shared with a parent of a child in care who had the same name as a staff member. That is an example of a high-risk breach this year. Immediately after that we were able to put a blocker into our IT system in order that nobody can now attach an Excel spreadsheet without confirming that it cannot be sent another way, it is password protected and they checked the name. We are definitely at that end in moving to those technical solutions. Our highest-risk breaches were post and email. Email is going to be dealt with technologically-----</p>

We have had 1,169 incidents of serious assault against staff members in our services. That is not widely recognised in respect of Tusla. People see it within the Prison Service. In terms of the work we are doing, we have made significant progress on reducing the impact of those assaults.

          <p eId="para_536">We spoke about this with our board. We are taking a huge amount of action in terms of the physical environment, training and induction. We have used close security personnel on-site in residential units and special care units and got the permission of HIQA to do that because of the violent nature of some of the young people attacking staff. We are now at the stage where - and this is where we talk about needing help – a lot of this is when young people are engaged in substance misuse and post-substance misuse, with mental health issues and struggling to get access to services. We see that the next phase has to be focused on the underlying cause of the aggression within the young people. That is what we talk about when meeting other State agencies. We are very happy to share the report we brought to the board last week demonstrating the actions we have taken. We have been nominated for a European award for the action the agency has taken to try to protect our staff. We obviously have a duty to protect our young people, but also to provide a safe place of work for our staff.</p>

          <p eId="para_577">If we had bought that through a procured space and we have a fully regulated price, it would be more than that if we have to have one child in that placement. That's the critical factor here. The problem with a lot of unregulated placements is they are about trying to accommodate one kid. Our normal residential services are about accommodating four kids in a place.</p>

          <p eId="para_579">On 21 September 2025, we documented that there is a three-year-old in a special emergency arrangement but I have to put that into context. We had two large sibling groups that had to come into care. We made a decision that rather than separating all those children into different care placements around the country, we would place those young people together and put additional staffing, oversights, visits and all of that in place. The right thing to do was to keep the children together. Just to interpret that-----</p>

          <p eId="para_587">I can confirm that last week, for example, just over half of those young people were aged between 16 and 17. The next largest group, which was 20-something percent, was between 14 and 16. It is really important to say that we had try to place most of those young people in foster or residential care and that due to the complex presentations, they had to be moved. We cannot leave them in a Garda stations. We cannot leave them in a hospital. There is no home. We have to give them a place of safety.</p>

Nine of those children experienced a breakdown in their residential care that week; 12 experienced a breakdown in their foster care; and 28 experienced a breakdown in their home arrangement. For a child or young person to go from a home arrangement straight into an SEA, they have to be either part of a sibling group, or they are one of the number of young people we have who are, unfortunately, engaged in significant criminal activity even though they are under 18.</p>

          <p eId="para_594">Some of them can be for a period of time. We can get a call from the gardaí during the night - a section 12, where we have to take a child into care and there may not be a registered emergency placement available and we would have to place the young people. Sometimes it is because of the complex presentation of the young person. For other people or young people in residential care or foster care, that is their home, and for us to introduce somebody new into that, an assessment must be done.</p>

          <p eId="para_624">I will follow on from the Chair's line of questioning. Am I to take it from what Ms Duggan said that the reason Tusla has not reached the target of 110 special care beds is because there is a new obligation in respect of 528 children in IPAS accommodation?</p>
        </speech>

          <from> Ms Kate Duggan<recordedTime time="2025-10-02T13:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_625">When I say new obligation, it is more because in Ireland we are working within a limited property supply market and workforce supply market. It is not that we are vying to place one or the other, what we are saying is that when we wrote this plan we made two presumptions. The first presumption was based on the property market at the time. We need to have a large property to meet the standards, and workforce supply is another factor. What emerged during that period with separated children seeking international protection is that often providers, in particular within the private sector - or the community and voluntary sector - sought to move to provide accommodation to separated children seeking international protection because they deemed that was maybe easier to do. They certainly expressed more interest in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_626"> The second thing is that, obviously within the community and voluntary sector, they were unable to engage with us to scale their capacity because they wanted the issues in the WRC progressed and addressed before they engaged with us about scaling additional capacity. Thankfully, that has now been resolved.</p>
          <p eId="para_627"> The second thing is that the community and voluntary sector is struggling to get the capital investment it needs to be able to open and build units. To give an example of what we have done, we have a hybrid model with one of the community and voluntary providers where we have used a Tusla facility and the community and voluntary provider is staffing it. They are just two things that have limited our ability to produce 110 extra mainstream beds. We have put an extra 528 beds into the system, but they are for a new and different demand.</p>

When I came into it a decision was made to mediate to draw that to a conclusion. When we see what the legal costs were prior to mediation versus the costs of mediation for conclusion of the process, we could not have allowed another three or four years, and hundreds of thousands of euro, going to a full case hearing. That is what I meant.</p>

If I am then please do tell me. My concern is growing in terms of the breadth of work that is going to be consistent within these checks. Am I right to say that not one check has started yet? Yes. Right. I nearly failed maths so bear with me. I estimate we have approximately 120 days until 31 March. That would equate roughly to about 350 children per day being checked between now and then. How? As a youth worker for many years, the first thing I would try to do in order to establish someone's welfare is to ask them "How are you?". From the witnesses' first contribution with me I do not get the sense that we are going to be doing this, or that we are going to check that they are engaged somewhere else. Is that the extent of it? To me that is not a welfare check. To me that is "you exist". Am I right in the assumption I am drawing?</p>

          <p eId="para_642">I keep pre-empting this because we have to get the final terms of reference from the Department and the steering group but when I talk about the other things such as the automation and the technical aspect that is just around getting valid data and making sure we can do it as quickly as possible in terms of being able to access other State systems to provide us with information about where to look, for example. What we are saying around this welfare check, and what is very important to us in particular when we look at Children First, is that we can identify that every one of those children is engaged with the relevant State service, whether that is through the public health nurse or through their school, and that there is an independent assessment of the fact that the persons do not have a concern, or if they do have a concern that they have referred it to Tusla or that it is being referred to Tusla. That is the most critical thing. If we believe that we need to contact the family we will of course do that. If we have to go out to a school and put our eyes on a child and check that, we will. We know that the mandated persons understand their obligation. They are in contact with us every day if they think they have a concern, or if they are not so sure and they ask "What you think?". They have an opportunity to speak to somebody, to talk to somebody, and to get their questions answered. We will not be verifying that welfare check as being complete until we have the assurance from that professional or mandated person that they do not have a concern about the child.</p>

We have managed to keep it down below those numbers. To explain a little further, about 60% of those are agency staff that are brought in for rosters, probably in the residential units more than anything else because we need to have staff there. Half of the rest are in front-line posts in the regions. Then there are some extra staff brought in around projects or other pieces. It is a relatively small number. It is an area where I am not sure we are going to be able to get very low in the residential side of it. There will always be an element of agency staff there. I believe it is quite tightly controlled and is small given the numbers, which is 186 out of some 5,500. </p>

          <p eId="para_659">Can I ask one more question, if the Chair does not mind? It has been great to have this back and forth. I really appreciate it. I have one brief statement. The narrative seems to be kind of evolving on this side around the cost-benefit analysis of €750,000 per child in a special care arrangement. I have no direct experience of working in a setting like that myself but I have worked with young people and have experience of them. That cost is an investment in this child's welfare. They are often the most vulnerable and most at risk. If Tusla is saying, based on the information provided, that this cost is for 11 staff allocated to that young person, then this is wages. Simply put, that is wages. I would hate to see a headline coming from today that one child is costing the State €750,000. It is way more nuanced than that. We should give it the merit it deserves in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_660"> Can I ask about the status of the guardians <i>ad litem</i>? If this information is not forthcoming today I would appreciate a follow-up conversation. Where is the status of the guardian <i>ad litem</i> and what is happening? Does Tusla foresee any challenges for the independence of the role potentially? If I understand it correctly the role is accountable to the Minister.</p>

          <p eId="para_662">I can do that. At the moment, the director of the guardian <i>ad litem</i>, GAL, national service has been appointed and some additional staff have also been appointed. The plan is for the service to commence operation next summer. The Deputy's second question was on the independence. Obviously that is a very key point. The set-up is being designed for the office at the moment and being put in place. Particular measures are being put in place to ensure that the guardians <i>ad litem</i> are independent in the operation of their own professional judgment. This is extremely important but the service will have the benefit of supporting them. They will have the benefit of working in an organisation where they can be supported by colleagues and by managers within the service.</p>

          <p eId="para_664">I want to go back to the figure Deputy Farrelly just referenced when he said he would hate to see the headline that it is costing €750,000 per child. However, it is costing €750,000 per child. My difficulty is that when we look at its overall budget, this could be nearly 3% of Tusla's entire budget on 51 children.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">The reason I raise this is because I know the huge pressures that Tusla, as an agency, is under in a whole range of other areas. I know the huge benefit of the work that it does in those areas. Any additional services that could be provided to them would be important. The idea is that, for 51 children in special care arrangements, because either there is not an appropriate foster care place or appropriate residential care, they are put in an arrangement in either an apartment, a hotel or a bed and breakfast, and that is costing a significant fee. I am saying I do not believe that investment is well placed for that child. I think Tusla would be far better investing that in helping the child in other ways because the immediate care need, which I appreciate has to be a paramount criterion-----</p>

Those parents are saying that the amount of money they are receiving is insufficient for them to carry out their work. I know that Tusla, as an agency, is actively trying to recruit more foster parents. A conversation has to happen given that, on the one hand, a placement of any nature is costing such a significant amount of money, up to €900,000, and, on the other hand, foster care placements are costing €400 per week. If I were the chief executive of an agency and 3% of my entire budget was being spent on this model, I would expect the agency to review it to see if alternatives were available.

          <p eId="para_685"> I want to be clear that, as an agency, we advocate all the time for increased investment in foster care, whether that is in terms of their allowance or additional supports to them. We have also advocated for support with the Department, the regulator and other State agencies that have responsibility for addiction and mental health, and for them to come together to look at different models of care that might be better value for money. I know the Department has set up an interagency group to look at that. Now, with the alternative care policy, I think there is a real opportunity.</p>

There is a commitment in the programme for Government to increase the foster care allowance and ensure increases in the new initial placement payment, which was introduced this year. That is an extra week's payment that is given to foster carers when a new child is placed with them. There is also a commitment in the programme for Government to develop a pension solution for foster carers, although that is something that will have to be done on a cross-government basis.

          <p eId="para_718">A percentage of 10% is 70 children who will travel to Ireland and present unaccompanied. I think it is an extraordinary number. If Ms Duggan could clarify that at a later point, it would be great.</p>
          <p eId="para_719"> I am hopping topics here. On the issue of foster carers, I support the calls to improve their terms and conditions. One of the issues they raised during the week when they were here was the issue of the means test. The foster payment is apparently subject to a means test for things like the back-to-school allowance. I think there are easy wins in terms of trying to give something back to foster families. I would strongly argue that the Department needs to look at those issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_720"> I will not necessarily go through what Deputy McAuliffe went through in terms of savings and so on. However, that type of setting is better, and it is better for children to be in a family foster home. We must find a way to increase the number of families participating.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">It is not for financial reward; it is purely to deal with the cost of living, which as we know, has increased significantly. I hope the Department would take note of that, if possible. </p>
          <p eId="para_722"> On the upcoming budget, I will go back to Tusla if I may. I note the Children's Rights Alliance has indicated that Tusla should be getting a €200 million increase in budget. Would Ms Duggan like to comment on that?</p>

          <p eId="para_723">We are in ongoing engagement with the Department at the moment. As the Deputy knows, our job is to set out our existing level of spend for this year and our projected forecast for next year, both in terms of meeting current expenditure into 2026 and building in the normal things we have to do around pay, income, pensions and all of that. We are forecasting based on the trend, as the Deputy just said, of an increase in the number of separated children seeking international protection. We have put forward all the additional resources we would like to see. We would like to be able to respond in the right place at the right time as quickly as possible to every child who comes to us for our services. Considering there has been such an increase in the demand for our services, increased investment is necessary to meet this need. We have also looked for additional funding for therapeutic supports for children with very complex needs and therapeutic supports for children in foster care.</p>

It is important to remember how much of Tusla's work is carried out after hours and at night and over weekends. How good is the service if a Garda station calls Tusla in the middle of the night with an issue with a child? Is it quite responsive in those instances?</p>

          <p eId="para_728">I think so. We have a national out-of-hours service, which is our single point of contact in terms of being responsive. We have an out-of-hours service in just over 65% of the country where social workers will go out and attend with gardaí. In other parts of the country, we are in the final discussions and negotiations on what the out-of-hours service should look like. It is a bit more complex where there is a large geographical area, but we have a full out-of-hours-service system, seven days a week, 24 hours a day. We just want to make sure that we expand this in some of the more rural geographical locations to make sure there is a social worker present with gardaí as quickly as possible. Certainly for all of the Dublin regions and urban regions, that is in place.</p>

          <p eId="para_737">Seven of them have been in this arrangement for less than a month, and 33 of them have been in this arrangement for one to six months. That would be 40. The one who has been in the arrangement for three years would bring the number to 41. Nine of them would be kind of in between, up from one month. That changes in terms of the duration. I have with me a document that sets out all of that every week for us. I am happy to share that with the committee. It shows the providers and the costs and we submit that on a weekly basis.</p>

          <p eId="para_740">It would be great if we could get that data. For those children, what is the path out of the special emergency accommodation?

          <p eId="para_741">It varies. The route out is either into foster care or into special care. If I take that week again as an example, there were 51 children and there were 13 discharges from special care. Two of those got a residential placement, and two of them returned home.</p>

          <p eId="para_744">Ms Duggan might be able to get that information for us because of the interest in this matter.

          <p eId="para_746">That is going to be a more designated form of provision. It will not be a physical unit. It is just a single placement outside the SEAs. It will be a normal residential unit that has been designated for a period of time because of the needs of the child.</p>

          <p eId="para_747">It is important to say some of that is directed by the court. Anybody in care is under the direction of the court. Sometimes the court will direct, based on the information presented to it, that a young person needs a single-occupancy placement. Sometimes, it will be professionally directed as being in the best interests of the child.</p>

          <p eId="para_748">It is then up to Tusla to determine where the placement is, whether it is utilising the special emergency arrangements or whether it is voluntary or statutory. That is entirely up to Tusla. I suggest that the availability of that accommodation is the determining factor in where the child goes. That is the issue. It is not about the complexity of the case; it is about the availability of residential accommodation. For every social worker, every case is complex. It is probably more complex for them when they do not know where the child is going.</p>

With this system we can look, on any night, at our bed occupancy across statutory, community and voluntary, and private providers. This illustrates the progress we have made with systems of oversight and the use of the totality of the resources available to us.</p>

As I said, he was the director of one of these companies and we can see the considerable amounts of money. In terms of background checks, how does something like that escape?

          <p eId="para_757">There is no doubt at the moment that all those things have fed into processes we have and ensuring we can strengthen those processes. Obviously, in a child protection scenario, there are greater demands for background checks for different people. That information was not known when people sought and searched for it at the time of the appointment of those companies. It was information that I am not aware was available to people. Part of the challenge is that unless he was disqualified from being a director in Ireland, there is a very serious challenge for any organisation to not employ that company on that basis, even if they knew.

Barnardos is one of our key partners for youth services and family support services, and it has a project for support for advocacy for parents of children in care, which is a key project it runs and which we fund. We have a national service level agreement with Barnardos, but it is involved locally and out in the regions, providing support services to young people and families. That is really about family support and keeping families together as well as youth support. It is very key for maintaining family units and keeping them together, preventing the need for young people to come into care. It is subject to local service level agreements for the local services it provides and our family support staff have oversight of those agreements locally. They visit and check those services regularly.</p>

          <p eId="para_779">There have been concerns expressed about staff qualifications. Within Tusla itself, there are documented issues of unqualified staff handling serious cases. To give an example, the HIQA inspection in Dublin South-Central in 2025 reported that social care staff were inappropriately allocated to complex child protection cases. Social care staff who spoke to inspectors expressed significant concern about performing the duties of a social worker without adequate training. They also said their caseload could be unmanageable at times. How extensive is that? Is that concerning? Does that issue also occur in some of those external agencies?</p>

          <p eId="para_780">Mr. Hone and Ms Mannion will be better placed to talk to the detail of it but, certainly, we have worked very hard within the agency to have a case allocation framework which looks at what are the roles and what are the statutory functions that can only be carried out by a social worker and what are the tasks or duties that can be undertaken as part of a multidisciplinary team. Earlier on, I talked about the fact that more than 60% of our referrals are referrals that need family support and involve supporting children welfare. A lot of their tasks and duties can be undertaken by a social care leader or worker.</p>
          <p eId="para_781"> What HIQA talked to were the systems of governance and oversight that need to be in place because it recognises that if we do not have the resources for every child to have an allocated social worker who needs one, we absolutely need an allocated professional under the governance of a social worker, working with that family, seeing that child and making sure that child is engaged with. Mr. Hone or Ms Mannion may be able to add more on the qualifications.</p>

          <p eId="para_782">I will kick off and Mr. Hone will come in. I do not think the description "unqualified staff" accurately reflects what HIQA found. We are trying to make sure we have the most appropriate staff member assigned to the most appropriate task. That is really about skill mix. It is always done with the relevant service lead in terms of consultation and engagement, and there is appropriate supervision in place. What was reported there may have been misinterpreted.</p>
          <p eId="para_783"> Certainly, we need to get the best value from our resources. We have never had more social care workers. Of course we need more across the system. We are funded for more and we are actively trying to recruit more but we would never find ourselves in a situation where we would authorise unqualified staff to do this most complex of work.</p>

          <p eId="para_787">They are whole-time equivalents across the system. At any one time, we need approximately an additional 230 social workers. We also get caught up on the issue of what is a vacancy. Our definition of a vacancy is a post that is not filled in any capacity. There may be posts that are not filled specifically by social workers but they are filled by other qualified staff who are appropriate to the task in hand, whether that is family support, social care, etc. Our service managers keep an eye on that in terms of supervision.</p>

          <p eId="para_791">That is easy to do. On the HIQA inspection you referenced, it was at a particular point in time when that particular area had particular struggles with recruiting sufficient staff. We have reported cases that were unallocated historically, where we said they were unallocated to a social worker but, at the same time, staff were visiting children. They were social care workers whom either we employ ourselves or who were from the community and voluntary sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_792">What we report now is the sum total of the work we undertake with families in terms of all the staff that are going in. If a case is allocated to another professional, that gets recorded on our system, so we can report accurately where a social care worker is employed, and a social worker is not. Every social care worker who is engaged with a family from our child protection and welfare teams are under the supervision of a team leader who is social work qualified and CORU registered.</p>

A total of four young people from our mainstream setting are in contact with us. They are ringing and saying they do not want to go back. When this report was given to me on 25 September - I am conscious today is 2 October - four of those young people were missing from mainstream and one of those was missing for over one week.

          <p eId="para_807">There are two things. We work closely with HIQA in making sure we understand and have an open and transparent relationship with it. First, HIQA had concerns that our separated children's service is not digitised. It is just to find it because it was a new service. We will be moving to digitise that early next year. It was the fact it was paper records, and we were manually counting and returning information. Second, HIQA felt in the mainstream setting when a child goes missing, there is an immediate contact with An Garda Síochána because we say this is child is 15 minutes or more missing. However, within the separated children service, we have recorded instances in files where young people will say to us, "This is not my final destination. I am going to meet my family in the UK", or "This is not my final destination. I am going to catch up with family somewhere else."</p>

When I set out those types of numbers, we are a new service, and are still trying to staff that service at pace. HIQA will say we are responding to the greatest risks. However, in terms of becoming compliant with HIQA standards, it has to be a perfect standard. It has to be the perfect service in terms of documentation, oversight, supervision and our interagency collaboration. In 2023 and 2024, it was about reacting, responding, finding a place of safety and getting staff employed. It came quickly at us in the context of significant demand in the rest of the agency. We have certainly invested. We have received investment from the Department. We have brought that staff complement to well over 100 people now. There is certainly movement towards much better compliance.</p>

What would happen is the child will turn up at an airport, the guards would more often than not evoke a section 12, put the child into immediate safety and contact us. They would be given into our custody, and we would go from there. We would look to see if it is down the route of the unaccompanied minor or if the child is already known to our service, which sometimes happens. It only happened recently in an out-of-hours case when they were known to our service returning. It would depend on the route it would go down. However, there is a lot of engagement with the Department of justice as recently as a meeting yesterday about it with some of the staff in my office and the unaccompanied minors area within Tusla.

Is there a European-wide network of communication regarding children? Presumably there is a similar service or an equivalent to Tusla in the UK.

We have somebody who is dedicated to international social work services. Again, in circumstances where any child could be taken to England or to Europe by family or friends, we have those links. Obviously, the reason we continue reporting this information every week is because when we report it live, it remains live with An Garda Síochána in its engagements with Interpol. We have had situations where young people have been found and identified. I can think of one situation in Europe. I certainly have not been made aware of a bad outcome. I will go to Mr. Hone in case there has been anything over the past couple of years.</p>

We had a cohort of children from Vietnam coming into the country this year&gt; Trafficking was a significant factor in a good few of those cases. We have to be very careful, obviously, because it is easier for trafficking to occur in that vulnerable group. There are our cross-Border and international social services connections. We have got the new European legislation coming out in terms of the European pact, so there will be more consistency from one country to another and, hopefully, better communications built in as part of that to actually combat some of the vulnerabilities.</p>

          <p eId="para_836">It is also important to say that when we became concerned about this, and I certainly became really concerned about this a couple of years ago, we partnered with MECPATHS, which is a really good organisation that is focused on human and child trafficking. It provides training, not just to our staff, staff we fund in the community and voluntary sector and private providers, but also out to wider industry, including hotels, shops and commercial entities to look to make sure that people are aware. We could not but be concerned about those 25 young people. We know the risk of human trafficking is greater when there is movement and global movement of people. It is that commitment to work with the Garda and internationally, but also to do that wider public awareness because this is a new concept for Ireland as a whole. That is so people understand and recognise, where they are concerned about anybody who may be a victim of exploitation or trafficking. The new national referral mechanism is being looked at too, which will also look more responsibilities on different State agencies in terms of all of those issues around trafficking and human trafficking.</p>

          <p eId="para_837">Not to prolong the conversation, but I will raise the fear that children have been trafficked. The HIQA report found that safety planning was not routinely completed when a trafficking risk was identified for a child in eight cases where there were concerns about trafficking and exploitation. In one case where a child said they felt unsafe, no safety plans were in place to manage the risks. That is concerning. Are those risks and concerns addressed? It is a key concern that children are going missing who are potentially being trafficked, and being trafficked for sexual exploitation as well, which is deeply concerning. Not to extend the conversation, but are those key concerns now being addressed in processes?</p>

          <p eId="para_838">When any of those HIQA reports bring a concern to us, it is about immediate implementation of the actions that are required to mitigate risk. In that case, and Mr. Hone can speak to this, HIQA has accepted our compliance plan and our action plan. That is reported to Mr. Hone in terms of compliance. It is a new service. It is a service that is going to take us a little longer to get to the standard we would want. Some of that is about that supply of professionally qualified social workers. It is not about the resourcing or the money but the supply of them to be able to undertake those duties.</p>

          <p eId="para_839">Ultimately, we want to integrate it into our mainstream services but because it is so new at the moment, we have to develop the expertise and the skills within it because of the particular nuances of that service. We are building capacity, safety and protection within it as we go.</p>
          <p eId="para_840"> It is also worth stating that the vast majority of the young people who present here are doing extremely well. They are out there engaged in education and in local communities and are doing extremely well. I do not know whether this was said, but private providers actually prefer to care for that cohort because they present less complex behaviours a lot of the time. They are doing well, they are here and they want to go to school and to get work. They want that. The vast majority do very well when they come to Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_841">I thank everyone within Tusla for the work they do. It is challenging for everybody. Whether they are social workers or care workers, everyone has the same core objective for some of the most vulnerable within our State. It is critical that the public can trust social services. We need that and there is a need to demonstrate it. Hopefully, today's hearing will go some of the way towards that.</p>
          <p eId="para_842"> I thank the witnesses for coming. That concludes our engagement with Tusla, the Child and Family Agency. I thank Ms Kate Duggan and her officials for attending. I also thank Ms Lara Hynes and Mr. Andrew Patterson from the Department of Children, Disability and Equality for attending.</p>
          <p eId="para_843"> Is it agreed that the clerk seeks any follow-up information and carries out agreed actions arising from the meeting? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_844"> We stand adjourned until 9.30 a.m. on Thursday, 9 October 2025, when we will meet with representatives from Beaumont Hospital, to discuss the its financial statements for 2023, and from the National Treatment Purchase Fund, to discuss its financial statements for 2024.</p>

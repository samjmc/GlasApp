          <p eId="para_11">I welcome everyone to today's meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts. Before we proceed, I will go through a few housekeeping matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_12"> Members are reminded of the provision within Standing Order 226 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_13"> Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> I also remind members of the constitutional requirement that, in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex. Members of the committee attending remotely must do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.</p>
          <p eId="para_15"> Today's agenda is to discuss the minutes, accounts and statements and correspondence, as well as to confirm upcoming meetings. We will then suspend the meeting and begin our engagement with officials from Inland Fisheries Ireland. The minutes of the meeting of 27 November 2025 were agreed by the committee and will be published on the committee's website.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> Three sets of accounts and financial statements were laid between 24 and 28 November 2025 and are due to be considered today. We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, who is a permanent witness to the committee. I ask him to address these accounts and financial statements before I open the floor to members.</p>

          <p eId="para_17">The financial statements of Kilkenny and Carlow Education and Training Board for 2024 received a clear audit opinion.</p>
          <p eId="para_18"> The financial statements of Cork Education and Training Board for 2024 received a clear audit opinion but I drew attention to a material level of non-compliance with procurement rules.</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> The financial statements of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment for 2024 received a clear audit opinion.</p>

          <p eId="para_20">I thank Mr. McCarthy. Do members wish to comment on any of those? No. Can we agree to note the listing of accounts and financial statements? Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_21"> We will now move on to correspondence and will consider B items of correspondence, which have been received from Accounting Officers and Government bodies between 20 and 26 November 2025. The first item, No. R0368, is correspondence received from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, dated 21 November 2025, regarding the marine agencies' annual report 2024. It was agreed to note and publish this item.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> Next is No. R0371, which is correspondence received from the Department of Justice, Home Affairs and Migration, dated 25 November 2025 providing a response to information requested at the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts on 23 November. We discussed this item last week. It was flagged again for discussion in our private session. Does Deputy Geoghegan wish to comment on this?</p>

          <p eId="para_23">We agreed that we would seek further information. There is further information even today about this whole issue, which came to the fore when Tusla was before the committee. What seems to have been published today is another risk, that is, children who are in adult accommodation, of whom there are more than 200 according to reports today. The issue we have discussed is the risk of adults being in children's centres. On both sides of this equation, there are serious safeguarding issues. When the Department of justice was before the committee, its representatives were clear that all this was the responsibility of Tusla but in its correspondence, it has indicated that in fact, the legal responsibility is vested in the Department and as there are changes in law, it will go back to being them. However, there are huge issues as this impasse continues between two State agencies that poses real safeguarding challenges that Tusla is clearly highly concerned about and further adverse consequences could arise from that. We need to get the Department of justice to respond to that adequately and perhaps engage with Tusla again on this issue.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnBrady" eId="spk_5">
          <from> An Cathaoirleach<recordedTime time="2025-12-04T10:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_24">I concur with all that. We had a discussion about it in our private session. It is quite concerning. Even the information the Deputy alluded to, which came out overnight, involves 200 children. Our primary concern is the welfare of all children in State care. We have a remit in respect of finance and moneys but also about who has responsibility and there seems to be some ambiguity on the part of the Department and of Tusla. We have agreed to follow up on the response we got and on foot of the new information that has come to light. It is agreed we will write to the Department to follow up on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> It was also agreed on foot of the correspondence we received from the Department in which it gave a figure of €400,000 for what was IPAS accommodation in Newtown Mount Kennedy in my constituency of Wicklow. Some €400,000 was spent on preparing and using the site in Newtown Mount Kennedy over a ten-month period. It ceased to be used for accommodation in December last year. In a meeting with the Department of justice, I asked for a specific breakdown because since that time, security has remained on site to protect an unused and unoccupied site at a considerable cost, I imagine. As the Department has stated it has no intention of further developing or using the site, I asked for a breakdown of the ongoing security costs. That was not furnished so it was agreed to write to the Department again to seek a breakdown of the security costs for an unused, unoccupied site. That was agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> We will move on to our work programme. Next week, on Thursday, 11 December 2025, the committee will meet the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. On Thursday, 18 December 2025, the committee will meet the Department of Social Protection and we will next week have a further discussion about our work programme for the new year.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> We will move on to any other business. Are there any items members wish to flag? No. That concludes the second session. We will suspend the meeting for approximately five minutes to bring in our witnesses.</p>

          <p eId="para_28">This morning we will engage with Inland Fisheries Ireland to examine the 2023 financial statements. The committee will also examine the Comptroller and Auditor General’s Special Report 118 – Governance Internal Control and Value for Money Issues in Inland Fisheries Ireland. We are joined by the following officials from Inland Fisheries Ireland: Mr. Barry Fox, deputy chief executive officer, Ms Suzanne Campion, head of finance and corporate services, Dr. Fiona Kelly, head of research, policy and risk, Mr. Milton Matthews, acting head of operations, and Mr. Michael Cusack, field services manager. We are also joined by an official from the Department of Climate, Energy and the Environment who is here in a representative capacity, namely, Ms Martina Hennessy, assistant secretary general. Finally, we are joined by officials from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General: the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, who is a permanent witness to the committee and Ms Ruth Foley, deputy director of audit. They are all very welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege, and the practice of the Houses as regards reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence. The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege. This means that they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting. However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege, and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that this privilege is not abused. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_30"> Witnesses are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that you should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity, by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> I now call on the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, for his opening statement.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_7">
          <from> Mr. Seamus McCarthy<recordedTime time="2025-12-04T10:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_32">As members are aware, the remit of Inland Fisheries Ireland is to protect, manage and conserve Ireland’s inland fisheries and sea-angling resources. IFI’s income in 2023 amounted to €40.5 million. More than 90% of its income comes from State funding sources. Most of the remaining income is derived from fee income for permits, licences and fishery rates.</p>
          <p eId="para_33"> IFI’s expenditure in 2023 amounted to €41.2 million. More than 70% of the expenditure, or €29.3 million, was in respect of remuneration and other pay and pension costs. Some €9.9 million was spent on field operations, with €2.3 million spent on administration expenses.</p>
          <p eId="para_34"> I certified the 2023 financial statements on 13 December 2024 and issued a clear audit opinion. However, I drew attention in my audit report to issues of concern regarding IFI’s governance arrangements and the adequacy of its internal control systems that are dealt with in more detail in the special report that is before the committee this morning. I had drawn attention to some of the same concerns in my reports on the 2022 and 2021 audits, and because the matters remained ongoing, I felt a more in-depth examination was required.</p>
          <p eId="para_35"> The board of a State agency is the principal decision-making body in relation to the organisation’s strategic direction and oversees the performance of its operations. It is also responsible for ensuring the safeguarding of the assets it controls and compliance with governance norms. The chairperson of the IFI board resigned in April 2022. A new chairperson was appointed in May 2022 but resigned in January 2023. A further four resignations from the board occurred during 2022 and in January 2023. As a result, the board effectively became unable to reach the required quorum to meet and to make decisions, including approval of the annual financial statements.</p>
          <p eId="para_36"> In February 2023, the remaining board members were stood down by the then Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications on a no-fault basis. Using statutory provisions in the relevant legislation, the Minister appointed two persons on a temporary basis to perform the functions of IFI. As well as day-to-day oversight, they commissioned an independent review of IFI’s governance, which resulted in a December 2023 report setting out recommendations for change. A new board commenced operations in January 2024.</p>
          <p eId="para_37"> The main reason IFI exists is to secure the protection and conservation of fisheries resources, including both fish stocks and their habitats. IFI’s capacity to achieve this through active patrolling on Irish waters diminished in 2019, when the number of staff qualified to lead such patrols dropped sharply due to a decrease in the number of staff trained to the required standard along with the retirement and departure of trained staff from the organisation. IFI’s capacity to undertake patrolling was gradually restored through training of additional personnel, and the fleet of 12 patrol boats was replaced at a cost of €3.5 million. By 2023, IFI was achieving around 81% of its target of 25 patrols per boat per year.</p>
          <p eId="para_38"> IFI has the power to initiate prosecutions for serious fisheries and environmental offences, including fish kills and water pollution. However, in March 2023, it discovered that formal delegated authority from the board allowing its officers to initiate these prosecutions was not in place. Because of that gap, IFI had to withdraw many live prosecution cases. This had a significant impact on IFI’s ability to carry out its protection role and created a risk of financial loss and additional legal costs for the organisation. Prosecutions recommenced in June 2023 when formal delegated sanction was put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_39"> Between 2019 and 2021, IFI received around €1.2 million from the Dormant Accounts Fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_40">There were weaknesses in how IFI managed this funding. Internal audit reviews commissioned by the board showed that, in some cases, it was not clear that the spending fully matched the purpose of the funding. As a result, IFI repaid over €28,000 to its parent Department in 2022.</p>
          <p eId="para_41"> IFI owns a substantial period property called Aasleagh Lodge adjacent to the Erriff river in County Mayo. The grounds of the lodge encompass two self-catering cottages and an IFI operations base, which limits the income potential of the property. Over several years, there were significant deficiencies in control over the letting and management of the lodge and cottages. This exposed IFI to unnecessary financial risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_42"> Between November 2021 and February 2023, the then CEO's work base was changed from IFI's headquarters at Citywest to the regional offices in Ballyshannon, County Donegal. There is no evidence that a proper analysis was carried out or a formal business case prepared to support this change, or that the change was properly authorised. During that period, the CEO received over €7,900 in subsistence expenses due to the change, of which €1,000 was repaid to IFI after the change was reversed.</p>
          <p eId="para_43"> The work carried out by IFI staff is mostly field based, with a range of vehicles needed to perform its statutory functions. Notwithstanding this, the vehicle fleet operated by IFI appears to have been excessive in scale when compared to the number of staff. There were also benefit-in-kind tax issues in respect of vehicles used by IFI staff, resulting in settlements with the Revenue Commissioners totalling around €296,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_44"> In addition, an administrative error in July 2021 led to some of IFI's vehicle fleet being uninsured for a period. This only came to light when one of the vehicles was involved in a road traffic accident. The direct costs incurred by IFI in relation to the road traffic accident totalled almost €230,000 by the end of 2023.</p>
          <p eId="para_45"> Taken together, the many issues raised in the report indicate the development of an inadequate and inappropriate system of control, which seriously undermines public confidence in IFI's ability to carry out the important functions with which it is charged. The findings from the audit by my office of the draft 2024 financial statements are currently being reviewed. I expect to complete the audit by the end of the year.</p>

          <p eId="para_46">I thank Mr. McCarthy. I now ask the deputy chief executive officer to give the opening statement on behalf of Inland Fisheries Ireland. As set out in the letter of invitation, he has five minutes to make his opening statement.</p>

          <from> Mr. Barry Fox<recordedTime time="2025-12-04T10:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_47">Gabhaim buíochas leis an gCathaoirleach agus leis an gcoiste ar an ócáid seo and for the opportunity to appear before the committee today to discuss the Comptroller and Auditor General's Special Report 118 and the financial statements for 2023.</p>
          <p eId="para_48"> We are pleased to discuss our work, the challenges we have faced, and the new opportunities ahead, as Inland Fisheries Ireland looks to the future with confidence. I am the deputy chief executive of IFI, serving in this role on an interim basis. The recruitment process for a chief executive is currently under way through the Public Appointments Service. I am joined by supporting witnesses, Ms Suzanne Campion, head of finance and corporate services; Dr. Milton Matthews, acting head of operations; Dr. Fiona Kelly, head of research, policy and risk; and Mr. Michael Cusack, field services manager.</p>
          <p eId="para_49"> I acknowledge at the outset the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, which highlighted a number of governance and control weaknesses within the organisation, the regularity of certain transactions and value-for-money issues. Inland Fisheries Ireland fully accepts the findings of this report, and we recognise the importance of addressing these shortcomings comprehensively and transparently.</p>
          <p eId="para_50"> In February 2023, under section 20(5) of the Inland Fisheries Act 2010, the then Minister, Eamon Ryan, removed the IFI board on a no-fault basis, following a series of resignations that had left it unable to function effectively. The Minister subsequently appointed Mr. Seamus Neely and Mr. Tom Barry under section 18 of the Act to perform the functions of IFI during the period in which a new board was being appointed. Their professionalism, independence and applied expertise significantly strengthened accountability, accelerated the pace of reform and stabilised organisational governance. During their term, a comprehensive independent governance review was commissioned. A key development in progressing governance reform was the appointment of a new board of Inland Fisheries Ireland in January 2024. This board brings substantial expertise in governance, environmental management, finance and public administration. Its oversight, strategic direction and commitment to the highest standards of public sector governance, along with extremely hard-working and dedicated staff, have been central to driving organisational renewal.</p>
          <p eId="para_51"> The governance review, completed by Ernst &amp; Young, provided a detailed examination of governance structures, organisational culture and operational processes, and presented a clear blueprint for reform. The executive has acted swiftly and decisively on its recommendations, with robust oversight provided by the new board.</p>
          <p eId="para_52"> IFI has published its governance assurance framework, which demonstrates the strengthened internal controls, clarified governance roles and responsibilities, improved risk management and compliance frameworks, and enhanced oversight across the organisation. Updated procedures, revised governance documentation and clearer reporting lines are now firmly in place, supporting robust, transparent and accountable decision-making.</p>
          <p eId="para_53"> Inland Fisheries Ireland safeguards one of the State's most valuable natural assets: the network of rivers, streams, lakes, and coastal ecosystems that support fish populations, biodiversity and healthy aquatic communities. As the national agency with statutory responsibility for the protection, development and management of these resources, we operate within a comprehensive legislative framework.</p>
          <p eId="para_54"> The organisation continues to deliver a high-quality public service in fulfilling its statutory mandate. IFI has statutory responsibility for Ireland's 74,000 km of rivers and streams and 128,000 ha of lakes and exercises patrol jurisdiction along the coastline out to 12 nautical miles from the baselines. The scale and geographical breadth of our remit is extensive. IFI's dedicated staff work professionally and diligently to protect, conserve and manage Ireland's freshwater species and their habitats in an increasingly unpredictable and rapidly changing environmental landscape.</p>
          <p eId="para_55"> It is important to note that while IFI is a high-performing organisation, our ability to fully realise our ambitions has been constrained for many years by limited financial and human resources and updating of our statutory powers.</p>
          <p eId="para_56"> IFI is pleased to lead the National Barrier Mitigation Programme, NBMP, 2024–2027, funded by the Department of housing and the Department of the environment. A total of €100 million has been approved to remove or mitigate river barriers affecting species such as Atlantic salmon, European eel and lamprey. The programme aims to address 257 barriers over its lifetime, with planning and environmental consents central to delivery. The NBMP is addressing a key commitment in the Government's Water Action Plan 2024 and aligns with the EU water framework directive, the EU biodiversity strategy for 2030 and the emerging nature restoration regulation. IFI will invest €14 million in the first 103 projects nationwide, with agreements now being issued.</p>
          <p eId="para_57"> The withdrawal of prosecution cases underscored the need for consistent adherence to governance, oversight and stronger internal checks. It also highlighted the requirement for clearly defined authority structures, properly recorded decision-making and stronger governance documentation. The organisation took decisive action to resolve this issue. I can provide assurance to the committee that these processes are now in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_58"> In relation to Aasleagh Lodge and cottages, IFI has consistently sought to identify and pursue solutions that maximise the return to the taxpayer from this unique State asset. We are satisfied that the board was kept fully informed of all expenditure associated with the complex. A board resolution has now been agreed to proceed with the sale of Aasleagh cottages. In line with this decision and following the required work to split the folio and provide separate services for the cottages, we expect the disposal process to be completed by the end of 2026. Concurrently, IFI intends to upgrade and repurpose Aasleagh Lodge to deliver enhanced public value. The proposed development includes the establishment of an international research hub for the national salmonid index catchment on the River Erriff, the provision of office accommodation and the creation of a training and education centre for IFI.</p>
          <p eId="para_59"> Aquatic environments are increasingly threatened by pollution, nutrient enrichment, biodiversity loss, climate change and invasive species. The spread of invasives remains a serious national concern, and without stronger legislation, adequate resources and co-ordinated enforcement, the long-term ecological and economic impacts will be significant. IFI has first-hand experience of this challenge through its long-term management of Lagarosiphon major on Lough Corrib. At the same time, IFI is actively restoring freshwater habitats by reconnecting rivers, improving spawning streams, removing migration barriers and restoring natural channel processes to build ecosystem resilience. Yet, despite these efforts, key native species continue to decline. The European eel is now critically endangered and wild salmon returns have fallen from 1.76 million in 1975 to a provisional 153,460 in 2025, a catastrophic collapse within one generation. These trends highlight the urgency of IFI's restoration and protection work and the need for strengthened cross-government action.</p>
          <p eId="para_60"> Looking ahead, our new statement of strategy for the period 2026 to 2030 sets a clear direction for the organisation and reflects our development into an agile, outward-looking and evidence-based fisheries environmental agency. We are operating in a period of significant ecological pressure. Climate impacts are accelerating, water quality is declining in many catchments and native fish species are increasingly vulnerable. These challenges reinforce the need for us to adapt quickly, strengthen our environmental leadership role and adopt more integrated and technology-enabled approaches across our remit.</p>
          <p eId="para_61"> Our team will address the committee’s questions, and we will share with members any written information they request thereafter. I thank the Chair and the committee for their attention this morning.</p>

          <p eId="para_130">These vessels were originally bought for salmon protection activity. Our area of responsibility has expanded into bluefin tuna and sea bass. We are also going to have new duties, potentially in 2026, which will extend our area of responsibility to the entire marine zone right around the coast. Therefore, I would say that we do need these boats. Salmon protection is still an issue in many areas around the coast, and these boats are an essential tool in deterring people from illegal activity.</p>

          <p eId="para_134">That is when these boats are utilised. It is during the salmon window. When the Atlantic salmon reach our shores, these boats come into operation to protect the salmon while they are off the coast. One of the drawbacks we have with these boats is that it is like seeing a fire engine going down the road. The minute these boats are hitched up to a trailer and taken out onto the public highway, word gets around the coastal areas very quickly that we are on route. Therefore, we tend to deploy them as a deterrent and as a kind of rapid response in certain covert situations in which we use them. However, we have other tools we use. We are now using deploying jet skis-----</p>

          <p eId="para_273">Yes. Some €20,000 of the dormant accounts funding that was being progressed at that stage was for the marketing and development of packs for new entrants to angling. The sum of €50,000 was split between the National Coarse Fishing Federation of Ireland, NCFFI, and the Angling Council of Ireland. The National Coarse Fishing Federation took up the funding of approximately €19,000 and the Angling Council of Ireland did not. It is on record at the previous hearing of the Committee of Public Accounts.

          <p eId="para_278">There was a service level agreement, of which I have a copy. It was not followed through and then the distribution process moved from an SLA to an etender process. Despite the SLA being for a value of €70,000, the etender process for the distribution of this fund of €70,000 that was earmarked by the Minister of State only advertised for €50,000. There seems to be a discrepancy not only between the Minister of State making the announcement to one club – that is a different issue for the Minister of State to account for – but in the total amount that was agreed in the SLA and what was available later on in the etender.</p>

          <p eId="para_280">The announcement made by the Minister of State said that IFI works with AFYDI, ACI and other organisations. The award to IFI at the time was for €20,000 and €50,000. The sum of €20,000 was for a national angling strategy and €50,000 for novice angler activation.</p>
          <p eId="para_281"> The SLA the Deputy mentioned was in discussion with the ACI previous to all of that but it was never signed off or agreed upon. The €70,000 from the Dormant Accounts Fund is a completely separate issue. Of that, €20,000 went to the angling strategy and it was decided by the board and the Minister at the time that the €50,000 would be distributed in a fair manner through the etenders process.</p>

          <p eId="para_294"> I am tight on time but in my last couple of minutes of this round I would like to raise some local issues pertaining to where I come from. There are concerns about the fish count on the River Boyne being inaccurate. The counters are placed at Blackcastle in Navan, County Meath, where the river is quite wide. Is there a case to move the counters to a narrower part of the River Boyne to the ensure accuracy of the fish count? Is Mr. Fox concerned about that in any way?</p>

          <from> Mr. Barry Fox<recordedTime time="2025-12-04T11:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_295">No, I am not concerned about it. For us to establish a new fish counter on the Boyne would involve us putting in a crump weir or something similar in the river, which would impede protected species from migrating through the river, so it is not a policy I would advise pursuing.</p>
          <p eId="para_296"> To put it in context, in particular around salmon, our national conservation limit for salmon is 258,414. We are now sitting at 155,000, so while some rivers still have surpluses, most of the rivers in the State are under the conservation limit. There are a lot of issues around the management advice for 2026, but it needs to be taken in the context that salmon are in rapid decline. There are a lot of reasons for that. We do not blame anglers or commercial fishermen, but we have to take action to try to arrest the decline and that is what we are trying to do. Unfortunately, the Boyne is well below its conservation limit. There are merger issues in the Boyne. Some 53% of it is arterially drained, so production is lower than it should be for a catchment of that size. In recent years, we have been making significant investment in the Boyne to restore the habitats in the river. Hopefully, in the coming years we will see a reverse in the decline and an increase in fish.</p>

          <p eId="para_297">The annual report states that in June 2023 there was illegal net fishing in the River Boyne Estuary at Baltray. Somebody was caught and fined for that. Have there been more instances of illegal net fishing going on in the river since then? Could Mr. Fox briefly comment on whether he sees a time when licensed draft net fishermen will be allowed to operate on the river or other rivers that they traditionally fished, or are those days gone?</p>

          <p eId="para_298">They are certainly reducing for a number of geographical areas around the country. There are potentially seven areas where the commercial draft net fishing licences will be removed in 2026 if the Minister accepts the advice. The view at the time when the high seas drift-net fishing was removed was that there had to be an equal share of the stock between the commercial fishermen and the recreational anglers. If we move to a position where there are surplus stocks above the conservation limits in any catchment in the country, we would have look at how it would be shared out again in the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_306"> I wish to focus on the uninsured vehicles. Following a road traffic accident in August 2021, the IFI discovered that 15 hired vehicles, including the vehicle involved in the accident, had been uninsured for a period. All the uninsured vehicles had been hired between 1 June and 27 July 2021. The IFI subsequently changed its insurance arrangements so that its vehicles no longer have to be insured on an individual basis. With the vehicle that was involved in the crash in Donegal, An Garda Síochána would have been involved. I have another "Yes" or "No" question. Was there any false documentation provided to An Garda Síochána in relation to this?</p>

          <p eId="para_351">That does not make any sense. There was an external investigation commissioned by the former Minister, Eamon Ryan, in relation to information that he had received regarding false documentation provided to An Garda Síochána in relation to an uninsured vehicle. Those findings were produced to the Garda Commissioner and the board of the IFI at the beginning of 2025 and Mr. Fox, as the head of the IFI, is unaware of those findings. </p>

          <p eId="para_353">That is unbelievable. The IFI allowed a staff member to receive a summons in relation to an uninsured vehicle. It received official confirmation on 16 November 2021 that the car was uninsured. Despite the former CEO, Francis O'Donnell, notifying the public accounts committee on 6 July 2023 that he knew on the day of the accident that the vehicle was uninsured, the member of staff received a summons after 16 November 2021. The fact of the matter is that the IFI did not produce that documentation to An Garda Síochána or the staff member. The witnesses are now saying that they did not understand that there was a legal obligation. Of course, there is a legal obligation. False documentation was provided to the staff member who then in turn provided it to An Garda Síochána. What we ultimately have now is a staff member of the IFI - reading between the lines - being thrown under the bus for this. </p>

          <p eId="para_359">That external investigation, where the findings were given to the board of the IFI, speaks wonders to me. It showcases the culture within the IFI that it has not brought that to Mr. Fox's attention and that it is not following up on an external investigation commissioned by the former Minister. </p>
          <p eId="para_360">Those results and findings would have been given to Mr. Fox by the new Minister. The fact of the matter is that those findings are now on the desk of the Garda Commissioner. At the same time, the ex-CEO resigned as soon as those findings were given. I will not read between the lines because I do not want to make any allegations, but I am certain - I would have expected an answer on this today - that within those findings, there is evidence of this staff member being absolutely thrown under the bus by the IFI.</p>

          <p eId="para_364">No, Mr. Fox cannot, because it was the case. The IFI was officially informed on 16 November 2021 that the car was uninsured. It chose not to inform that member of staff or An Garda Síochána, and allowed that staff member to receive two summonses, one for dangerous driving, which is before the courts, so I will not mention it again, and the second for the uninsured vehicle. The IFI chose a year later to inform that staff member. That is a matter of fact.</p>

          <p eId="para_365">I will take that in two parts. The first part is that I expect - I could be wrong on this - that the investigation undertaken by the Department was a PD, so that is not something that IFI would have been made aware of. On the second part of it, I will go and look at the file. I will try to get as much information as I can, but in relation to the issue-----</p>

          <p eId="para_366">What I want Mr. Fox to do is to go back to the board and say, “I am the head of the IFI. Why was I not informed at the start of this year that the findings from the external investigation were produced by the Department?” That is what I would say. If Mr. Fox wants to create a culture of proper governance, he needs to be leading this organisation properly. What I certainly believe, because I know from experience on this, and Mr. Fox knows that I know from experience, because I am a Mallow man and I know about the revelations that are ongoing within the IFI, is that this needs to be absolutely built up once again from the ground up because the IFI is an organisation that is distrusted by the public. Hopefully, I will have a second opportunity to come in.</p>

Initially, he said he did not know anything about the summonses or about the information. Why is he now asserting that point? Mr. Fox then went on to say that he can “guarantee”. He was very firm, even though he did not know anything about this. There are contradictory things happening in real time here. I want to understand why the piece of paper was handed to Ms Campion.

          <p eId="para_447">I note from Mr. Fox's opening statement that there has been a catastrophic collapse in the salmon yields and salmon returns. There has been a catastrophic collapse in the public's trust in this organisation over the past three years. Mr. Fox also said that the organisation has been constrained for many years by limited financial resources. It is very hard to marry that type of statement with so many examples of the misuse of public funds. It is very hard to see how there have been constraints placed on an organisation that in many circumstances misspent or misappropriated funds in the way that IFI did.</p>
          <p eId="para_448"> I am going to first focus on some of the rulings from the WRC. The C and AG report refers to an unfair dismissal at a cost of €38,500 plus legal fees of €38,000. The WRC report stated that the employee was targeted from the beginning and that the CEO attempted to surreptitiously influence the adjudicator by attempting to speak to him off record. The WRC also stated that it could see no reason for the suspension and that it seemed that the employee was to be taken out by hook or by crook. How long did that employee work for IFI?</p>

          <p eId="para_527">Yes. There is a long history to this, as the Deputy has probably seen through the various sets of accounts. The IFI used to manage Aasleagh Lodge and cottages as bed and breakfast accommodation, for which it took rental income. In 2015 the board made the decision to no longer operate them itself and to lease them out. A commercial bidder won the tender and took over the lodge but gave it up after a year because they were not making money. It was subsequently offered to all staff, pending sale in 2017. An agreement was put in place at that stage which was thought would be finished very soon when the building was sold but it actually ran on to 2021. </p>

          <p eId="para_529">No. As I understand it, the lease agreement had a ten-week notice clause in it, so it could be pulled at any stage. That was part of the idea of having it there on a short-term basis, so that it could be relinquished very quickly.</p>

          <p eId="para_580">Okay. Mr. Fox might come back to me in writing because I do not think IFI can say it will review it and then not reclaim the money. I am putting it to him now that that money should be recouped, purely out of principal, because at the end of the day there are good travel allowances and good subsistence in place for people to be supported, and there are work vehicles and everything. However, we cannot allow somebody to abuse it - we all have knowledge of the abuse - and then let them away with it. We need that bit of accountability from IFI. That is a way for IFI as well to show this committee it is serious about this and that it wants to get it resolved. Were any disciplinary or governance processes undertaken in response to that behaviour?</p>

          <p eId="para_586">The decision to remove the board members was taken in the round with all the issues that were going on at the time. It was determined that it would be more effective to remove the board, put interim appointees in place and then appoint a new board.</p>

          <p eId="para_588">No, the senior counsel review, which finished in July 2022, made no suggestion that the board was ineffective at that point.

          <p eId="para_589">Surely if the remaining board members were not ineffective, it would have made more sense just to appoint however many board members were needed. Iit is good to have rotation on a board, but it is also good to have a working knowledge of the organisation. Why was the decision taken to remove them?</p>

          <p eId="para_590">I do not know why the Minister made that decision, but what I could suggest is that it relates to the appointment process. People have to go through a State board appointment process. That would have taken time, which would have meant the board for that period of time - it can take up to six months - would not have had a quorum.</p>

          <p eId="para_591">Okay. Sometimes, there are people on boards who are trying to do good and figure out what is happening in an organisation to accelerate it. Then, these members were removed, which does not really make sense. They could have been left there. They had working knowledge of the issues. They were trying to work through them, obviously, because they were not removed until February 2023. It just looked like it was a case of clearing the house, and we will go again. Sometimes that can be acceptable, but I just do not understand the rationale behind that. </p>

          <p eId="para_594"> I am conscious of my time. I want to go back to those systemic governance failures around the expenses. I know it is only a small amount of money, but if we can get the basics right in any organisation, everything else will flourish from there.

          <p eId="para_595">What we were trying to do with the report was to pull all this together. There is obviously a considerable amount of work that has been done by IFI itself and by the section 18 appointees and the new board. There are internal audits and so on. There is a huge amount of learning there. We would be looking to see that all of those actions that are identified are being followed up. With each audit that goes on, we would be looking to see that the current board is overseeing the implementation of all that action.</p>

          <p eId="para_597">That depends on the circumstances. I decided that this had affected at least two sets of financial statements. There would have been maybe management letter points even before that.

The question is, having acknowledged good work being done now at this level, whether they will get through to the next round and, hopefully, not come back. It is worth reflecting on because the Chairman and I sat on the previous Committee of Public Accounts. There was significant discussion on the record at the committee with regard to the previous board, the chief executive and the issues. When we go through them, they were incredibly significant issues around dormant accounts funding, particular properties such as Ashleigh and the CEO's expenses. What an organisation wants to do is come into the Committee of Public Accounts and establish confidence in the organisation and the public money that is being allocated to it. I hope we do that today.</p>
          <p eId="para_602"> I want to reflect on some of the board issues because some board members were not present at the previous Committee of Public Account meetings. There was a particular discussion. Deputy Dolan has asked about the approval of the change of base for the CEO.</p>

There was inevitably a disagreement here between the board and the CEO. That is where issues always grind into difficulty. Deputy Dolan touched on it as well. On the reason for dismissing the board on a no-fault basis, many people who are involved in public life come forward to serve on these boards and I imagine it was a very unsatisfactory way for those board members to finish their time with IFI.

          <p eId="para_621">It was a structural response. I will come back to that point. They were dismissed on a no-fault basis. I have some sympathy for people who step forward to serve in a position where there is a disagreement with a CEO, who is often in a full-time position and has the capacity of the organisation and so on, not specifically in this case but in general, where directors are sometimes left vulnerable. I will leave it at that.</p>

          <p eId="para_624">There were significant concerns about the overheads which were attached to that. Six members of staff were appointed.

          <p eId="para_631">The Maugherow Sea Angling Club was funded through the governing body, the Angling Council of Ireland, ACI. It was out of process with the policy for funding at the time. However, very quickly after that, the club got its own bank account and had its constitution in place. I was with it two weeks ago and confirmed that all the equipment is still in use. The club is active and is interested in doing some youth angling development work with us in 2026.</p>

          <p eId="para_635">We have a number of staff who do a lot of foreign travel. When people go to such places as the USA for angling promotion events and so on, it would be a significant burden on them to have to spend their own money. They have use of a credit card therefore to hire a car, book accommodation and such things, if it cannot be done through the purchase order, PO, system. However, every cent spent on a credit card goes through the purchase order system. It is not a matter of people just walking in and tapping the card. There is back-up paperwork for that spending.</p>

          <p eId="para_750">Salmon stocks have been in dramatic decline since the 1970s. IFI is doing everything it can to control the freshwater environment. There is a lot more to be done. There is a lot of restoration work to be done at scale in the country. There is a lot more work to be done with other agencies on trying to deal with other pressures that are on salmon numbers and a number of other fish species. The big issue, without question, is water quality. That is a matter on which we have to work with other organisations.</p>

          <p eId="para_923">Two pieces from the code of conduct for IFI staff state that it is the policy of the IFI to comply with all relevant statutory and regulatory requirements governing its operations. If anyone other than the staff member is involved in a road traffic accident, they must show their insurance certificate to local gardaí within 24 hours. The IFI was made aware on 16 November 2021 that the insurance documentation that he provided within that 24-hour period was inaccurate and the IFI failed to tell him and to tell An Garda Síochána. The board is now refuting that and does not have a leg to stand on. An external investigation took place from former Minister Eamon Ryan's office. The external investigation basically said that the IFI knowingly allowed this to happen. It did, because on 16 November, three months after the crash, it officially knew and still failed to tell An Garda Síochána or the employee.</p>

The Department has made a clear finding against Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI. The IFI board has said it does not like that finding and has written back to the Department. How is that the end of the matter? Maybe the Department can assist me here. If a Department appoints an external investigator and makes a very clear finding following that protected disclosure against the entity being investigated, what is the consequence for the entity being investigated if it refutes that finding?</p>

          <p eId="para_1063">Is it a breach of the organisation's policy to ask staff members to mind other staff members' children, staff who are not vetted and who are not safe against any allegations? This is a legitimate question. I will tell Mr. Fox the relevance of it. It is because we have seen a series of areas that have not gotten enough attention in terms of management, governance and oversight . We have seen areas that are extremely questionable with regard to judgment. You are saying this request did not come from you and that it came from the former director of operations. Did they not double check with you before your son left?</p>

          <p eId="para_1171"> I want to turn to a final issue, that is, algae blooms and the impact they have on lakes across the State. The situation in Lough Neagh in the North has been widely aired; that environmental disaster that has unfolded up there. That was ten years in the making and there were systemic failures to address many of the warning signs over the previous ten years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1172"> In my constituency of Wicklow, a number of lakes, including Blessington and Vartry, are hugely important lakes because they provide water not just for Wicklow but also large areas within Dublin. Two of those lakes have had what I can only describe as fairly considerable and serious algae blooms over the past number of years. What role or responsibility does IFI have in the monitoring of algae blooms? What preventative action has been taken or is being taken, and not just in terms of those two, because I know there are other very serious areas of concern also?</p>

          <p eId="para_1181">In terms of IFI's remit, it is obviously to protect the environment or fish. Do the witnesses think its remit should include the monitoring and protection of our lakes?

Do our witnesses think that remit is expansive enough to address what is a growing and very serious issue of concern?</p>

          <p eId="para_1182">We have quite a narrow role in regards to water quality enforcement, and we are working with the Department to expand that. We have put a number of recommendations to the Department as to what we would like to progress. The Cathaoirleach is right. To answer his question, there is an opportunity for us to be more involved. The monitoring and classification of water bodies, however, will remain a matter for the EPA.</p>

          <p eId="para_1183">I have one concluding question and it relates to a fish kill on the Aughrim river, again in Wicklow. It was July of last year, in 2024, when there was a fairly considerable kill of fish. Were any prosecutions taken as a result of that? Do we know the cause of that particular fish kill?</p>

          <p eId="para_1184">Yes. It was a wood treatment facility on the banks of the Aughrim river. I actually visited that fish kill as the head of operations at the time. That is a perfect example of where the IFI cannot prosecute. We were pretty certain of where the discharge came from, because white diffuse came down through the river bank and because it was highly toxic, it killed a significant amount of fish in a stretch. On further investigation with the EPA, the facility owners confirmed they had a discharge from that location in breach of their EPA licence. The EPA took the prosecution with the support of the IFI.</p>

          <p eId="para_1188">It occurred within its licensed site. It was authorised to take that prosecution because IFI could not detect a discharge. We have to find a live discharge or be able to tie that discharge right back to the pipe that it comes out of. Without that evidence we will not be able to progress to a successful outcome.</p>

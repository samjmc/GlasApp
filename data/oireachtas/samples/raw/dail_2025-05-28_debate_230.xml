          <p eId="para_15">No apologies have been received for today's meeting. I advise members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings. I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement. Therefore, a member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting. In this regard, I will ask any member partaking via Microsoft Teams that, prior to making their contribution to the meeting, they confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House complex. </p>
          <p eId="para_16"> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory with regard to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction. </p>
          <p eId="para_17"> The first item of today's business is the nomination for Leas-Chathaoirleach. As agreed at the first meeting, of the committee one expression of interest for the position of Leas-Chathaoirleach was received, that being Deputy Brian Brennan. I now invite a formal nomination for Deputy Brian Brennan as Leas-Chathaoirleach. Deputies Clendennen and McCormack have nominated Deputy Brian Brennan.</p>
          <p eId="para_18"> I now invite any other nominations for the position of Leas-Chathaoirleach. There are none.</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> We will now consider the nomination in the order it was received, of which this was the only one. I must now put the question, "That Deputy Brian Brennan be elected Leas-Chathaoirleach of this joint committee". Is that agreed? Agreed. I congratulate Deputy Brennan. Would he like to say a few words?</p>

          <p eId="para_20">My colleagues have gone to another vote. I want to put on record that I was disappointed that people were put under so much pressure to get to two votes at the exact same time. It is across parties and I feel it is wrong and disrespectful to the Chair and to the committee we are involved in. </p>
          <p eId="para_21"> I really look forward to giving the Chair some back-up. I am coming from the private sector so am not embedded in politics and I feel that will be useful. Already, I feel that from last week's introductions I will enjoy working with and listening to everyone across all parties. That is where I am coming from. We are going into a very interesting and difficult period. How we manoeuvre ourselves through that will be very interesting. I am looking forward to it and to working with everyone. Everyone right across all parties will get a fair call.</p>

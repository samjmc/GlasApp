          <from> An Cathaoirleach<recordedTime time="2025-05-29T09:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_13">No apologies have been received. Everyone is very welcome. I remind all those in attendance to ensure that their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> Before we proceed, I have a few housekeeping matters to go through. I remind members of the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex. Members of the committee attending remotely must do so from within the precincts of Leinster House. </p>
          <p eId="para_15"> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice and ruling of the Cathaoirleach to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. Members are also reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 226 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies. We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, who is a permanent witness to the committee. He is accompanied by Ms Paula O’Connor, deputy director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> The public business before us is as follows: accounts and financial statements and correspondence. We will then go into private session to examine housekeeping matters. At 10.30 a.m. we will begin our public session to engage with the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, the Arts Council and the National Gallery of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_17"> I would like to announce that Deputy Paul McAuliffe was elected as Leas-Chathaoirleach at the last committee meeting. I congratulate Paul again. </p>
          <p eId="para_18"> No sets of accounts and financial statements were laid between 19 and 23 May 2025.</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> We now move to correspondence, as previously agreed, items that were not flagged for discussion for this meeting will be dealt with in accordance with the proposed actions that have been circulated, and decisions taken by the committee on correspondence are recorded in the minutes of the committee’s meetings and published on the committee’s webpage. </p>
          <p eId="para_20"> The first category under which items have been flagged is category B – correspondence from Accounting Officers or Ministers and follow-up to PAC meetings. The first correspondence is No. R0004B from Ms Madeline Delaney, chief executive, Charities Regulator, dated 13 November 2024, and provides follow-up information requested by the committee at the meeting of 17 October 2024. Deputy Farrelly flagged this item for discussion.</p>

          <p eId="para_21">Could we write to the regulator seeking clarity as to whether there was a capacity review and whether this is the project referred to on page 2 of the report, on which Pobal did a scoping exercise, and whether the committee can get the costs associated with that project? </p>

          <p eId="para_22">Is that agreed? Agreed. It is proposed to note and publish this item and take those follow-up actions. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> No. R0005B is from Mr. Christy Duffy, chief executive, City of Dublin Education and Training Board, dated 14 November 2024, and provides follow-up information requested by the committee on noncompliant procurement. I flagged this item for discussion. There is a continuing issue with ETBs. We have seen similar issues crop up with a number of them. I would like to return to this item during the discussion on our work programme with a suggested course of action for a series of meeting to call in some of the ETBs. I will defer that until we return to the work programme. </p>

          <p eId="para_24">I have no issue with the accounts of the education and training board but they were party to a Department of Education building programme that involved Western Building Systems. The previous committee had written to them. Can we write to the Department of Education and the ETB seeking an update on the site on the Swords Road? </p>

          <p eId="para_25">That is fair enough. Is that agreed? Agreed. It is proposed to note and publish this item. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> No. R0008B is from Ms Bernie McNally, Secretary General, Department of Education, dated 15 November 2024, provides follow-up information requested by the committee on noncompliant procurement. Deputy Farrelly flagged this item for discussion.</p>

          <p eId="para_27">I seek clarification on the extent of noncompliance. Were the projects fully delivered and were any issues raised relating to the contractors, particularly in regard to Version 1, which is on the list quite often? Can we seek clarification from the Department, first, on whether all these projects were fully delivered within budget and then whether there were any issues with the suppliers?</p>

          <p eId="para_29"> No. R0034B is from Mr. Colm O'Reardon, Secretary General, Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science dated 22 November 2024. It provides follow-up information requested by the committee on late submission of accounts for the Grangegorman Development Agency, the National College of Art and Design and SOLAS. Deputy Farrelly flagged this item for discussion.</p>

          <p eId="para_32"> No. R0045B from Mr. Hugh Creegan, chief executive, National Transport Authority, dated 16 December 2024, provides correspondence to the committee on the national train control centre project. Deputy Farrelly flagged this item for discussion.</p>

          <p eId="para_33">We had a couple of issues to raise relating the NTA. On carriages, we were trying to see if there was a correlation between the briefing that was happening where we were seeing a reduced fleet capacity in some ways. Correspondence said there was an increased fleet capacity on some lines but fleet capacity has also reduced on others. We need to see how that correlates. That related to No. R0020. On this one specifically, can we request an update from the NTA regarding its strategy to keep costs as low as possible? This is to understand the likely overall cost outturn being €188 million. Can we get an update from the NTA on how that is progressing?</p>

          <p eId="para_34">I would like to put the NTA on our list to invite in. It has a lot of projects under way. In particular, I am looking at the contract for payments, which is not going through until 2028.</p>
          <p eId="para_35">I would like to get an understanding of compliance with the public service code and so on to make sure we are getting value for money and an indication as to how the work is progressing.</p>

          <p eId="para_36">We will certainly keep that for consideration under our work programme. I am sure other members will agree to that. Is it agreed that we write to the NTA looking for specific information on costs and an update, as proposed by Deputy Farrelly? Agreed. It is proposed to note and publish this item but to redact personal data related to individuals. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_37"> That concludes our consideration of correspondence this week. We will move into private session before resuming in public session at 10.30 a.m.</p>

          <p eId="para_38">Everyone is welcome. I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are in silent mode or switched off. I will explain some limitations on parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards reference witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence. The evidence of witnesses who are physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege. This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting. However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty, as Cathaoirleach, to ensure this privilege is not abused. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative they comply with any such direction. Witnesses are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.</p>
          <p eId="para_39"> This morning we will engage with witnesses from the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media to discuss the appropriation accounts 2023. I welcome witnesses from the Arts Council of Ireland and the National Gallery of Ireland. Before I call on them to make their opening statements, Deputy Geoghegan indicated at our earlier private meeting that he wished to speak briefly on our engagement last week with CHI. I ask him to be brief.</p>

          <p eId="para_40">The Chair will be aware that I wrote to him on Monday seeking that we bring back the CEO of Children's Health Ireland, CHI, at the earliest possible opportunity. The committee is now in agreement that we will write to the CEO of CHI to ask a number of questions about the revelations by<i> The Sunday Times</i> about the National Treatment Purchase Fund. My question in this instance is for the Comptroller and Auditor General. Has he had the opportunity to review the board minutes from this period in 2021? Will he tell the committee the extent to which the issues revealed by <i>The Sunday Times</i> were flagged in those minutes? The issue was not brought to the attention of the Committee of Public Accounts by the new CEO when she appeared last Thursday.</p>

          <p eId="para_41">We identified a board minute that relates to April 2022 when a report was brought to the committee.

          <p eId="para_42">It was unanimously agreed by the members that we invite CHI and other witnesses to appear again before the committee. I have strong views on the possibility that the committee was misled with regard to information given to it. When specific questions were asked about other reviews or information that should be given to the committee, a definitive "No" was given. There is also an issue with resignations and particularly one resignation that took place from the board during the week of the appearance of CHI before the committee and that information was not given to members of the committee. By unanimous agreement, we will invite CHI back at the earliest opportunity. I thank members for that.</p>

          <p eId="para_43">Moving to today's business, I ask Mr. McCarthy, the Comptroller and Auditor General, to make his opening remarks.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_18">
          <from> Mr. Seamus McCarthy<recordedTime time="2025-05-29T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_44">The appropriation account for Vote 33 records gross expenditure of slightly more than €1.1 billion in 2023. Appropriations-in-aid of the Vote amounted to €218 million. The surplus of the amount provided over the net amount applied in the year was €56.4 million. The Department received permission to carry over €21.5 million in unspent 2023 capital allocations for spending in 2024. The remaining €34.9 million was liable for surrender back to the Exchequer.</p>
          <p eId="para_45"> The appropriation account is presented under five programme headings reflecting the title of the Vote. Under each of the programmes, the Department provides funding to a wide range of public bodies, including the key national cultural institutions, broadcasting, sport, tourism and language bodies. Many of these bodies operate under their own statutory remits. In addition to the strategic policy and legislative role it undertakes in respect of those bodies, the Department plays key roles in assessing the adequacy of their governance arrangements, budget setting and funding provision and in assessing their performance and outcomes. Specifically in the context of today's meeting, I draw attention to the payment from the Vote in 2023 of slightly more than €130 million as core funding for the Arts Council, while the National Gallery received €13.4 million for its general expenses.</p>
          <p eId="para_46">Members may also wish to note the payment in 2023 of grant funding of €195 million to RTÉ, including unplanned interim funding of €16 million. On the receipts side, television licence fee receipts into the Vote were estimated at €237 million but the outturn was significantly lower at just over €201 million. This represented a 9% reduction in aggregate licence fee receipts year on year. </p>
          <p eId="para_47"> The functions of the Arts Council are to promote public interest, knowledge, appreciation and practice of the arts as well as assisting in improving standards in the arts. The Arts Council is almost exclusively State-funded from Vote 33. In 2023, its income from the Vote totalled €133.7 million out of total income recorded of €135.7 million. The council's expenditure in 2023 was €143 million. Almost 85% of this was accounted for by grant payments to support individual artists and arts organisations. A further €7.7 million was spent on arts initiatives. The council's staff costs amounted to €7.4 million and administration costs totalled €6.9 million in 2023. </p>
          <p eId="para_48"> I certified the 2023 financial statements on 24 June 2024 and I issued a clear audit opinion. However, I drew attention to the termination of a project to develop a new integrated grants management system. The original budget set for the project was approximately €3 million with an expected delivery date at the end of 2021. Work on the development of the system had cost €6.5 million to June 2024, when the project was discontinued. The overall loss of value in respect of the project to June 2024 is estimated at €5.3 million. The balance of €1.2 million is considered to be reusable in the implementation of an off-the-shelf grants management system. I note that, while I certified the financial statements in June 2024, they were presented to the Oireachtas only on 12 February 2025. It is normally expected that accounts would be lodged in the Oireachtas Library within three months of certification.</p>
          <p eId="para_49"> The National Galley of Ireland's financial statements for 2023 indicate it had income of €18.7 million, down from €20.45 million in 2022. In 2023, almost 78% of the gallery's income came from Exchequer cash grants via Vote 33. The gallery's expenditure in 2023 amounted to €15.6 million. The total comprehensive surplus for the year was €448,000. In the prior year, there was a loss of €1.22 million. I certified the 2023 financial statements on 30 October 2024 and issued a clear audit opinion. However, I drew attention to ineffective expenditure on an X-ray machine. The National Gallery acquired the machine in 2017 at a cost of just under €125,000 to provide for non-destructive examination of collection items. The cost of the machine was capitalised at that time but we identified that the asset had never actually been brought into use because a suitable location was not available in the gallery's premises. As a result, there was a loss of value of public resources used to acquire it. </p>
          <p eId="para_50"> The report before the committee today examines the usefulness of the Department's published performance information. We focused on the information presented about two of the Department's main voted expenditure programmes: arts and culture, and sports and recreation. Relevant, accurate and timely performance information is an important tool in ensuring the quality of public services and enabling public accountability about how well public expenditure is used. It has the potential to help public bodies operate more efficiently and effectively while also enabling stakeholders to understand and evaluate the outcomes being achieved. However, if managed poorly, a performance information framework has the potential to descend into a mere box-ticking exercise that adds little or no value. </p>
          <p eId="para_51"> The examination found that the Department has significantly increased the set of performance measures and indicators it includes in the presentation of Vote 33 in the annual Revised Estimates for Public Services in recent years. However, we also found that substantial areas of expenditure were not supported by relevant performance measures. For example, for the arts programme, on which €347 million was expended in 2023, the Department has articulated 14 high-level strategic objectives but corresponding output measures or targets were articulated in respect of only six of those strategies. Where measures did exist, it was often unclear what constituted good performance. In addition, many of the context and impact indicators were outdated or of limited relevance as they lacked associated targets. </p>
          <p eId="para_52"> Performance measurement frameworks need to change over time to keep up with changes in the organisation's strategic objectives. It may be appropriate to remove measures that are no longer useful or relevant or to adjust how performance is tracked. The report recommends that the Department should conduct an evaluation of its performance information system to ensure it is using effective measures that best enable it to assess and report transparently on the extent to which it is achieving value for the public money it spends.</p>

          <p eId="para_54">I thank the Chairperson and members of the Committee of Public Accounts for the invitation to attend this morning’s meeting to assist the committee’s examination of the National Gallery of Ireland’s 2023 financial statements and the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General in respect of ineffective expenditure on the gallery’s X-ray system. I am director of the National Gallery of Ireland. It is a privilege to lead an organisation that is of such importance to the Irish public and that cares for an art collection of acknowledged national and international significance. To assist in answering the committee's questions, I am joined by my colleagues from the gallery’s executive leadership team: Ms Kim Smit, director of collections and research, and Mr. Andrew Hetherington, head of audience development and stakeholder engagement. Our director of corporate services is unable to be here because she is indisposed. </p>
          <p eId="para_55"> The gallery is very sorry for the time that it has taken to get the X-ray system up and running. The X-ray system is an important piece of equipment that will be used and provide value for many years to come. We anticipate that the system will be operational by the end of 2025 at no additional expense to the Exchequer. The National Gallery acknowledges weaknesses in its project management practices that contributed significantly to our inability to bring a digital X-ray system purchased in 2017 into use. Pressures on the use of our building, unanticipated operational issues following the gallery's reopening in 2017, the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and changes of key senior personnel during this period have also been contributing factors. We have identified several key learnings relating to: the impact of competing and changing operational needs in a building with restricted space; the impact of a lack of a formal project management structure for special projects; and the impact of a lack of succession planning for key staff involved in special projects. Unfortunately, on this occasion, the gallery did not meet the high standards we set for ourselves. As outlined in our briefing document, we are satisfied that we have put in place improved project management, risk management, procurement processes and other resources so that a similar situation will not recur. </p>
          <p eId="para_56"> When I took up the position of director of the National Gallery of Ireland in November 2022, I was keen to build on the gallery’s many successes and to work with the board of governors and guardians and the gallery's staff on its world-class offering, making its collection and programmes available to as wide an audience as possible both in Ireland and internationally through our exhibitions, research, education and public programmes. </p>
          <p eId="para_57"> The gallery has sought to resolve the challenges relating to the X-ray system project. Following a successful tender process, a contract has been awarded for the construction of a dedicated lead-lined cabinet. This was signed on 27 May.</p>
          <p eId="para_58">Manufacture of the X-ray cabinet will commence shortly, with the expected delivery, installation and operation of the X-ray system before the end of 2025. All costs associated with the resolution of the issue will be borne from the resources generated by the gallery and not from the Exchequer.</p>
          <p eId="para_59"> The gallery is a valued institution which plays a special role in public life. We welcome more than 1 million visitors per annum, which means we are one of Ireland’s most popular free-to-enter visitor attractions and are one of the 80 most visited art museums in the world. We attract visitors of all ages, demographics and abilities, with approximately 30% of our visitors participating in our education programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_60"> We deeply regret and are very sorry that any failings in respect of the delayed operation of the X-ray system would diminish in any way the appeal of the gallery and our collections to visitors from home or abroad. We are working hard to bring the X-ray system into operational use, and it will provide public value for many years to come. On our current schedule, we anticipate this happening before the end of the calendar year. My colleagues and I are happy to assist the committee members and to address their questions.</p>

          <p eId="para_62">I am proud to be chair of the Arts Council. We are here today to provide full transparent information, be accountable for our actions and engage constructively with the committee. I regret the loss of funds on the business transformation programme. This project was not an optional extra; it began out of absolute necessity, and it remains a necessity to be addressed. The reason I was so proud to be asked to be chair of the Arts Council was to support artists and arts organisations and the extraordinary work they make, often for very little reward. What the board wants, working with our executive team and with the Minister and his officials, is to ensure that we have an Arts Council that is expert, functional, efficient and alive with the sense of mission given to us by the Houses of the Oireachtas</p>
          <p eId="para_63"> As committee members will be aware, a full examination report was published by our line Department. I stress that we accept the findings of this report and are in the process of implementing many of its recommendations as they relate to us. Members are also aware that an external review is under way under the leadership of Professor Niamh Brennan. I look forward to taking these items, recommendations and reforms on board and implementing anything further that is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_64"> I wish to make two comments now on reflection. I believe that the expectation of small State bodies with a particular expertise, which are expected to carry the burden of a growing capability and competency requirement such as ICT, is in need of questioning. In addition, I would like members to take the years of 2021 and 2022 in the context of the Covid pandemic. The Arts Council was implementing Government policy at that stage, with a significant increase in funding to sustain artists. In addition, there was a challenge of maintaining the organisation's online working and there were competing priorities with regard to the IT project.</p>
          <p eId="para_65"> Before I hand over to my colleague, Maureen Kennelly, director, I wish to say that this is a setback. It has cost time and money and worried artists, who are often on the financial edge. However, the Arts Council has a single focus to deliver for the arts, and that is our commitment here today.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_23">
          <from> Ms Maureen Kennelly<recordedTime time="2025-05-29T10:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_66">Ar dtús, ba mhaith liom a rá go bhfuil fíorbhrón orainn. This morning, I wish to start by reiterating the deep regret expressed by our chair. The Arts Council began this project in 2017 to modernise our IT systems and to integrate five systems into one. Our systems date from 2008; they are not integrated and are difficult to use. Everything on this project was procured under public procurement guidelines. We used the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, framework, and the main contractor was on the OGP-approved IT framework. We engaged external contractors to manage and deliver the work, as we did not have the internal resources to deliver this large-scale project.</p>
          <p eId="para_67"> As we approached our expected delivery date in September 2022, a year later than initially planned, multiple bugs were discovered. This substandard work meant the project could not move forward to completion. We ended contracts with both our testers and developers, changed the developers, project governance and management structure and began work to rectify and complete the programme. However, following review and attempted reworking, we were ultimately advised by new IT consultants at the end of 2023 that the system was simply too flawed to rectify in a reasonable timeframe. System development then paused, and was stopped following a board decision, with the input of the OGCIO, in June 2024. The effect of this decision was an overall loss of value of €5.3 million, which was reported to the Comptroller and Auditor General and included in our 2023 annual report and accounts.</p>
          <p eId="para_68"> Throughout, we provided information and discussed with our colleagues in the Department how increasing costs were to be funded from within our capital grant. In summary, a lack of internal expertise, poor performance by our contractors and the impact of Covid-19 all contributed to the project failure. We have commenced legal proceedings against two contractors and are in the pre-action stage with regard to two others. We are vigorously pursuing our cases to reduce the loss to the taxpayer.</p>
          <p eId="para_69"> I am glad to say that we have senior ICT expertise in-house now. We have identified and implemented improvements to our procurement and project management processes. We are in the process of implementing all recommendations relevant to us from the Department’s examination report. Throughout the duration of this project, the Arts Council has consistently delivered on its core work through our flagship programmes, partnerships, advisory work and direct grant aid. In 2023, for example, we awarded grants to 588 organisations and 1,880 individual artists through a variety of direct grant schemes. We supported 140 festivals, 318 schools, 31 local authorities and 201 diverse arts projects. When we started this project, we received 3,000 grant applications per year; last year, we received 8,600. Distributing grants effectively and in a way that protects taxpayers’ interests is core to our job and requires robust IT systems. Unfortunately, our challenge with regard to Arts Council systems functioning efficiently remains. We have been supporting the development of the arts in Ireland for 74 years. Art is critical to the health of our country.</p>
          <p eId="para_70"> We deeply regret that this ambitious and complex project was not completed. My colleagues and I happy to answer any questions the committee may have.</p>

          <p eId="para_73"> The 2023 appropriation account includes the tourism and Gaeltacht sectors, which are now transferring from the Department. The year 2023 saw a return to greater economic and societal normality following the Covid-19 pandemic. While the account shows a continued wind-down of Covid-related supports, the Department continued to provide additional supports for energy costs arising in part from the war in Ukraine. Overall gross expenditure fell from €1.2 billion in 2022 to just over €1.1 billion in 2023. The combined effect of Covid and the inflationary environment between 2022 and 2024 had a significant impact on capital delivery during this period, in particular for larger projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_74"> Regarding tourism, 2023 expenditure of €205 million ensured that Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland continued to support one of Ireland’s key economic sectors, employing approximately 226,000 people in 2023.</p>
          <p eId="para_75">This first full year of trading for the sector after Covid saw rapid reinstatement of air connectivity and the recovery of tourism numbers while also dealing with challenges due to loss of capacity in some areas arising from the response of the State in assisting Ukrainian refugees. Funding for arts and culture saw an outturn of €347 million, down somewhat from €367 million in 2022. Nonetheless, much of the increased funding provided during Covid has been maintained. This has enabled the Department to deliver the basic income for the arts pilot scheme, provide record funding for the Department's agencies in the arts, culture and film sectors and deliver an ambitious Creative Ireland programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_76"> Chaith an Roinn €85 milliún faoi Chlár C - An Ghaeltacht agus an Ghaeilge - in 2023, méadú mór ar an gcaiteachas de €78 milliún in 2022. Arís, thug an Roinn an-tacaíocht d’earnáil na gcoláistí samhraidh a bhí ag teacht chuici féin tar éis na paindéime, chomh maith le hinfheistíocht shuntasach d’Údarás na Gaeltachta, agus don phleanáil teanga, chun forbairt na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn. Tugadh tacaíocht do phobal na Gaeilge agus na hUltaise ar fud an oileáin chomh maith tríd an bhForas Teanga, agus trí thacaíochtaí breise a thabhairt d’eagraíochtaí Gaeilge as siocair fadhbanna a bhain le maoiniú An Fhoras Teanga ar bhonn Thuaidh-Theas.</p>
          <p eId="para_77"> Ireland's support for the Olympic Games last year lifted the spirits of the nation. The personal efforts of all our athletes and sportspeople at every level and ability was supported by high levels of investment in capital and current spending. Some €184 million was spent in 2023 to support the sector, including through Sports Ireland and record investment in sports facilities throughout Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_78"> There are 19 bodies under the aegis of the Department, accounting for two thirds of departmental expenditure. The Arts Council and the National Gallery of Ireland are here today, arising out of issues identified in their financial statements for 2023 by the Comptroller and Auditor General. The Department's 2023 accounts reflect the impact of problems which arose in RTÉ in 2023, with TV licence fee receipts falling from €221 million in 2022 to €201 million in 2023. Programme E shows a supplementary provision of €16 million for RTÉ as a consequence. Programme E also shows €6 million in expenditure to support the work of Coimisiún na Meán in its first year of operation, a body which is now essential to regulating traditional and new forms of media, including social media.</p>
          <p eId="para_79"> I can assure the committee that the Department places the highest emphasis on fulfilling our oversight responsibilities in respect of our bodies. Arising out of issues at RTÉ, the Department last year engaged the Institute of Public Administration, IPA, to review our oversight arrangements. The Department accepted all 16 recommendations of the IPA's report and these are now being actioned. This includes the recent establishment of a specialised governance unit in the Department to embed one consistent high-quality approach to our oversight function.</p>
          <p eId="para_80"> The failure of the business transformation project at the Arts Council and the delay in deploying the X-ray machine at the National Gallery have raised further questions for the agencies and for the Department. It is clear from the report which I commissioned on the Arts Council project that the Department failed to properly exercise its oversight function and that we should have intervened more actively and much sooner to reduce the exposure to the taxpayer of this failed project. In response, the Minister has established an expert advisory committee, led by Professor Niamh Brennan, to review the governance and organisational culture in the Arts Council, while a parallel review of the Department’s internal governance operations is also under way with the assistance of the IPA, building on its earlier work.</p>
          <p eId="para_81"> Finally, the committee wished to discuss the recommendation of the Comptroller and Auditor General that the Department completes an evaluation of its performance information system to ensure that good performance measures are being used that enable it to best assess how well it is performing against its aims and objectives. In response, the Department’s strategic policy unit has now commenced an evaluation of current performance information procedures. This review is ongoing and the unit is currently developing a report using information gleaned from the work it has undertaken. I am happy to expand on any of these areas or to explore other areas, as the committee wishes.</p>

          <p eId="para_83">I welcome the witnesses. I have some questions for the Arts Council about the €5.2 million that was written off for an IT system deemed not to be fit for purpose and which was eventually discontinued. When this project was first planned six years ago, it was estimated it would cost roughly €3 million and take two and a half years to complete. Ms Kennelly said that coming up to the expected delivery date in September 2022, multiple bugs and substandard work – I believe that was the term she used – were discovered which meant the project could not move forward to completion and, ultimately, the Arts Council was advised by ICT consultants at the end of 2023 that the system was too flawed to rectify within a reasonable timeframe. </p>
          <p eId="para_84"> By the time the project was abandoned, the cost of the project had reached €6.7 million and the system was not in use. It was over double the cost and double the loss of public money. Can Ms Kennelly very briefly detail the procedures on how the substandard work she mentioned was flagged and addressed, or perhaps not addressed in this case, and how we have learned from that?</p>

          <p eId="para_85">As I said, the project started in 2017 and was not simply about replacing a grant management system. Rather, it was about bringing five different systems into one. Sanction was sought from our line Department and funding was received in September 2019. At that stage, the project was worth €3 million. A contractor was appointed from the OGP and began its work in April 2020. As everybody knows, that was at the start of Covid.</p>
          <p eId="para_86"> There are three factors which we know are responsible for the failure of the project. I will take the Deputy through the history. The substandard work from the contractors became clear quite early. At the end of the year, there were faults and huge staff turnover. Four solution architects and two programme managers left the company. There was a lot of staff turnover in the main developer.</p>
          <p eId="para_87"> We flagged and alerted the council and Department about these matters in early 2021. Remedial action would then be taken and the project would get back on track. I would like to reassure the committee that, while the level of expenditure is very distressing, at every twist, turn and juncture people tried their best to get this back on track. The general advice was that we should keep going at the project and if we spent a little bit more we would see our way through another gateway. We took the best advice available at those very critical junctures.</p>
          <p eId="para_88"> In September 2022, multiple systems failures were discovered. We parted company with two of the companies, a quality assurance company and the technology developer. We sought advice from another contractor to help us to understand whether this was worth sticking with and could be rescued. The advice from it, after quite a lot of detailed discussion and an external review, was that it could indeed be rescued and was worth sticking with. At that stage, we brought in a senior resource from outside. We did not have a senior IT resource, and that was one of the huge failings of the project all the way through. I am glad to say that-----</p>

          <p eId="para_92">It is included in the figure of €6.675 million. We brought that person in via another framework. They were hopeful in spring 2023 and advised that the situation could be rescued, but unfortunately by November 2023 they told us a very different story which was that while the project could be redeemed it would take a further four years and cost a further €6.5 million. As the Deputy can imagine, that was deeply unpalatable to everybody in the council, the executive and the Department. </p>
          <p eId="para_93"> At that stage, we appealed directly to the OGP CIO, which conducted an external review. Under its auspices, it brought in a company in January 2024 to conduct a review to see if the code could be redeemed. As a result of its report and our own separate report, the council decided to stop the project. The project was paused at the end of 2023 and ultimately stopped entirely in June 2024. </p>
          <p eId="para_94">We had an alternative system we wanted the Department to approve and for which we sought approval from the Department. That is in abeyance now until the Niamh Brennan group reports.</p>

          <p eId="para_101">With regard to the late submission of the Arts Council's financial statements, the Comptroller and Auditor General outlined in his opening statement the timeline of when it presented the accounts. The Arts Council presented them to the Department but they were not presented to the Oireachtas Library until four months later. This is probably directed more at Mr. Ó Coigligh than Ms Kennelly, but what was the reason that the Department decided to delay the presentation of the Arts Council's 2023 financial statements? What were the unavoidable delays that were indicated to the committee back in September where they related to the IT scandal and write-down?</p>

          <from> Mr. Feargal Ó Coigligh<recordedTime time="2025-05-29T11:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_102">As Accounting Officer in the Department, when the scale of the loss was brought to my attention at the end of June 2024, and it was discussed by our management board in July 2024, I was faced with a situation where there was to my view a shocking loss in public expenditure. I wanted to know why. We had a situation where we could be presenting an annual report to Government with this significant loss highlighted and no explanation as to what happened. I, as Accounting Officer, had an absolute duty to discover what went wrong here. Therefore, I appointed the former head of audit in the Department to carry out an investigation with terms of reference. Those terms of reference asked for an interim report in September. However, as set out in the final report prepared by the former head of audit, she determined that it was it so complex - she had reviewed more than 500 documents and spoken to many of the people involved - that she was not in a position to provide an interim report at that stage. Therefore, I was very much of the view, and I discussed this with the Minister at the time, that if we were going to the Government to show a loss of €5.3 million in expenditure and €6.7 million on a project we had not delivered, we needed to be able to say what had happened.</p>

          <p eId="para_106">No. The Minister agreed with my view. It was my responsibility as Accounting Officer to find out what had happened here in terms of the loss of public expenditure. My view was that it would be appropriate to understand what had happened so that when we went to the Government with the annual report, we could explain what had happened and have the facts on the ground. In fact, that report, which was published as soon as the new Government met and as soon as the new Minister came in, sets out all the facts in great detail. It is difficult reading for the Department, as it has been for the Arts Council.</p>

          <p eId="para_109">I thank Mr. Ó Coigligh.</p>
          <p eId="para_110"> I will go back to the Arts Council, if I may. The financial strain of everything we are discussing here is being felt in the sector. Ms Kennelly stated that demands for Arts Council funds have risen by 245% since 2020. I have some queries on why the Arts Council decided to reduce the arts grant funding programme without consultation with the stakeholders who applied for it and who rely on it. I know that the reason given was the 10% increase to the Arts Council's strategic funding as it provides jobs, but there is major disheartenment in the sector that 70% of the organisations in that category are Dublin based, and that effectively redirects resources away from regional arts groups. It is threatening the whole vitality of regional arts initiatives and that is despite huge increases in funding from the Government to the Arts Council. There seem to be no published criteria for how an organisation becomes strategically funded. Entry seems to be by invitation only or at the discretion of Arts Council staff. I would appreciate Ms Kennelly's views on that. How transparent or equitable is it? These cuts disproportionally hit small organisations, particularly those outside of Dublin. They believe that there is complete disregard from the Arts Council to them. They are not even listed on the new Arts Council website. Only the strategically funded organisations are listed.</p>
          <p eId="para_111"> Many of them have requested meetings with the Arts Council, which were agreed to and cancelled with no explanation. I understand there has been a change in Ms Kennelly's circumstances, which has come to light this week, and that may be feeding into that, but I would be really appreciative if we could get some clarity on this. Is it linked to the overspend on the IT system? I have conversed with Ms Kennelly on that in the past and she told me it is not, but all the indicators suggest it is. If it is, how will it be rectified so that these arts groups are not discriminated against as a result of mismanagement of public money?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_48">
          <from> Ms Maureen Kennelly<recordedTime time="2025-05-29T11:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_112">To explain for people, arts grant funding is one of 34 schemes that are run by the Arts Council. We made a decision last year to increase funding to strategically funded organisations and arts centres by 10%. We obviously have vastly more resources than we had, but the demand is enormous. There has been a 245% increase in demand, as the Deputy said, over the last three years. Therefore, we had to make a decision about investing in the strategically funded organisations and the arts centres, which are populated throughout the country. There are 66 arts centres throughout the country, so they are most definitely not all Dublin based. While it may seem that with the strategically funded organisations, there is more of a bias towards Dublin, in fact, there is not. We have the Irish National Opera, INO, which has toured 23 counties this year, or the new national dance company, Luail, which will impact on eight different counties. Therefore, I accept that while the Abbey Theatre and the Gate Theatre are in Dublin, organisations like Poetry Ireland and the INO will tour significantly and bring their fantastic offerings to audiences throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_113"> The strategically funded organisations and the arts centres are certainly drivers of employment. The arts grant funding is in a different bracket whereby it is programme funding. We are very committed to trying to increase those organisations in the future because we realise that across the arts sector, costs have risen astronomically for people in terms of travel and accommodation - those are huge issues - and also energy costs. We were very glad to receive extra funding from the Department to address those energy costs in recent years. However, we simply need more money. I would like to reassure people that all the spending on this failed IT project was capital money. It simply was never the case that any arts organisation or any individual was disadvantaged by spend on this. That is simply not the case.</p>

          <p eId="para_117">I will be brief. There is a very strong relationship between our heads of team and the organisations we fund and with which we partner. While it may not be apparent on the website, an awful lot of discussion goes on between people who are funded. What we like to see is that an artist comes in on something, perhaps a smaller fund like an agility award, and progresses right through the organisation. Our heads of team, who are experts in all their areas, work very hard with those organisations to try to develop and bring them through to the next step. I would feel that is true across the organisation.</p>

          <p eId="para_136">The business case was built on a number of reports done back in 2017 and 2018 to look at the systems. It was very much born out of a value for money report done by the Government which was basically saying that the Arts Council could not tell the story adequately about the impact of its funding. There were a number of imperatives driving this, including the fact that the system was on its last legs. It was creaking at the hinges. We also needed to be able to make the case better for funding for the arts.</p>

At that point we had a customer relationship management system, a finance system and a child protection and welfare system. Many of them wanted to be brought together. The whole idea was to replace systems that were no longer fit for purpose. For instance, if an artist wanted to apply for a grant, it was going to take the person at least five days to even get a code to use to log in.</p>

          <p eId="para_186">I agree. Deputy McAuliffe used the painting analogy. The construction scene is very apt in terms of looking at this. This was a project built on extremely shaky foundations. When it started in 2017, the appropriate resources were not there. They were not there until the arrival of my colleagues, Mr. Anyanwu and another colleague back in the office, whom I am glad to say are now in place. They did not become roles within the Arts Council until early 2024, which was a serious deficit. We were in regular contact with the Department to try to get those resources but, unfortunately, they did not come through until very late in the day.</p>

          <p eId="para_258">I will turn my attention to the Department. The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General referred to €56.4 million in unspent capital in 2023, some of which it was possible to carry over. The large part was returned. Will Mr. Ó Coigligh please explain how such a sum went unspent? </p>

          <p eId="para_259">As I said in my opening statement, we were coming out of Covid. There were a lot of difficulties in the construction sector with moving projects ahead. This impacted severely on our capital programme, both in the ability of people to progress projects and the cost environment, which put projects back significantly. The large-scale capital scheme funds very good projects such as the RDS redevelopment and Connacht rugby stadium. All of a sudden, these large projects saw big cost increases in an inflationary environment. The Government stepped in with additional funds but those kinds of things delayed the ability of the Department to spend on its capital projects. </p>

          <p eId="para_260">I thank the witnesses for attending. By way of background, I am a lawyer who has worked on many IT procurement projects. I read about the delivery or, rather, the non-delivery of this project and was astounded. It was very hard to follow. It looks like there were failures from the outset. There was no real substantiated business case and clear purpose or understanding of the milestones to be delivered. This included how to ensure payments were withheld or to make sure services were up to standard. I am very concerned if that is the standard of what is happening in our State bodies. My first questions are for the Secretary General. He has 19 bodies under his aegis. He has admitted that he failed to effect oversight here. We have recommendations from the C and AG and from the IPA. Is there anything else Mr. Ó Coigligh needs to tell us? Is there anything else we need to know? If there is that level of failure in the Arts Council, what else is out there? </p>

          <p eId="para_261">In terms of project management, the Deputy may be aware that when the Minister took office, he was very concerned about this failure and asked me to write to the agencies within the arts, culture, sports and media sectors. These are the continuing parts of the Department in its new configuration. He asked me to inquire if there were any other significant projects of more than €500,000 since 2020 or any other project of significance that should be brought to our attention, where the project was significantly over cost or failed to deliver on its objectives. That did show overall that the buys came back without any significant issues, bar one project in RTÉ, which was the subject of discussion at the Oireachtas joint committee yesterday, as the Deputy is aware. That gives a measure of comfort. </p>

Unfortunately, only 55% of that was in place when the project started. When I started in the Arts Council in mid-April 2020, there was no head of HR and there was not even a head of IT.

          <p eId="para_283">Believe it or not, there is not actually a conflict of interest because I checked this out when I applied for my role in the Arts Council. In fact, I checked it out within the Department and within the Public Appointments Service. I was absolutely guaranteed that there was no conflict of interest because the Arts Council does not fund the National Concert Hall. It is funded directly by the Department. That is very clear. There would be a conflict of interest if there was anything else, so that would not be allowed to continue. I absolutely share the Deputy's concern about that from a governance point of view. </p>

          <p eId="para_285">Yes. I agree with the Deputy. The only feedback that I am aware of, which I am sure many people here are also aware of, relates to the frustration of many potential artists who are trying to make applications on a very difficult system. This has caused enormous difficulty for many artists around the country. I have heard that come through from my family, because they were in school and college with people, but nobody directly connected to us has ever been funded by the Arts Council and, unfortunately, I do not have anybody on the stage in the National Concert Hall either. </p>

          <p eId="para_305">The witnesses from the three organisation before us are all very welcome. ICT has been asked so many questions. They are saying there were no resources at the time, there was nobody in place at the time, and there was no business case at the time. I will not go back over it. I will move on to the art gallery. It is a wonderful facility. I have been down there many times. It is a joy to go there.</p>
          <p eId="para_306"> In regard to this project, they have given the extra figures for the room. Was there a business case at the beginning? A yes or no answer will be fine.</p>

          <p eId="para_316">Honestly, I understand; we all make mistakes. The gallery does a very good job. It is about learning. We are here every week and I am back on the committee, fortunately or unfortunately, in regard to processes. We recently had the national children's hospital before us. We will be coming to the Department. I am not here to go at the witnesses. I do not need any more apologies. We all make mistakes. I am here to see what happened and how we can avoid it in the future. Last week the question of whether a person underwent media training was asked. I am not going to ask that. However, I am tired of the responses that try to please us. It is simply to learn. If we had private companies here, I am sure they would be far worse. Let me say that openly.</p>
          <p eId="para_317"> Let us go back to this machine. When the business case was done, it said buy this machine and this room will be okay. It turned out that room was not okay.</p>

          <p eId="para_318">A room had been identified before the business case was prepared. The room had been identified before the purchase of the machine in 2017. It was then found that the room needed to be used for a different purpose because, in 2017, the gallery reopened its historic wings after a lengthy period of refurbishment. Through that process it was found that the space that had been identified previously for the X-ray system was going to have to be used for a different purpose. Since that time the gallery has tried to find a space in which the equipment could be used. We are focused on getting this equipment into operation. We now have the X-ray cabinet which will be delivered by the end of the year so that we can make the system operational.</p>

          <p eId="para_326">Was that identified at the time? I am confused. A room was identified. The room was not suitable. However, all of that would have been obvious at the time, would it not? An X-ray machine cannot simply be put in.</p>

          <p eId="para_327">For context, we did always have a lead-lined room for X-raying which was a wet processing facility. X-rays have moved to digital, similar to photography, over the years. In that same area, although slightly different, but close to it, a room was identified where that same lead-lining would be implemented and the X-ray system would be housed there. This was not a brand new situation for us to implement. However, as the director said, after the first three phases of our capital programme, we saw that there were pinch points and stresses and strains and that room was required for another purpose. That is when the search began for an alternative location.</p>

          <p eId="para_331">When we have needed X-ray facilities, we have used our international partnerships. We have worked with our partners and, on one occasion, with the National Museum of Ireland. However, there are particular X-ray requirements for works of art, for paintings and drawings. The National Gallery of Ireland is going to be the only place on the island of Ireland that will have the facilities to do this. We are very keen to get the equipment up and running and to make the best benefit of it. One of the first projects we will work on is a study that we have already begun of our paintings by Jack B. Yeats, that have never been studied in this way before.</p>

          <p eId="para_358">I welcome the witnesses. I acknowledge that I previously worked in an arts venue. It was a local theatre in Monaghan. I am very familiar with the arts package the Arts Council is trying to get rid of. I agree it is a very difficult system to use and it needs to be upgraded. The systems are outdated and it is disappointing for the sector that the project was not a success. </p>
          <p eId="para_359">It is incredibly disappointing for the taxpayer that so much money was wasted, just to put that on the record. The IT projects are an area that seems to be particularly problematic in terms of the cost right across all sectors, if the witnesses would be in agreement with that. I have no doubt this committee will engage with other Departments to ensure this does not happen during my Dáil term going forward. IT systems seem to be prevalent at the moment in all media and in all sections of Departments across the board. I want to say at the outset that it is important to make sure this is not running across all Departments. This has to be stopped. This has happened and €6.7 million in taxpayers' money was utterly wasted. Somebody has to hold responsibility for that. There seems to be a systemic issue across the public sector and that is what I want to get into today.</p>
          <p eId="para_360"> My first question to the board members today is whether they requested or enlist assistance from the Office of Government Procurement and the chief executive officer of the Department of Public Expenditure, NDP Delivery and Reform or any other internal government expertise at the outset.</p>

          <p eId="para_361">Absolutely. We brought forward a workforce plan in October 2021. I mentioned earlier that there was no head of HR in place when I joined in April 2022. Neither was there a head of IT. There were very significant parts of the organisation that were absolutely not resourced, which was most regrettable. I brought in a very senior HR person and worked with her very intensively to bring forward a workforce plan. As I said, the council approved that in October 2021 and then I sent it to the Department in November 2021. I highlighted for it that the senior resource in IT was the critical role we wanted to appoint. We wanted to appoint that at principal officer level. The head of IT role that was within the Arts Council before that was just at HEO level. It was far too junior for a project of this scale. I sent that to the principal officer in the Department who was my designated line of contact, with whom I had a very regular flow of information about the whole project throughout the whole project and throughout my whole tenure. She accepted the urgency of it, I think, but our discussions continued right throughout 2022 and into 2023. There was no approval for it. The Department wanted us to recruit at a lower level, at AP higher. It felt it would not be able to get the approval from the Department of Public Expenditure, NDP Delivery and Reform for it. We contested that we absolutely needed it at PO level.</p>

Yes, judgments and errors were made. We must admit that. We have got to learn from that. As my colleague from the Department has said, there is a major series of recommendations. Already, a number of them are implemented. </p>
          <p eId="para_429"> When I came in as chair, I asked that we be given the opportunity to do a review because I knew that areas needed to be strengthened. That will happen when the external review is over. The Department supported me on that. I absolutely agree with the Deputy. There is rigour, honesty and absolute accountability required. That is the only way you restore confidence and that is what we are doing. I believe we will do it.</p>

          <p eId="para_535">I thank Mr. Falvey. The Secretary General mentioned that in the summer of 2024 he advised the Minister to not bring to the attention of the Government the issues that had arisen in terms of rising and escalating costs because he wanted to carry out a further report. That was the Secretary General's advice. He also referred to a statement that the Minister has subsequently issued in recent times when all of this emerged. In her statement, the previous Minister mentions that "a decision was taken for the Department to undertake a detailed examination of the Arts Council’s project and to present the 2023 Annual Report and Financial Statements to Cabinet alongside the completed examination and its recommendations.” The statement says "a decision". That was her decision. Is that correct?</p>

          <p eId="para_548">I think the Minister agreed. Actually the issue of scrutiny is important. Looking at the experience in relation to RTÉ in the previous years, when there was a constant criticism of a drip-feed of information as people tried to discover what happened, I was determined to get all the facts out to the public as quickly as possible, with nothing covered up. There are no black marks in that report covering up information. Everything was put out there. That was the approach and the focus.</p>

          <p eId="para_583">Between 2018 and 2024, the Department sanctioned an increase in staff from 47 to 146 in the Arts Council. That is a trebling of staffing resources in a small number of years, so I think the Department was very responsive. In respect of the chair writing to the Department and complaining of slow responses, there is an obligation also on the chair, in his annual letter with the accounts, to inform the Minister if there are any issues. At no point during this process did the chair of the Arts Council inform the Minister of the difficulty of this project, which is an obligation under the code of governance.</p>

I put in a series of parliamentary questions to the Department with regard to IT projects, and the rationale that was cited for not providing details on those was that due to an issue of national security or cybersecurity, the Department and the Minister would not provide the details of contractors involved in IT services. At the same time, I asked the exact same question of the Department of Defence, which would be equally concerned, I would imagine, about national security, and it did provide details of the businesses attached to the IT projects within that Department. Will Mr. Ó Coigligh clarify why his Department would not be forthcoming about the information about the contractors, given how important that information is?</p>

          <p eId="para_586">I thank Ms Kennelly again for her testimony this morning. I appreciate the briefing document. I found it very informative. What stuck out to me was the number of times she and the Arts Council sought assistance from the OGCIO. It seems assistance was granted in late 2019 or early 2020. What happened after that?</p>

          <p eId="para_587">That was before my time. There was an agreement that there would be a representative from the OGCIO on the stakeholder board. A preliminary meeting was held and then, unfortunately, that person did not attend meetings. I imagine it may well have had to do with Covid. Subsequently, the chief of the OGCIO gave some very helpful advice to me and Martin O'Sullivan about the recruitment of the senior CIO role, which, at that stage, had been sanctioned by the Department at PO level. It was subsequently wound back down to the lower level, unfortunately. He was very helpful to us in that regard. In December 2023, when it was absolutely clear that the wheels had utterly come off this project, I appealed to him directly, and he has been extraordinarily helpful. I have a number of regrets about the project, and one is that in summer 2022 we did not appeal to him directly at that stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_605">It has impacted hugely on the staff. That was a huge concern for myself and for the senior team. We have worked really hard to engage with staff about it. We have a highly committed, deeply impassioned staff. They are very mission driven and it really upsets and distresses me still that their work is impacted because that affects the trust they have with the people they support, which is an extraordinary degree of trust. It is not a normal public service job. These are really highly committed and highly informed people. It is an enormous concern for me. We have worked hard to liaise with our staff, first and foremost, but also to liaise with the people who we fund. We try to do that as regularly as we can because of course people are concerned. Of course, those we fund are being asked and challenged about it. We have done extraordinarily well in increasing the level of public investment, which is absolutely brilliant but, as you can tell, is not enough. I certainly do not want this one-off isolated project to impact on the arts because they are absolutely essential to Ireland's success and the health of this country. I would like the board and the executive to work so hard to make sure that there is no impact.</p>

          <p eId="para_608">I will address one particular point, which is the duty of care related to staff. There is no doubt that this has had an impact. People do not like to think that their organisation is in the media for the wrong reasons, but the senior executive team has worked extraordinarily hard to maintain <i>esprit de corps</i> and to maintain people. You will notice, and I would like this to be registered, there has been no diminution whatever of the services the Arts Council provides since this issue came on stream. That is an important note of public record.</p>

          <p eId="para_609">I thank everyone for their attendance. I know it is not an easy task but we greatly appreciate it. We all have a role to play here. Our role is to ensure the public are getting value for money and that anybody who is in a position to expend public moneys is held to the highest standards. That is what we expect across this House. I also thank the Comptroller and Auditor General for the support that he gives us in enabling us to do this work.</p>
          <p eId="para_610"> The first thing I will say relates to the importance of the Arts Council. It serves a very important function across our society and it does great works in grants. I work with a huge number of organisations and you should see how happy they are when they receive a €500 grant or a €1,000 grant. The waste that has gone on here is unfortunate because of what that money would mean to these small organisations. Is there anything Ms Kennelly would like to say at this point to those small organisations?</p>

          <p eId="para_611">Absolutely. As we have made clear, it is an extraordinary and eyewatering sum of money. I said that I have worked all my career in small organisations. The sum of it is indeed so distressing and so enormous. The money was never going to grants. It was all capital money that was coming to us from the Department. I know we have this fantastic project we want to get under way to create an artists' campus at Dublin Port and €6.75 million would go a long way towards that.</p>

          <p eId="para_613">After the economic crash of 2008, resources were extremely depleted, as they were across the public sector. When I started in 2020, the Arts Council was still in fact suffering from that depletion of resources. It was very underpowered. The Arts Council was bringing in quite a lot of contract staff to take on roles. In the new dawn of increased resources, which was fantastic, we were able to bring on significantly more staff. I mentioned IT resources, HR resources and other very important corporate services, as well as those who deal directly with artists and arts organisations.</p>

          <p eId="para_618">I just feel it is an organisation that may have run away with itself and has now expanded to a point where it has lost control. Governance is now more important than ever before. Beyond the €6.7 million IT write-off, what were the associated staff costs for that project? How many people in the Arts Council were directly working on it? Are there any other strategic project costs that when added, pushed the total misspend over to, say, €10 million?</p>

          <p eId="para_619">No, there absolutely are not. To go back to the Deputy's first point, it is not out of control. The resourcing was very carefully done. There was a workforce plan. There is another, new workforce plan that will be introduced. When we look at our spend per grant, we are actually a very lean organisation. Ninety per cent of the resources is going straight out to artists and arts organisations.</p>

          <p eId="para_687">I thank everyone for coming in and bearing with us as some of our questions will probably be a bit repetitive. I will start from the beginning again. The decision to procure a new IT system we heard was because the Arts Council had five systems it was trying to merge. Why did the Arts Council not consider an off-the-shelf system from the beginning and why was a custom-made system picked? Was there a cost-benefit analysis done at that early stage?</p>

          <p eId="para_688">The reason the off-the-shelf option was not considered - the Deputy will bear in mind this was well before my own time - was that it was a more ambitious project. It was amalgamating five systems into one. The initial imperative was the online services, effectively the grant management system. That was out of warranty and was on its last legs. When the organisation looked more widely, it was felt there were efficiencies that could be made, particularly regarding communicating the impact of our work to the public.</p>

          <p eId="para_691">This project was a key objective of the council and the executive. As the director said, we had a value-for-money study which said we needed to get a lot more data on grant performance. We had the user experience which was not satisfactory and we had the fragility of our existing systems which was really worrying. The council worked completely across this. It was discussed at committee stage in terms of how we were progressing but the key thing was to get the business case into the Department and the council was fully across that. </p>

          <p eId="para_695">Yes, there were, because it was exactly as the Deputy said, really difficult, torturous, detailed discussions taking place on whether we should just call a halt now and write off what was, even by that stage, a significant level of spend. We were then bringing in other expertise which said "No, it is redeemable, keep going." We wanted to protect the initial investment and our big fear was writing it off. Unfortunately, we have come to this. It has not been a happy end but that is what we wanted to avoid all the way through at every twist and turn.</p>

          <p eId="para_713">I have a short question for the Department. When bodies under its remit have a large project that will incur significant expenditure, are there safeguards in place to ensure things are on track? Looking back, it really sounds like the Arts Council was crying out for help and really needed support from the Department. Does the Department have a plan to support its bodies in these circumstances? Alternatively, is it the case that it should not have to support its bodies and that the Arts Council may not be fit for purpose and should be disbanded?</p>

          <from> Mr. Feargal Ó Coigligh<recordedTime time="2025-05-29T13:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_714">There was a certain uniqueness to this project. My response relates to the failure on our part. In 2018 to 2019, when the project was being assessed by our Department and we were coming out of the recession, we, too, were under-resourced in terms of expertise. It was unusual in that there was a specific sanction. Bodies carry out ICT projects on a regular basis within their own capital budgets and follow the guidelines without it being necessary to come to the Department. The ICT project under discussion did need to come to the Department. I am not sure that there are too many of a similar ilk, and I do not think the Department was set up to properly assess and oversee it in carrying out its functions. That was a problem. We have since resourced ourselves in terms of ICT. Circulars have changed. For example, there will be a requirement for a peer review process on a project of the scale in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_715"> Completely outside the process, one of the things that happened here was capture. I am referring to the whole narrative of one more push, we will get it across the line, do not stop it now or we will lose €2 million, €3 million or €4 million, until it becomes too late. That is part of the narrative.</p>

          <p eId="para_719">It is certainly a failure of governance in the Arts Council. For example, this was not brought to the audit and risk committee of the Arts Council. All these facts are set out in the report I commissioned. It is also a failure in respect of oversight by the Department. Therefore, there is failure all around. It is important that our bodies be fit for purpose. As Accounting Officer, I ordered the inquiry so we would have the facts available to present. When the Minister saw the facts, he said the matter was one he wanted to go further on, having regard to the question of whether there were issues of culture and governance within the Arts Council. That is why he requested that an inquiry into the culture and governance of the Arts Council be carried out under the leadership of Professor Niamh Brennan. That is where we will glean further insight, if there is to be further reform carried out in that regard.</p>

It is on the public record - I did everything I could - that I inherited a project that was extremely poorly conceived and initiated and that I did my best to rescue it at every turn. That is important. I am glad to have this forum at which to make it clear that I did my utmost, and I kept the Department informed. For me personally, it is a very disappointing outcome. I came to the Arts Council because I had worked across the board. I thought I had a lot to bring to it. I had lots of plans that I wanted to introduce.</p>

The point was in this regard was put, I think, but I will put it again - perhaps in stronger terms - because there is a perception out there that they were hidden from the view of the public because of the general election. I put the charge that they were suppressed from public view for political reasons in light of the serious and sensitive nature of those accounts in the face of an election.</p>

          <p eId="para_840">Turning to the National Gallery and the X-ray machine, it is extraordinary that a process had been followed without identifying, at the earliest time, an alternative location for the machine. A rationale was laid out for what happened. The space that had been identified was no longer available. I have several questions about this aspect. It was stated that while a cabinet is now being purchased at a cost of €222,000, there was no additional cost to the Exchequer. References were also made to the process undertaken between 2017 and now in the context of utilising partners to address that need. Are these international partners?</p>

          <p eId="para_882">Coming back to the Department, it is clearly aware of its obligations to present audited financial statements within sufficient timelines. I know this query has been put to the Secretary General already. I put it to him. While citing a failure of governance in the Arts Council, he acknowledged a failure of oversight on the part of the Department. Having listened to the responses to all the members who raised this issue, it is clear that the Department - Ms Kennelly has this emphasised on multiple occasions, and I appreciate that - was aware of this issue from the very early stages. It was highlighted in the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General. The Secretary General has admitted that he was aware at an early stage in 2024, if not beforehand. Despite all that knowledge, the presentation of the accounts was purposefully delayed for a period. That really undermines a working relationship not only between the Secretary General and State bodies going forward but also those between the public, the Minister and Secretary General and between the Minister and the Secretary General.</p>
          <p eId="para_883">That is not an easy thing to say, but if we are calling a spade a spade, that is what is said here in black and white today.</p>
          <p eId="para_884"> What assurances can the Secretary General give us that this will not happen again? Can we get his personal reassurance that the withholding of accounts, regardless of the reasons, will not happen again, particularly when Mr. Ó Coigligh knew for some time of the issue which he could have investigated at an earlier stage?</p>

          <p eId="para_885">To clarify, I had no knowledge of the detail or the seriousness of the issue until it was brought to my attention after 26 June 2024 when the accounts were signed off by the Comptroller and Auditor General. They were formally submitted on 24 July. My intention, as clearly shown in the terms of reference of the study, was there would be an interim report in September which we could bring further. However, that was not possible. I made the decision that it was preferable to find out what happened before going to the Government. I appreciate people will disagree with that decision. That was a decision I made-----</p>

          <p eId="para_917">Yes, I know. I am caught for time. The last point I would like to make is that this is as an organisation that is funded by the Exchequer to the tune of 78%. I do not think the argument stacks up that the additional cost will not fall back on the Exchequer. From an accounting point of view, it may well be coming from the gallery's own resources, but, ultimately, there is an opportunity cost involved here. It is an organisation that is funded by the public purse almost to 80%, so I think that argument is only a deflection, to be perfectly honest. This is, ultimately, costing the public purse whatever way one dresses it up.</p>

          <p eId="para_994">When you pursue arbitration you have to set out the height of your claim. What Ms Kennelly has explained is that in one of those cases it is €2.2 million. Mr. O'Sullivan just explained that the value of the other contract is €750,000. Is the Arts Council pursuing the full value of those amounts in its claim that is currently under arbitration?</p>

          <p eId="para_996">So, as matters stand, the Arts Council is pursuing €3 million, and then there is an additional €1 million, which makes up 75%, which it is pursuing against the other two companies. Cumulatively, based on 75% of the impairment, the total value of the claim the Arts Council is pursuing is €4 million. In legal terms, it is seeking to pursue €4 million. Is that not correct?</p>

          <p eId="para_1053">I think we will have to go back and ask for clarification on that, if we may.</p>

          <p eId="para_1054">I would appreciate that. Certainly, reports state that concerns were raised by the gallery, which, legitimate or whatever, resulted in that cabling having to be removed. That obviously increased the cost on the now infamous bicycle shed. Can we have some clarity on what engagement and consultation, if any, took place between the gallery and the OPW prior to that work commencing?</p>
          <p eId="para_1055"> I turn to the issue of fire risk within the gallery because, if that were the case, it was deemed to be a potential fire risk. Is the gallery confident that fire risk is up to date and that it is compliant on fire issues? Have any recent assessments been carried out on fire risk within the gallery and the buildings?</p>

          <p eId="para_1056">The gallery has a health and safety manager who is responsible for these issues, and we discuss these with our landlords, the OPW. Fire is obviously a serious risk to any art collection, and we review this all the time. We have a disaster plan we review and test as well.</p>

          <p eId="para_1061">I have been informed that a company called G4 is currently on site replacing only 50% of fire extinguishers on the premises, and that those fire extinguishers are many years out of date. Is Dr. Campbell aware of that?</p>

          <p eId="para_1062">I can come back with clarity, but we have a rolling process of reviewing our fire risk and of making sure we are compliant. We are conscious of the collection we hold in trust for the Irish people. It is a great resource. Ireland is lucky to have such an extraordinary collection.</p>

          <p eId="para_1063">Absolutely. I do not think anyone is disputing that fact. The specific concern I have is the fire risk to those important pieces and whether proper procedures are in place. The information I have is that procedures are out of date, and it has been suggested that for penny-pinching purposes, it has not been updated and is many years out of date. Will Dr. Campbell give us some detailed information on the maintenance of the fire risk measures and equipment in the premises, when the last assessment was carried out and what the management plan is going forward? I am sure members have many other questions as well. If they have questions, they can feed them in and I am sure our witnesses will have no problem responding to those.</p>
          <p eId="para_1064"> I thank the witnesses and the staff of the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, the Arts Council of Ireland and the National Gallery of Ireland for the work involved in preparing for today's meeting. I thank the representatives from the Department of Public Expenditure, NDP Delivery and Reform for attending. I also thank the Comptroller and Auditor General and his staff for attending and assisting the committee today.</p>
          <p eId="para_1065"> Is it agreed that the clerk seek any follow-up information and carry out any agreed actions arising from the meeting? Agreed. Is it also agreed that we note and publish the opening statement and briefing provided for today's meeting? Agreed.</p>

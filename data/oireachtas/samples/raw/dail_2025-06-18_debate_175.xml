          <p eId="para_11">Before we begin, members have the option of being physically present in the committee room or may join the meeting via Microsoft Teams from their Leinster House office. Members may not participate in the meeting from outside the parliamentary precincts. However, it is important to note that with regard to participation in division, for voting committee members must be physically present in the committee room. I ask anyone joining on Teams to please mute their microphones. There is nobody on Teams.</p>
          <p eId="para_12"> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not, where possible, criticise or make any charges against a person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p>
          <p eId="para_13"> The meeting is being convened to consider the Further Revised Estimates for Public Services 2025, Vote 30 - Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which was referred to the committee by the Dáil on 17 June 2025. I welcome the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Heydon, to the committee. I note that he is accompanied by Mr. Gordon Conroy, assistant secretary, finance and State bodies; Ms Siobhán Dowling, principal officer, finance and central procurement development division; and Ms Karen Hanlon, assistant principal, finance division. You are all very welcome here today. Cuirim fáilte romhaibh.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> Programme D, the seafood sector of Vote 30 - Agriculture, Food and the Marine, comes within the remit of the Committee on Fisheries and Maritime Affairs. Arising from the change of remit, members are asked not to raise questions on programme D with the Minister. The Minister is going to appear before the Select Committee on Fisheries and Maritime Affairs on programme D at a later date.</p>
          <p eId="para_15"> The Minister may call on his officials to speak briefly or clarify during the meeting where specific or technical points are raised, and the officials can clarify issues for the committee. Any follow-up questions should be put to the Minister because he is the accountable person. The Minister's opening statement was circulated, and I invite him to give a brief synopsis before moving on to a question-and-answer session with members.</p>

        <speech by="#MartinHeydon" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture,_Food_and_the_Marine" eId="spk_2">
          <from>Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Martin Heydon)<recordedTime time="2025-06-18T17:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_16">I welcome this opportunity to present to the committee the Further Revised Estimates for 2025 for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Before I commence, I would like to take the opportunity to highlight the importance of farmers, fishers and foresters to the rural and coastal communities across Ireland and how they contribute to the agrifood industry and the Irish economy as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_17"> The agrifood sector remains Ireland's most important indigenous industry, employing over 169,000 people and supporting €19 billion worth of exports. The sector is responsible for the stewardship of 4.5 million ha of agricultural land and over 800,000 ha of forestry. It consists of 133,000 farms, 2,000 fishing vessels and aquaculture sites, and some 2,000 food production and beverage enterprises. It employs 169,000 people, representing 6.4% of the total workforce but a far greater proportion of that is in rural and coastal areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_18"> In an increasingly globalised world, the Irish agrifood sector is a world leader. All of this is underpinned and made possible by the work of those producing the raw material. As Minister, it is my priority to ensure that the substantial commitments outlined in the programme for Government are achieved over the lifetime of this Government and I look forward to engaging with committee members in the years ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> The Further Revised Estimates, which the committee considers today, provides more detail on last October’s budget. This budget was directed at supporting farm incomes and ensuring the continued development of the agrifood industry. It builds on the significant supports put in place over the lifetime of the previous Government and will ensure the progress made in recent years continues into 2025.</p>
          <p eId="para_20"> For 2025, the total Exchequer contribution to the Vote of my Department amounts to €2.14 billion. This comprises €1.8 billion in current expenditure and €336.6 million in capital expenditure. When appropriations-in-aid are considered, the 2025 net Vote is estimated at €1.73 billion. The 2025 agriculture Vote provides my Department with the resources both to deal with the many challenges the sector faces and equally to deliver on the opportunities that exist across the agriculture, fisheries, food development, marine and forestry sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_21"> Budget 2025 was framed in a manner to maintain and indeed build on all the crucial farmer supports. This is evident in the increases to the key supports in the dairy, beef, tillage, sheep, organic and horticulture sectors. The voted allocation also provides higher levels of funding in several key areas including on TB and ACRES. It makes provisions for the introduction of a new knowledge transfer programme included under the €9.8 billion CAP strategic plan and the commencement of the long-established young farmer scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> The agriculture Vote is subdivided into four expenditure programmes corresponding to the four key strategic objectives set out in the current statement of strategy. I will now speak about each of these four programmes in turn.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> On programme A, food safety, animal and plant health and animal welfare, the total allocation for 2025 is €443.7 million. Irish farmers, fishermen and agrifood companies produce world-class food and make products to the highest international standards of food safety and quality. Our food safety and traceability systems continue to be recognised as among the very best in the world. Regarding programme expenditure, I am continuing to fund vital services to ensure those standards are maintained, including the meat inspection service and the various supports provided by the Department’s testing laboratories.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> The level of bovine TB in Ireland increased in 2024. I acknowledge the joint committee discussed that issue today with officials from my Department. As of 1 June this year, 6,448 herds suffered a TB breakdown in the previous 12 months and the herd incidence is at 6.38%. TB is having a significant impact on farmers and their families, both financially and emotionally. As members are aware, I held a TB forum, or a summit effectively, on 8 May, and held a further meeting with farm bodies and key stakeholders on 22 May to discuss a reset of the TB programme and agree necessary measures to tackle the current disease situation based on veterinary and scientific advice. It is clear from my engagement with farmers and stakeholders that there is an appetite for change within the TB programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> The programme for Government commits to continuing to provide support for both the deer management strategy group action plan and the wildlife control programme. It also commits to reviewing and updating the national TB 2030 eradication strategy by working in collaboration with farmers and industry. Continuing to drive down TB levels during 2025 and beyond will require the continued support of stakeholders for additional disease-reducing measures. It is critical that, through working in partnership and joint ownership, all stakeholders take the necessary actions to reduce disease transmission, protect herds from new infections and clear TB from restricted herds, and I am happy to engage further on this later as necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> Programme A also provides just under €50 million to cover both TVI and fallen animals expenditure. It also cover payments to the OPW for the development of Rosslare Europort, which is a critical project to develop the necessary permanent infrastructure required due to Brexit. Some €14.6 million has been allocated to fund this Department’s apportionment of the 2025 development costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> On programme B, farm sector supports and controls, a total of just over €1.088 billion is available to programme B in 2025, and is paid almost exclusively to farmers. This is in addition to some €1.2 billion funding from the EU in respect of the various direct payment schemes. This support is vital to farmers who deliver public goods and environmental benefits. As well as the inherent environmental benefits involved, this investment enhances our sustainability credentials, which are invaluable in serving increasingly demanding and knowledgeable customers at home and around the world.</p>

          <p eId="para_38">I thank the Minister for his opening statement. I will probably chop and change a little bit between the sections but there are a couple of issues there. As the Minister mentioned, we had his officials in from the Department and from the TB forum in regard to TB.</p>
          <p eId="para_39">It is a fairly major section of this. The Minister mentioned this and how he is prepared to discuss it in more detail. One of the things that came from that was that, basically, the proposals coming from the forum are to do more intensive testing to try to focus in on where the issues are, particularly the issues in regard to wildlife and so on. The problem we have identified to some extent is that doing more of the same may not work. We need reassurance, and certainly farmers need reassurance, that we will have a TB eradication programme that will deliver for farmers and for the sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_40"> An issue raised by myself and others here, including Senator Daly, is in regard to vaccination of the herd and the issues that has with regard to the market and marketing our produce. Is part of the investment here to examine the possibility of doing that and how that could work out? While we understand there are many markets out there that find it difficult to accept product from animals that have been vaccinated, at the same time, all of us humans are vaccinated everywhere in the world, and there has to be a certain level of coming to the conclusion that we need to look at this. With the model of farming we have in Ireland, where we have free-roaming animals out in the open all the time, grass-fed and intermingling with wildlife, it will be very difficult to fully eradicate TB. That is a conclusion that an awful lot of people, including an awful lot of farmers, are coming to.</p>

          <from>Deputy Martin Heydon<recordedTime time="2025-06-18T17:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_41">I thank Deputy Kenny for raising those points. He spent a good part of the afternoon on the area of TB. It is taking up much of my time now as well. It is understandably a huge cause of concern for farmers. Let us be honest. We are seeing incidence now that we have not seen before. I do not remember any of my neighbours having 40 or 50 reactors in one herd when I was growing up at home, but that is a story we are hearing all too commonly now. It is a challenge for us. It cannot be business as usual. We have to change our approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_42"> The Deputy talked about suggestions from the forum. The forum reached its point. When I came into this role, I asked it to make submissions. I liaised back and forth with it and then in March, the chairman of the forum wrote to me stating he not feel he could bring it any further. At that point, I called a summit of all key stakeholders. As I said, we have had two very detailed days where I, with my officials, put forward the range of different measures we need in place that will address all three elements of transmission – the role of wildlife, the role of cattle-to-cattle transmission and the role of residual. If we do not cover all three areas, we will leave a gap for this disease to continue to seed out.</p>
          <p eId="para_43"> In addressing that, more testing is a key part. Increased staffing and investment in the area of wildlife is a key part of that. I am putting together a set of proposals that will be very ambitious to support our farmers, with the ultimate goal of making sure that the 94% of farmers that do not have it do not get it, and that the 6% of farmers that do have it have a roadmap and a clear light at the end of the tunnel as to how to get out of this.</p>
          <p eId="para_44"> In the short term, if the final set of proposals that I put forward and implement is successful, it will actually lead to an increase in reactors in the next year or two, and we need that to happen. That is a positive because currently there is skin testing and blood testing. Skin testing has only 80% efficacy. You layer in blood testing at a higher level. Blood testing is not perfect either because it has a higher positive incidence. However, you layer it in and you get over 90%. You then get into a space of having a very good statistical chance of leaving less of this behind. In that space, it means there will be a significant increase in the number of reactors but not necessarily an increase in the number of herds affected. We need to find out where it is in herds at present. That will be success. However, from a budgetary perspective and in the context of this conversation here, that will lead to front-loading of costs. The TB programme is a substantial financial burden on the Exchequer and farmers. It hurts everybody. There are many more things I could do with €100 million to support beef farmers than having to put it into this and to compensation. The overall TB programme reached €100.616 million. That is a massive level of expenditure, and I will need more money to implement the measures that I want to do. That is where I am being ambitious and working with key stakeholders to try to get consensus around a solution that, ultimately, can change the dial and support farmers in this situation.</p>

          <p eId="para_46">I will finish on this point. We do have a different model, but this is not impossible. For so long, farmers have felt it is impossible. It is not. What we have to do now is a range of interventions and measures that will stop the increase that has been happing in recent times, stabilise it and then within a two- or three-year period we could see a very significant reduction in the numbers of incidences. If we get it back down to 2% or 3%, we can talk about eradication with real credibility, and maybe other sets of measures. We have to stop the increase right now because it is heading in a direction that is seeding out and it is not good. It is small in overall terms but the trajectory of growth is going in the wrong direction, and we have to stop that now.</p>

          <p eId="para_93">Obviously I set an ambitious target here. We changed the structures inside it and I gave extra supports to my officials in Wexford to try to get through this and get farmers paid as quickly as possible. When I came into this job on 23 January, we had 14,500 farmers unpaid historically. That was not acceptable to me. With 1,700 of them cleared last week, we now have it down to 2,961 outstanding from 2024 and of them, 790 are from 2023. I expect to make considerable progress both this week and next week again to continue to drive down those numbers. I am keeping the foot to the floor as best I can to keep as much pressure on to get every farmer sorted as quickly as possible. My intention is still to aim for the end of June and to try to keep that pressure on as much as possible. Not every single case can be resolved-----</p>

I am not taking my foot off the gas and we have made significant progress in recent weeks. I understand that if you are one of those 2,961, even though it is a much-reduced figure from 14,500 when I came into this role, it is still cold comfort because you have not been sorted. We are doing everything we can to fix it.</p>

          <p eId="para_96">I acknowledge the progress the Minister has made and the intensity he has put into that programme to get as many payments as possible out. It is easy to be critical but it is important to note that there has been a huge shift on that. I am conscious of time so I will be quick. Is there much uptake of the nutrient importation storage scheme? Is that under TAMS? Yes. The NISS has an investment ceiling of €90,000 which allows farmers to invest in nutrient storage.</p>

          <p eId="para_98">It is okay. The Minister can come back to me on that. I have two quick questions to finish up with. My first relates to the forgotten farmers scheme, the €5 million and how that is progressing. My final question is about the book of Estimates. Under subhead B7, there is a knowledge transfer programme, which was estimated for 2025 and has been revised to 4,000. It is a huge increase. Will the Minister clarify that?</p>

          <p eId="para_99">Regarding the knowledge transfer, the scheme was only coming on board in 2024, so it commenced in 2025, with a first round of payments issuing to farmers in March, with payments to adviser participants issuing shortly. The scheduling affected the flow of the money. The other question was about forgotten farmers.</p>

          <p eId="para_101">This has been a long-standing commitment where I want to put all the legacy issues to bed. Since the Department was first approached with regard to the group commonly referred to as forgotten farmers, who are defined as young farmers who were under the age of 40 in 2015 and established their holdings prior to 2008, I opened a public consultation process for people to put themselves forward. That process has concluded and we are reviewing the results. I have next steps and an allocation in my budget this year of €5 million to address the number of people who are impacted and to draw a line under this issue once and for all. I am not sure yet whether that €5 million will be enough to get everyone resolved this year. If it is more, I will have to try to find more money in next year's budget and to do it over two years.</p>

Once they do, we will examine them on a case-by-case basis and see if they qualify. Of course I will publish the figures of people who qualify in this regard. The process I am going through now is to see if there is enough in the allocation that was made in last year's budget for me to be able to address everyone and draw a line under it. If extra money needs to be found, that may have to go into next year. I am determined to try to draw a line under this issue once and for all.</p>

          <p eId="para_113">I set up a special tranche of TAMS in response to Storm Éowyn. I announced last week that there was 100% approval for all valid applications received under that. Emergency tranche 7 covered Storm Éowyn. It closed for applications on 28 March. A total of 1,945 applications were submitted in respect of the agreed emergency investments to cover back-up generators; sheep, bovine and equine fencing; and wood chippers and mulchers. Approval letters have begun issuing for these applications to ensure that farms are more resilient in advance of future weather events. I have announced plans to introduce grant aid under TAMS for replacement of roofs, which has not been in place in the past. The application process for this specific investment will be available later this year, I hope, when systems are developed. That work is ongoing. In the meantime, farmers are urged to carry out a structural assessment of their farm buildings.</p>

          <p eId="para_116">I could not fund things retrospectively through the TAMS to cover roofs being blown off sheds. Historically, a TAMS grant would only cover a new shed or structure. A number of cases were brought to me. Deputy Fitzmaurice and others gave me examples of sheds whose roofs had been blown off and just needed new power lines, rafters and roofing, but the rest of the structure was sound. I have instructed my officials to allow for that in future elements. These are the learnings from Storm Éowyn. The back-up generators are to make sure our farms are future-proofed for people who are without power for a considerable time.</p>
          <p eId="para_117"> If there is another significant storm this winter, the 1,945 farmers who applied will be better placed to face the next storm. In future tranches, we will be able to have the cover for sheds that are structurally sound but where the roof has been blown off. We hope we do not get many storms such as that one, but we have to prepare for them. This was highlighted to me as something that was missing in the TAMS system and that I would love to address.</p>

That tranche covers the back-up generators, fencing and those elements that were in it. Obviously, there is less risk of a big storm at this time of year. I need the work to be done during the summer in order that we are well placed come next winter for any future storms, and should roofs be damaged in that instance, it would be covered under future TAMS.</p>

          <p eId="para_125">Yes. It is not about Storm Éowyn; it is about learning from Storm Éowyn, where sheds were structurally sound but had roof damage. I want future TAMS grants to be able to cover a scenario where a shed roof is damaged by a storm but the rest of the shed is fine. In that instance, a farmer does not need a brand-new shed; he or she needs a new roof. We know the damage the weight of heavy snowfall can do. If that roof were to collapse, I would see that scenario being covered as well. We are still working on the design of that to make sure that it is robust in future tranches.</p>

One of the things I raised earlier was that even three years or three tests after a farmer's herd became clear, a description of what happened to his or her herd will be placed on the mart's screen describing the animal and where it comes from. The market will be limited then. The animals will only be fit for feed lots, the factory or whatever. We are all terrified of that because it will mean a reduction in price. It is a case of biting one's lip, but people are very worried about that. Why does it have to follow on for so long after a herd is clear? What happens to that meat?

          <p eId="para_137"> I am reflecting on those points of concern that have been raised with regard to herd categorisation. I am trying to see what solution we can come up with to address some of those concerns. However, I also acknowledge that a significant cohort of animals are at much higher risk and, percentage wise, have much greater likelihood of developing bovine TB down the line. Those animals being freely traded and moving around the country is largely what has contributed to a significant proportion of the increase in the spread of this-----</p>

          <p eId="para_138">My time is going. What about herds that do not buy in? Dairy farmers generally do not buy in; they rear their own. That is what they have been doing. At the same time, we are being told that they are the ones with a higher prevalence of TB breakdown than beef herds, which are buying in more often. That is caused by badgers and deer spreading the disease.</p>

          <p eId="para_143">That is fine. We will place as much emphasis on where the problem areas are. It does not, however, mean turning our backs on an area in which disease is seeding out that we cannot ignore. There are three causes of the spread of bovine TB. The Deputy is right; one of them is wildlife. Another is cattle transmission. The last is the residual transmission left behind in the cohort that has been in close proximity to reactors and are much more likely to be infected, particularly females older than 18 months that will be calved and kept for years. When farmers are making breeding decisions, we need them to know the risk category of the ones that are there.</p>

          <p eId="para_149">I thank Deputy Cooney for his comments and the point he made regarding ACRES. I know, from having dealt with him with regard to individual cases in Clare, that this has been a very difficult issue for many of his constituents. I was determined to do two things. One was to address the 14,500 farmers who were due money when I came into this role as quickly as possible. The other was to make sure that the solutions put in place were permanent solutions and not a quick fix, that we put in place the IT functionality and that we got to the bottom of each cohort's issues in order that they do not face these problems again next year and that a similar number of farmers are not kept waiting.</p>
          <p eId="para_150"> ACRES is a phenomenal scheme. More than €500 million has been paid out to Irish farmers since 2023, but a dark cloud hangs over it because not every farmer was paid. My approach has been about addressing that for each farmer who was unpaid and ensuring he or she is paid as quickly as possible while at the same time making sure that those who were not impacted by that got their balance and payments in 2024 as expected. We managed to achieve that. I believe we are now in a space where the solutions that have been put in place are permanent and we will not see anything similar to these challenges in the coming years.</p>

          <p eId="para_151">Again, it is a fantastic scheme. I welcome what the Minister has said. I hope farmers will never be in that position again.</p>
          <p eId="para_152"> The second thing is felling licences. That seems to be a big issue. We were nearly assured after the storm that the processing of felling licences would speed up. There is still timber on the ground and, unfortunately, landowners are finding it hard to get felling licences. What is the update? How can we speed this on? We are still being told there is a waiting time of eight to nine months for a felling licence.</p>

          <p eId="para_153">I am working closely with the Minister of State, Deputy Healy-Rae, on the area of forestry. Really good progress has been made to support those farmers who are significantly impacted by Storm Éowyn. Historic proportions of forestry were flattened around the country in windblown elements. What I and the Minister of State have done is to look to support those 26,000 ha that have been dropped, a phenomenal impact. Some 14,500 ha of that is Coillte lands and 11,500 ha is privately owned. A significant proportion of that was already the subject of a felling licence so did not require one. For those who did require one, flexibility was brought in whereby the Minister of State made sure that a thinning licence could count as a felling licence as well. That covered more and was done to encourage all those who had windblown plantations to get their applications in. Obviously, there is a serious glut of stuff on the ground at the moment. There is plenty there at present that is down and is the subject of a felling licence and that can be processed by the industry. The industry cannot process everything that has fallen such was the level of destruction. At the same time, we process all the other licence applications such that when what is down that is the subject of a licence is cleared, the next is ready to go. We are working might and main on that and I believe we are making very good progress in that space.</p>

          <p eId="para_154">Finally, we have discussed TB a lot today. TB is a major issue. I was surprised today to hear that in 12 months we had an increase of 44% in TB through stock. That is unbelievable. An awful lot of funding is being invested into this. Could we look at different ways of investing funding into it? Do we have all the options as to why TB is spreading so much? I know a lot of work has been done on it. Is there more we can do to fight and to see the amount of funding that will have to be spent in order to curtail TB? The Minister might give an update on that.</p>

          <p eId="para_155">There absolutely is more we can do. We have to change our approach because the current approach is not working and if we continue to go as we are going, the cost on farmers and the cost out of my budget on compensation will be off the charts. If I have to spend more, I would prefer to spend it once-off on a long-term solution that addresses this. That is what the whole approach has been. The set of proposals I have worked through with my officials and all the key stakeholders that I first brought to the TB forum through my chief veterinary officer back in March and that we teased through back and forth in two days of summits in May have allowed us to get to a point where I think we can agree an approach - or we can have an approach; whether it is agreed is up to others - that will give farmers support. It will support those 94% who do not have it to stop it spreading and find that extra disease that is out there, is going undetected at the moment and is causing that problem. It is seeding it out. We have to address that. We have to do more in wildlife and we have to support our farmers across the board. That is what I am looking to do.</p>

          <p eId="para_191">I thank the Minister for coming today and I welcome Ms Dowling, Ms Hanlon and especially Gordon Conroy. It is not often we have two people from the one town. We will leave that as it is.</p>
          <p eId="para_192"> First, as regards the €3,000 ceiling for the cows, many farmers out there are owed north of €3,000 and I think it is the Minister's responsibility to pay them. I have been at a couple of meetings since and when a deal is done, as the Minister knows, a deal is done and the value of an animal is the value. You cannot be left short, and none of those people were told before the animal left the yard, "We are not paying you. We have a cap of €3,000." The Minister answered that question.</p>
          <p eId="para_193"> My next question is about the money for the overrun of the TB. I just hope that the Minister will be able to get that from the Minister, Jack Chambers, because we cannot see a situation where we start to cut back within the ministerial budget at all. These are unusual ones that happen with the overrun. This year we are coming again from what we are after discussing a few minutes ago. It could be double or triple that this year if the trend stays going the same way, so it is very important now to build that in and explain to Jack Chambers what the position is.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">On the suckler carbon efficiency programme, SCEP, is the Minister proposing to give an extra €25 for the coming year? It looks to me that we will be down substantially on the agricultural environmental schemes. Is the Minister proposing to give a €6 increase in the sheep scheme? I want to talk to the Minister about the tillage sector, but I ask him to answer those questions quickly because our time will run out.</p>

          <p eId="para_195">The Deputy's point on TB, which he articulated very clearly here and in the previous meeting, is completely combined with the second point he made. It is about having enough money to be able to address all elements of transmission here and support farmers who are impacted by breakdown. I have said very clearly that €73.5 million was allocated in last year's budget. In last year's budgetary negotiations, that is how much was set aside in my budget from the Department for TB. It is not enough. It will not be enough.</p>

There have been really significant investments around animal handling facilities, and beyond, that are really important. I will work closely with the Minister of State, Deputy Healy-Rae, on this area because I feel very passionately about it. I know he does too. I will work very closely with him to make sure we continue to spend heavily in this area to support farmers and positive, proactive actions.</p>

          <p eId="para_242">On TB, there has been considerable talk about the money involved - up to €130 million, a big portion of which goes to compensation for the farmer. When there is a reactor and the price is agreed, the animal heads off to the factory, which will pay a couple of hundred euro for that animal whereas the Exchequer pays the balance of the agreed funding. Cattle prices are high. There is expected to be an increase in the number of reactors. The factory is getting a lot of low-cost cattle for a couple of hundred euro. That same animal would have cost €1,500 and they are able to pick it up for €400. We, the Exchequer, are paying the balance. Is the Minister engaging with the factories to put pressure on them to ensure they pay a bigger portion to the farmer and, in that way, save the Exchequer money?</p>

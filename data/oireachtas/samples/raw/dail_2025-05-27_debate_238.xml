I remind members that the committee may choose to elect a Leas-Chathaoirleach who can perform the duties and exercise the authority of the Cathaoirleach in his or her absence. It was agreed at our previous meeting that nominations for the position of Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Committee on Justice, Home Affairs and Migration would be sent by email to the clerk by 3 p.m. on Friday, 23 May. The clerk has advised me that there was one nomination proposing Deputy Paula Butterly as Leas-Chathaoirleach. In the absence of any other nomination, is it agreed that Deputy Butterly is elected? Agreed. Déanaim comhghairdeas leis an Teachta Butterly. I invite her to make some remarks, if she wishes.</p>

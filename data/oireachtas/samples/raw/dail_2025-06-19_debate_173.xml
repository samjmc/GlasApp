          <p eId="para_13">I welcome the members to the committee. I wish to remind all of those in attendance to ensure that their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off. Before we proceed, I have a few housekeeping matters to go through. I remind members of the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex. Members of the committee attending remotely must do so from within the precincts of Leinster House. Members are further reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice and ruling of the Cathaoirleach to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. Members are also reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 226 that the committee shall refrain from enquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, who is a permanent witness to the committee. He is accompanied by audit manager at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Mahin Fitzpatrick. </p>
          <p eId="para_15"> The public business before us is as follows: accounts and financial statements, correspondence, work programme and any other business. We will then suspend for five minutes while the witnesses take their seats. We will begin our session with the Department of housing at approximately 10.30 a.m. A total of three sets of accounts and financial statements were laid between 9 June and 13 June 2025. They are due to be considered today. I ask Mr. McCarthy to introduce these before opening the floor to members.</p>

          <p eId="para_21">Correspondence between 5 June and 12 June was issued to members in advance. We had some discussion on category B items at our private session.

          <p eId="para_23">Is that agreed? Agreed. We will consider category C items. No. R0136 is correspondence from the Peter McVerry Trust, which was due to be called in for today's meeting. A number of members have flagged this. I call Deputy Connolly and then Deputy McAuliffe.</p>

          <from>Deputy Catherine Connolly<recordedTime time="2025-06-19T10:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_24">The letter to us is really contemptuous. I say that reluctantly. It is very important that we get accountability. Departmental officials will be before us today. We should have representatives from the board of the Peter McVerry Trust before us today, but we do not. Its accounts are also due. It would be opportune to go back to the trust to ask what the status of its 2023 accounts is, which are very late now. This is 2025. What is the status of its 2024 accounts? They are nowhere if the 2023 accounts are not ready. The board should come before us when those accounts are ready.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulMcAuliffe" eId="spk_7">
          <from>Deputy Paul McAuliffe<recordedTime time="2025-06-19T10:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_25">Like Deputy Connolly, I am very reluctant to say what I am about to say. The Peter McVerry Trust has done, and continues to do, huge amounts of good work, but there is no doubt that when an organisation is the subject of an inspection report, significant amounts of public controversy and, on top of that, the injection of €15 million of public money, there is an obligation on it to communicate that and to come before the Oireachtas. The correspondence the trust provided to us stated that its board appreciates the financial support and oversight arrangements, but the ultimate oversight arrangement in the Oireachtas is the Committee of Public Accounts. I do not believe the Peter McVerry Trust has assisted its own staff, the people who provide donations to it or the Members of this House by not turning up today. In my view, we should exhaust all possible options to have the Peter McVerry Trust before us. I hope we could write to the board today to encourage its representatives to come to a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts and to outline the options we have in regard to compellability and remit.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> There is a difference between the trust's public comments on this matter and the letter. Its public comments indicate that it is waiting for the 2023 accounts, but its letter does not reference that in any way. I have to say I have grave difficulty with that. In public, it is alluding that it is willing to come before us but there is no mention of that in front of us. It is a very serious matter when an organisation does not come before the Committee of Public Accounts, whether it is under our direct remit or not. This concerns €50 million or more. We should get answers on it.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnBrady" eId="spk_8">

          <p eId="para_27">Absolutely.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JamesGeogheganFG" eId="spk_9">
          <from>Deputy James Geoghegan<recordedTime time="2025-06-19T10:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_28">I am willing to give the Peter McVerry Trust the benefit of the doubt regarding what it has put in its correspondence and its sincerely held view that it has nothing further to add to our inquiries. However, we have several questions that we want it to answer on foot of the reports that have been published and the work the Comptroller and Auditor General has done. We are using this forum in public session to appeal to the good sense of those who are part of the new governance structures that are now within the Peter McVerry Trust to come before the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> I am a former Dublin City Council councillor, as is Deputy McAuliffe. I served on its homelessness subcommittee for five years. I fully recognise that the Peter McVerry Trust, almost alone, is delivering the Housing First programme, but that does not in any way obfuscate or overcome the serious financial irregularities and governance structure failings that been identified in the reports. Most of the public who are watching or listening want to have confidence and trust in the Peter McVerry Trust, but are aghast at the idea that an entity that receives so much money from the taxpayer essentially will not come before the committee of the Oireachtas that accounts for the taxpayer. I urge it to reconsider this decision. As Deputy McAuliffe said, it gave a different explanation to the media from what was given in the letter. We are simply asking for the trust to come before this Oireachtas committee at the earliest possible opportunity. We will make that date available.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeNeville" eId="spk_10">
          <from>Deputy Joe Neville<recordedTime time="2025-06-19T10:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_30">I am very surprised that we have reached this juncture. Peter McVerry and the trust have done a lot of good work over the years. They have called out where there has been inaction from the Government side on homelessness. This was the trust's opportunity to stand over the work it has done over the years but, unfortunately, it has decided not to come in. That leads one to conclude that, at present, it is not able to stand over what it has been doing. It is to be hoped it is getting its numbers together because, as yet, it has not been able to furnish the 2023 accounts. As anybody listening knows, the 2023 accounts should have been in this time last year. They should have been furnished by July 2024. It is a year late with this set of accounts. Once again, that draws severe questions over these sets of accounts and the financial management that is taking place.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> People might ask why the committee is pushing so hard on the Peter McVerry Trust. Ultimately, we are pushing hard on the Department of housing. All of us here, even those of us on the Government benches, are giving money to the Department of housing. The money is going to certain places and ultimately we are not sure how that money is being spent. It is difficult to do housing and social housing but we are giving funding to a lot of different bodies to deliver that housing. If how we are doing it and how those groups are doing their business are drawn into question, that ultimately poses serious questions for everyone involved and puts in question the whole format and basis of how we spend that money. We have to ask the Peter McVerry Trust to come in because ultimately it is State money. Questions might be put to us about why a group such as the trust has to come in. Ultimately, it is because it is spending State money. The next phase of spending through the Department of housing is relevant in this context. Money goes from the Department to the trust and, ultimately, groups such as that have to manage it well. The trust should and has to come in. A really strong message has to go out from all of us in this room that it has to come in to explain itself. As I said, it puts the whole process in question and undermines the good work that not only the trust is doing but other bodies like it might be doing.</p>

        <speech by="#CathyBennett" eId="spk_11">
          <from>Deputy Cathy Bennett<recordedTime time="2025-06-19T10:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_32">I agree with everybody who has spoken that it is totally unacceptable that the Peter McVerry Trust did not come before us today. There is an onus on the Department, the Government and the Minister to ensure that governance is carried out for all charitable organisations that receive money from their Departments. The 2023 accounts have to come before us. The Peter McVerry Trust will have to come before us at that stage as well. It is very disappointing that it has not come here today to let us question it on what has gone on. The Department, the Government and the Minister should be putting in governance structures to ensure that charitable organisations are held accountable.</p>

          <from>Deputy Séamus McGrath<recordedTime time="2025-06-19T10:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_33">I reiterate what everyone has said. The thrust of the letter we received indicating that the trust is not willing to come before us is totally unacceptable. We need to implore it to come before us. We are talking about a significant amount of public money. I agree with Deputy Neville that there is a wider issue with the public money put into housing bodies. The Peter McVerry Trust is the one in the spotlight at the moment but a significant amount of our expenditure is directed through housing bodies. We need to explore this further in respect of the Peter McVerry Trust but there is a wider issue we need to look at as well.</p>

          <p eId="para_35"> That the Peter McVerry Trust thinks it does not have an obligation to come before us is wholly disheartening. In 2020, its total income was €56.45 million, of which €29.96 million came from the State. In 2021, it received €53 million, of which €38 million was from the State. In 2022, its income was approximately €61 million. There is no guarantee of what the State figure was, but it might have been above €40 million. For the trust to say it does not feel it has an obligation to be before us is a complete and utter joke. I propose we write to the organisation again and adamantly request that its representatives comes before us in good faith and answers the questions we have. If it is the case of a new governance structure, let us ask them what happened under the previous one, what they have learned and how can we ensure it sets out on its intended purpose, namely, to provide housing for the most vulnerable in our society and to support doing that job.</p>

          <p eId="para_36">I fully agree with members. There is a real level of dissatisfaction and anger among members, myself included. There have been attempts over the past year to get representatives of the Peter McVerry Trust to appear before the Oireachtas joint committee on housing. Different arguments had been given as to why they could not or would not appear before the committee. We have the ultimate responsibility in terms of oversight and governance as to how taxpayers' money is spent. Members have given figures regarding the huge sums of money received by the Peter McVerry Trust via the Exchequer. There needs to be accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_37"> I propose that we write immediately to the Peter McVerry Trust imploring it to come in at the earliest opportunity and that we will be examining what options are open to us in terms of extending our remit. I propose that we engage with the Committee on Standing Orders and Dáil Reform to explore what options are open to us at this point. As members said, it is deeply unsatisfactory and disheartening when an organisation such as the Peter McVerry Trust does not actually take cognisance of the last word in its name: "trust". Public trust is at the foremost here. People cannot have trust in how public money is being spent and the governance around that. That is deeply concerning. Is it agreed that we follow that course of action? Agreed. Are there any other actions relating to the correspondence that members wish to propose? No.</p>
          <p eId="para_38"> The committee has agreed its work programme until the summer recess. Next week on 26 June, An Garda Síochána and the Commissioner will appear before the committee. On 3 July, Children's Health Ireland and NTPF will come in. On 10 July, the Department of public expenditure and reform with representation from the NSSO will appear before the committee. On 17 July, HIQA and the Department will appear before us. Is that agreed? Agreed. Are there any other items committee members wish to discuss? No.</p>
          <p eId="para_39"> That concludes our consideration of the correspondence this week. We will suspend briefly and resume with our engagement with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. Go raibh maith agaibh.</p>

          <p eId="para_40">This morning we will engage with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to discuss its appropriation accounts for 2023. We welcome the following officials from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage: Mr. Graham Doyle, Secretary General; Mr. Fintan Towey, assistant secretary of the water division; Ms Caroline Timmons, assistant secretary of the housing policy and standards division; Mr. David Kelly, assistant secretary of the homelessness, rental and social inclusion division; Mr. Paul Benson, assistant secretary of the social housing delivery division; and Mr. Paul Hogan, assistant secretary of the planning division.</p>
          <p eId="para_41">Finally, we are also joined by a representative from the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform, Ms Jenny Connors, principal officer, housing Vote. They are all very welcome here this morning. </p>
          <p eId="para_42"> I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practices of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence. The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts, is protected pursuant to both the Constitution and statute by absolute privilege. This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything said at the meeting. Witnesses are, however, expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure this privilege is not abused. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory regarding an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative any such direction is complied with. </p>
          <p eId="para_43"> Witnesses are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that may be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. If their statements are potentially defamatory regarding an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction. </p>
          <p eId="para_44"> I ask Mr. Seamus McCarthy, Comptroller and Auditor General, to make his opening remarks.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_16">
          <from> Mr. Seamus McCarthy<recordedTime time="2025-06-19T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_45">The 2023 appropriation account for Vote 34 records gross expenditure of €6.663 billion. This was up from €5.63 billion in 2022, representing an increase of 18% year-on-year.</p>
          <p eId="para_46"> Expenditure from the Vote is presented under six programme headings. The largest by value are the housing programme, the water services programme and the programme to support the operations of local government. Together these account for 94% of the gross expenditure under the Vote. The remaining three programmes relate to the building and infrastructure planning system, including the funding of planning-related bodies, Met Éireann and built and natural heritage, including the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS. The funding provided for the Vote included €340 million of unspent capital funding carried over from 2022. A Supplementary Estimate late in 2023 provided an additional net €153 million for the Vote. The surplus of the amount provided over the net amount applied in the year was €155.3 million. Of this, €141 million in unspent 2023 capital allocations was carried over to 2024. The balance of €14.3 million was liable for surrender back to the Exchequer.</p>
          <p eId="para_47"> The Local Government Fund is managed by the Department separately from the Vote. The fund is mainly comprised of the proceeds of the local property tax, LPT, and a transfer from the Vote. In 2023, LPT receipts into the fund amounted to €558 million. The transfer to the fund from the Vote amounted to €520 million. This was up by €133 million, or 34%, year-on-year. This increase was to cover certain additional supports to local authorities due to rising energy costs. The fund expenditure in 2023 amounted to €989 million, the bulk of which was accounted for by transfers to local authorities. At the end of December 2023, the fund’s reserves stood at just over €293 million. I issued clear audit opinions on both the Vote and the fund accounts.</p>
          <p eId="para_48"> Turning to the report matters before the committee today, local authorities receive a sizeable portion of their annual funding from a wide range of central government Departments and agencies. Each year, my office prepares a report that presents an overview of the amounts and purposes of the funding provided from central government sources to local authorities, as set out in chapter 2. In 2023, aggregate funding from central government to local authorities amounted to almost €6.73 billion. This was a net increase of approximately €750 million on the 2022 level of funding. The primary sources of funding in 2023 were the Departments of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and Transport. Together, these accounted for approximately 92% of the transfers.</p>
          <p eId="para_49"> Chapter 11 reviews the events which gave rise to the need in late 2023 for the allocation from Vote 34 of exceptional funding of €15 million for the Peter McVerry Trust. This is an approved housing body, AHB, and charity that provides housing and other supports to a substantial number of people in a network of accommodation settings. In the normal way, the Department provides funding for homelessness services in the Dublin region to the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, in line with an agreed profile over the budgeted year. In turn, under agreements between the executive and service providers, the executive provides both recurrent funding and capital funding for new developments to a range of service providers.</p>
          <p eId="para_50"> The examination found the executive provided several advances of planned funding to the trust between March and September 2023 without the Department’s approval. Because of cash flow issues in the trust, Government approval was granted in November 2023 for the payment of up to an additional €15 million to the trust. Around the same time, the Department approved the advancing of €2 million of normal funding to the trust but the executive paid advances totalling €5.3 million. That is €3.3 million more than was provided. Although generally a condition of the provision of advances of funding, approval from the Department of Public Expenditure was not obtained for any of the advance funding provided to the trust in 2023.</p>
          <p eId="para_51"> The examination also considered the Department’s monitoring of the conditions attached to the exceptional funding. One of those conditions was the provision by the trust of a restructuring and rationalisation plan. While the trust submitted a plan as requested, the Department stated it did not consider it within its remit to assess the likely efficacy of the proposed changes. The arrangements did not provide for such an assessment to be undertaken. The examination concluded that the Department should have greater oversight of the controls used by DRHE. The Department should also ensure it obtains relevant evidence of the trust’s compliance with all the conditions attached to the exceptional funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_52"> The Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund, LIHAF, was initiated as a scheme in 2016. It was intended to address the issue of housing supply by removing infrastructure blockages through investment in projects such as new access roads or provision of water or drainage systems. Chapter 12 of my report examines the progress made in completing LIHAF projects and the fund’s impact on housing development. Some 30 projects proposed by local authorities with an aggregate projected cost of €196 million were approved by the Department for LIHAF support. The Department committed to providing funding of €147 million, or 75% of the cost, with the remaining 25% to be funded by the sponsor local authorities from their own capital resources. The approved projects were mainly roads-related and were to be completed by the end of 2021. They were expected to support the delivery of almost 20,000 housing units on the sites serviced by the new infrastructure. The examination found that six of the projects were not proceeding. In effect, this reduced the target housing delivery under the scheme to just over 16,000 units.</p>
          <p eId="para_53"> Funding from the Department for the remaining 24 projects was expected to amount to €197 million, compared to the original commitment of €147 million for 30 projects. At the end of 2023, two years after the target completion date, 12 projects had been completed, eight were still in progress and four had not commenced. The housing output achieved on the sites served by LIHAF projects was approximately 6,400 housing units at the end of 2023. </p>
          <p eId="para_54">This was just 40% of the reduced target. Consequently, the expected acceleration of housing delivery does not appear to have been achieved under the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_55"> The Accounting Officer may be able to provide a further update on the output of the scheme.</p>

          <from> Mr. Graham Doyle<recordedTime time="2025-06-19T10:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_57">I thank the Chairman. I speak this morning as the Accounting Officer to assist the committee in the examining of the appropriation account of 2023 for Vote 34 and its chapters. The Chairman has introduced my colleagues. Together, we look forward to discussing the expenditure and activity of the Department in 2023 and we have provided an advance briefing for the meeting. As our time is limited, I do not propose to mention every area of expenditure in the opening statement but will touch on some key areas briefly.</p>
          <p eId="para_58"> I will start by welcoming the work of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the appropriation account for the Local Government Fund and also on the chapters to be examined over the course of this morning.</p>
          <p eId="para_59"> At the outset, I would like to mention the scale and breadth of the activities of the Department, which now has eleven divisions and deals with a number of priorities under the programme for Government. While housing is the most high profile of our responsibilities, this Department has a diverse range of other responsibilities and a wide remit across a number of additional areas including water, local government, electoral reform, planning, Met Éireann and heritage. The focus and commitment of staff working in the Department, and indeed across more than 20 bodies under our aegis, together with local authority partners and stakeholders, is very significant.</p>
          <p eId="para_60"> Total gross expenditure in respect of the Department’s strategic programmes reached €6.8 billion in 2023. Exchequer expenditure of €6.3 billion was supplemented by capital carryover from 2022 of €340 million plus €168 million from local property tax receipts, which was used by certain local authorities to fund a range of housing programmes. The Exchequer funding element comprised €2.9 billion in current expenditure and €3.6 billion in capital expenditure, including capital carryover.</p>
          <p eId="para_61"> During 2023, positive indicators emerged in terms of the critical objective of increasing overall housing supply. The number of new homes delivered during 2023 overall reached 32,695, an increase of 10% on delivery in 2022 and exceeding Housing for All’s 2023 target of 29,000. </p>
          <p eId="para_62"> By the end of 2023, the pipeline for future growth was also strong, with 32,800 new homes commencing construction in 2023. Planning permission was granted for 41,000 new homes in 2023, an increase of approximately 20% on the previous year. Furthermore, by the end of the year, the Land Development Agency had existing planning permission for over 5,000 affordable homes on State-owned or State-acquired land, with many projects already under construction and others at an advanced planning stage. While these indicators demonstrated a strong year-on-year upward trajectory, at a broader level we continue to see major challenges around increased demand, increased costs and complex issues around unlocking supply at the pace and scale required. This will remain an area of acute focus for the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_63"> In the area of social and affordable housing, almost 12,000 new social homes were delivered through social housing build, acquisition and leasing programmes in 2023. The launch of the new secure tenancy affordable rental investment scheme, STAR, also provided a new vehicle to invest up to €750 million in the delivery of over 4,000 cost-rental homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_64"> Along with new homes, initiatives to make homes more affordable, like the first home scheme and help-to-buy, also had a real impact. Existing vacant and derelict homes were also brought back into use, with just over 3,000 vacant property refurbishment grant applications approved during the year. Close to 2,500 couples and individuals availed of the first-home scheme and 7,266 couples and individuals availed of the help-to-buy scheme. Overall, over 4,000 affordable housing options were delivered in 2023 across the range of affordable housing schemes, an increase of 128% on the previous year, highlighting the significant progress achieved in relation to developing and expanding the affordable pipeline. Affordable housing schemes are now operating at scale and the affordable housing programme has continued to be expanded and developed by all delivery partners.</p>
          <p eId="para_65"> Urgent delivery of social and affordable homes is not just about numbers and statistics. We are keenly aware of the impact that social and affordable housing provision has on the households and families who receive the keys to their homes. This urgency is also felt by our many delivery partners across the local authority and approved housing body sector. We continue to work proactively with all of our key stakeholders to create the conditions that facilitate increased housing supply across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_66"> Addressing homelessness remains one of the most acute priorities of the Government and this Department. In 2023, funding of in excess of €317 million was provided to local authorities towards the provision of homelessness services. This funding ensured there was sufficient accommodation for those who needed it and the continuation of prevention and tenancy sustainment measures, including essential outreach services and on the ongoing provision of Housing First. At the end of 2023, the total number of people being supported in homelessness emergency accommodation was 13,318. This represented a 14.5% year-on-year increase, totalling 1,686 people. There was a total of 6,848 adult exits and preventions from homelessness in 2023, a 25% increase on 2022 figures. This increase in preventions and exits was aided by the tenant in situ scheme. In 2023, an additional 320 tenancies were recorded nationwide under the Housing First national implementation plan. This brought the total number of tenancies to 560 under the current plan, exceeding the two-year target.</p>
          <p eId="para_67"> Overall, planning reform was a key focus in 2023, with the Planning and Development Bill published in November 2023 and completed last year. In light of the growing demands on planning authorities, in October 2023, the Department confirmed approval for the filling of an initial 100 posts in the local authority planning service and approval was also granted for additional resources in An Bord Pleanála.</p>
          <p eId="para_68"> Moving to water, water services continue to undergo a significant period of reform in the delivery of services. In 2023, the Department continued to work closely with stakeholders including Uisce Éireann, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities and local authorities. The framework for future delivery of water services provides the basis for Uisce Éireann to work with local authorities to complete the integration of public water services. Local authorities will cease involvement in the direct provision of water services from December 2026.</p>
          <p eId="para_69"> The Government’s voted Exchequer investment in Uisce Éireann is substantial under the NDP. Over €1.6 billion was spent by Uisce Éireann in 2023 to service existing schemes and deliver new water infrastructure and investment. This investment in public water services is vital to maintain and enhance infrastructure, safeguard public health, ensure environmental compliance by adequately treating wastewater and support the delivery of housing and other economic activity. Uisce Éireann delivered a record level of capital investment of over €1 billion in 2023, mainly driven by mains rehab and above-ground capital programmes. The Government is delivering a sustainable funding path to further enhance the ongoing significant improvements in our public water and wastewater services and this level of investment will continue under the NDP. To conclude on water, I wish to mention the almost €62 million that was provided in 2023 for the rural water scheme. Certainty for priority investment has been put in place through a multi-annual capital programme aimed at improving the reliability and efficiency of rural water services infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_70"> As I said at the outset, the brevity of my statement does not facilitate lengthy discussion on all activities, and I have not gone into detail on the activities during 2023 in local government, heritage and Met Éireann where considerable, valued work was undertaken, supported by significant Exchequer investment. However, I and my colleagues will of course be happy to discuss these areas with the committee during this morning’s session.</p>
          <p eId="para_71"> In conclusion, I again note the ongoing co-operation of all stakeholders involved in the delivery of a work programme of the scale undertaken by this Department. The Department, its agencies and our partners for delivery, including the local authorities, NGOs and AHBs, continue to be acutely focused on achieving the best for the public.</p>

Unfortunately for him, I am also a member of the committee on housing so I will reserve some of my question for the next time he appears there. I will focus on the financial issues this morning. The previous committee on housing and Committee of Public Accounts had sought to have further details about what was known as the "bailout" of the Peter McVerry Trust. On two occasions previously, both the Peter McVerry Trust and the Department said they were not in a position to appear before the Oireachtas because they were waiting for the outcomes of the investigation reports that were taking place. When did the Department first become aware of the financial issues that took place in the Peter McVerry Trust?</p>

          <p eId="para_77">Obviously, the committee has highlighted the good work being done by the Peter McVerry Trust on the ground and there was an obligation on the Department to ensure it continued. The Comptroller and Auditor General, however, has made some strong points concerning the advancing of funds without, in some cases, the necessary approval from the Department of public expenditure and reform or Mr. Doyle's own Department in the case of the Dublin Region Homeless Executive. I ask Mr. Doyle to comment on this matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_78">Yes, there is a circular from 2014 requiring that we do not issue advanced funding or that it is approved. In the case of the funding the Department chose to advance in this case, which amounted to €2 million, the urgency of the situation was extremely acute at that time. Up to 2,000 people were in receipt of homeless services of various types, including Housing First, from the Peter McVerry Trust at that point. There was a significant number of staff, around 500 people, but I do not have the exact number, and there were potential losses of staff and services. There was the potential for this to impact greatly on vulnerable members of the public availing of those services. In light of the urgency, that €2 million was advanced. It was funding the trust would get in any event. We absolutely acknowledge that, as the Comptroller and Auditor General pointed out, it was not in compliance with the circular. I apologise for that, but I stand over it in the sense of the urgency of the situation and the need to protect those services.</p>

I ask Mr. Doyle to comment on the decision of representatives of the Peter McVerry Trust not to attend this meeting and be beside him here answering these questions. Mr. Doyle must feel like that is a little bit ungrateful when the organisation his Department took fairly significant steps to fund - in some cases, as outlined, being forced to breach the circular - and ultimately provided with €15 million to provide services, has decided not to be here today.</p>

There is a new protocol in place for how those reserves will be used. They get built up because the allocations under the Local Government Fund are done in advance. When property tax comes in, arrears are paid and there are also LPT payments in advance. Some of these ultimately result in reserves in the fund and it is a matter of discussion between ourselves and the Department of public expenditure as to how these funds are used.

          <p eId="para_128">Okay. It is good to see the money being put to good use. That is what it is for. Part of the difficulty we have is that some of the self-funding local authorities were allowed to keep 100% of their local property tax but in essence that means absolutely nothing. They do not keep 100% of it because they lose out in other ways. It is galling to see a figure of even €200 million, if it has dropped. The idea that €300 million could be sitting there when a local authority and people in Dublin city are paying their local property tax and do not get to keep it all because of the self-funding cap on top of that. Those self-funding caps have to be addressed. It is a policy matter and I do not expect Mr. Doyle to comment on it but they have to be addressed. It is galling that there is €293 million sitting in a fund when we are looking at other ways to fund, for example, the Dublin city task force and so on. </p>

It is LPT prepaid of €78,000, €85 million for the water transformation, €33 million for local property equalisation costs and €3.5 million towards miscellaneous costs, which will leave €33 million in the fund in 2026.

          <p eId="para_159">I will make some general comments on approvals and funding. We have built a very significant pipeline with local authorities and AHBs. That pipeline is expensive. There have been significant construction costs due to inflation. We are working within NDP envelopes and that NDP, as the Deputy knows, is up for review in 2026. At this point, we have to be cautious about what we approve for future years. I expect, with the conclusion of the NDP in July 2025, we will be in a strong position financially to deal with everything we have on our desks. At the moment we are still approving projects. </p>
          <p eId="para_160">I know there has been a narrative to the contrary. We are approving social and affordable housing projects across cost rental, direct local authority builds and AHB builds. There are projects with us that we are still considering for funding approval. They are more complex and bigger. Many of them are in the big urban areas. They are apartment blocks, which take more time-----</p>

There are projects with us that are subject to further information requests or are being assessed by our technical advisers. There are a couple of projects on my desk from the cost rental equity loan side, but they are awaiting funding to be approved on the CALF side or an application to come in from the AHBs. A project cannot proceed unless both are approved because if they are in the same development, the contractor requires them both in order to proceed. Those two are waiting but not because of any delay in funding. On the CALF side, we have 12 applications that are through the final stages now. We are working our way through-----</p>

That was because the Government recognises that there are funding challenges arising from the last NDP. Last year we dealt with that funding shortfall by way of a Supplementary Estimate, as the Deputy is probably aware. This year the Government has given us an extra €715 million. We made the Government aware that additional funding will be required but it is not required immediately. It will be required later in the year so that we can meet commitments-----</p>

We spent about €1 billion over and above the overall housing capital allocation in 2024.

          <p eId="para_172">It relates to the number of projects that came through from the local authority sector that year. Very significant funding is available for that scheme. I am trying to find my notes on it. I believe that approximately 2,250 retrofits were carried out in that year. The intention would have been to do something a bit higher than that. The target was closer to 3,000 that year. The uptake has since improved.</p>

          <p eId="para_173">I appreciate that. Under affordable housing, in the 2023 figures we budgeted for €90 million and we spent €20 million. That is a huge disparity.

          <p eId="para_174">I completely recognise those comments. Those affordable schemes were very much in their infancy at that point in time. A range of very new schemes had been developed, all to do different things. It was critical to try to build a pipeline under those schemes. We built that pipeline with delivery in the following year. The delivery since then has been very strong. I am happy to take the Deputy through the figures if he wishes.</p>

          <p eId="para_175">Our spend on homelessness in 2023 was €317 million. That just brings me to the current situation with the tenant in situ scheme, which has effectively stalled throughout the country from what I can see because of budgeting issues.

We have secured additional funding to bring the budget up to €325 million for that. A purchase under the tenant in situ scheme is a response that the local authority can use in certain circumstances. We have continued to support that. The Minister has secured additional funding this year to support it. If the Deputy would like any details on the numbers, I have them here.

          <p eId="para_185">I am sorry for rushing Mr. Doyle, but I would like to ask a final question. It relates to the spend on designing housing schemes. Essentially, we uniquely design every housing scheme across the country. Why are we not moving to more standard designs where we have a range of templates that we can use? I am sure our spend on design is quite high. Why are we doing that? Why does every scheme have to be unique?</p>

          <p eId="para_186">We absolutely are moving to such an approach. We have been doing so. We have a new design manual in place - it is not quite new anymore - that we are strongly encouraging. It has been made all but mandatory in local authority schemes in terms of the layouts of houses provided for different sets of circumstances. There is a very detailed manual. It supports modern methods of construction. There are all kinds of benefits to it. It gets local authorities through the process much faster if they use it. I am very happy to talk about it but I know time is limited.</p>

          <p eId="para_189"> Why are different county councils funded so differently? I see the expenditure per head.

          <p eId="para_191">No, I mean Government funding for local authorities. In County Kildare, the spend per head of population is €715. That is the equivalent annual spend per person under the council budget. The equivalent spend in Dublin City Council is €1,900, which is the highest. The second highest is County Leitrim, at €1,256. I wanted to show the variances. Kildare is consistently the lowest. I think County Galway is one of the lowest as well. Why is that the case, especially given that these are areas of rising population? Why are some counties treated differently in their funding from the Department on the local government side?</p>

          <p eId="para_193">Most of it comes from the Department. My colleague, Deputy McAuliffe, made the point earlier that people pay their property tax. Obviously it is capped but the more money you get, the more you lose out in other Government funding. The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage consistently gives less money to Kildare County Council per head of population. As our population has increased, we have actually lost out significantly. That reduces our services and our ability to put the services in place for our communities. That needs to be changed from the Department. I would be delighted if the Department could look at it for next year. From the council's perspective, we have been pushing to get that in place. It is unfair and it needs to be looked at properly. In fairness, it was raised earlier.</p>

Someone can only use a local authority home loan as long as they are buying a house for €360,000 or less. Bizarrely, affordable houses in Kildare are being priced at €365,000.

          <p eId="para_241">I fully agree with Mr. Doyle on the scale of the work the Department does. I appreciate that work. It is huge and represents the public service at its best if it is done to a standard. I will be very constructively critical about the vision that is there, the targets being achieved and the reality on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_242"> I will begin with the Peter McVerry Trust. I hope it will see sense and come before us. I have before me a chapter from the Comptroller and Auditor General, a section 47 inspector’s report and reports that were requested by the voluntary housing associations and the Charities Regulator. All those reports relate to an entity that was pushed into a position of providing homeless accommodation because the State did not do it. We all praised it in the past, but is it not the case that we have a debacle on our hands now in respect of the lack of oversight and monitoring? That is what is happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">In the opening statement or some of the documentation we got they talked about 2,000 clients. I think in one of these reports they talk about 19,000. The AHB in 2022 reported supporting 19,000 people, was active in 28 local authorities and so on. Over a period of four or five years, more than €100 million was given. Does Mr. Graham or one of his colleagues have an up-to-date figure? I will not waste time on it.</p>

          <p eId="para_330">The task force was set up in 2019. By December 16, they are finally asking the question what are the obstacles. One of the major obstacles is infrastructure. Only one. Policies is also an obstacle. It took them five years under the remit of two different chairs to set up and ask what were the obstacles. The Department has a seat on the task force. I follow that closely and the figures are all going in the wrong direction. I do not want to be parochial. Housing is absolutely the most pressing need but Galway is a pressing example of targets being set by the Department and council but not being met. There was also underfunding. Funding was not used for retrofit and many other things. This issue raises many questions and I would like to get the opportunity to ask them.</p>

          <p eId="para_332">I will probably be a little different from some of my colleagues who have already contributed. I want to discuss the collapse of the public-private partnerships, PPPs. We all know of a bundle of PPPs, involving almost 500 social homes in Dublin city, Wicklow, Kildare and Sligo, was opened for tender two years ago. I think it was around nine months ago that the preferred bidder was notified and started to prepare to go on site, hiring staff, ordering materials and undertaking site-enabling works. I believe that full construction was due to commence in two weeks' time and two weeks ago, out of the blue, the Minister, Deputy James Browne, wrote to the PPP Co. project board collapsing the bid. This has effectively put the delivery of these homes and other homes in the forthcoming bundles 4 and 5 at risk. What I cannot really understand is that if the bundle was so bad that Government could not proceed with it, why it did not inform the bidders of this fact nine months ago. There is a real possibility of litigation here. It is understood that upwards of €8 million has been spent by the developers between procurement, architectural design and site-readying works. Not only is it causing lengthy delays in the delivery of much-needed homes, it will also potentially impact 1,400 jobs. We are in the midst of a housing crisis and this will significantly impact the much-needed delivery of homes that the witnesses have been speaking about throughout the meeting. Will the Secretary General explain why the plug was pulled on this at the eleventh hour? </p>

          <p eId="para_333">It was decided by the Minister not to proceed to contract award because the costs were considered too high in this case. The intention now is to seek to deliver those homes by an alternative funding route, but under the PPP model the cost was considered to be too high. </p>

          <p eId="para_352"> I want to come back to the issue of the Peter McVerry Trust. I did not comment on this earlier because I was hoping to get into it at this stage of the meeting. I agree completely with my colleagues. It is totally unacceptable that the trust refused to come before the committee today. It almost went bankrupt last summer. From what I can see, the core issue was the use of capital funding to subsidise day-to-day running costs and the trust has been very vocal in that regard. However, running up a liability of €20 million is outrageous. While we have questions to pose to the trust, it is not here today. I have not doubt that the committee will actively pursue the trust. We have all been united in our calls for representatives of the trust to come in here. The Department and the Government also have questions to answer, especially in the way deficit funding, competitive tendering and departmental oversight created the context in which the Peter McVerry Trust could behave in the way it did. It is my understanding that issues regarding the deficit-funding model were highlighted by other homeless service providers to the Department, going back as far as 2020. Where was the departmental oversight as the Peter McVerry Trust was racking up the liabilities that almost bankrupted it? It is pretty evident that there was no oversight to the extent that was required. </p>

          <p eId="para_353">The Department distributes its funding through the local authorities and they procure the services. They engage in the contracts, the service-level agreements and the tendering for those services. In terms of our funding model, we operate with the local authorities on this. Mr. Kelly will come in on this. </p>

          <p eId="para_354">Regarding the Deputy's comments on oversight, one of the issues looked at by the Department, in light of this, was a review of the funding arrangements. As the Secretary General said, our payments are funnelled through local authorities. They organise homeless services on a regional basis. We have a management group in each region and a consultative committee, which includes the local authorities and other State agencies. Those groups are responsible for deciding how local authorities need to deliver emergency services, homeless services and service-related health supports. </p>
          <p eId="para_355"> I will go back to some of the issues the Deputy referred to that have become prominent in some of the discourse after the issues at the Peter McVerry Trust. It became apparent that some NGOs were including fundraising income in tender costs. One of the things we have looked at with the CCMA - the review was led by the CCMA but the Department participated - was to change that procedure so that the State would fully fund all services and not require local approved housing bodies, AHB, to provide supplementary income. That will improve the situation. </p>
          <p eId="para_356"> We have made a couple of other changes which I think are really important and they have been approved by the Minister recently. The first one is to look at the overhead costs faced by AHBs. To manage its services effectively, each AHB needs an overhead of finance function and an oversight function and as we see at the Peter McVerry Trust, ensuring compliance with regulations, for example. That overhead cost will be increased. It was 5% under the old arrangements and it will be increased to support the central functions of AHBs. It will ensure that they operate effectively and that they are managed effectively. </p>
          <p eId="para_357"> Another one of the main things we will do is fund maintenance. Previously, one of the concerns raised by AHBs was that the funding arrangements in place with local authorities did not allow for repairs or maintenance to be done on emergency accommodation. It is obviously really important that these facilities are maintained to provide quality emergency accommodation and that they meet all the safety requirements. With this review, we are looking at a number of changes but three of the key ones are ensuring that we fully fund services. We never required AHBs to fund, but the nature of some of the arrangements in place-----</p>

Leaving that aside, the issue was, as the Deputy mentioned, that some fundraising income was supplementing State funding. Under the revised arrangements, we will fully fund the cost of the contract and the cost of service provision. We will provide an improved overhead cost and improved funding to support the maintenance of facilities. </p>

          <p eId="para_360">In the part of the review by the CCMA in relation to tendering, was it noted that perhaps there were glaringly obvious undercuts in some tenders? For example, if there are five tenders and three of them are sitting at one bar and two of them are sitting drastically, 25% to 40%, lower, there is an issue. Has it been noted and cited in the report that this needs to be included in the oversight going forward? </p>

          <p eId="para_361">In regard to procurement and the nature of any public money, local authority expenditure or Exchequer expenditure, there is an onus to get value for money.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">Some organisations will provide different services for different costs. However, during the work of the oversight group, it became very apparent that the Peter McVerry Trust was not being reimbursed for the actual costs, whether through underbidding or not realising the full costs of the service. That is probably one of the issues. We do not know the extent to which this was happening but following the review, we think it is prudent to make sure that we fully fund services.</p>

The position is that even if the council was to undertake to carry out commitments this year, it is probable that quite a number of those will not complete this year.

It is not necessarily the case that the funding will be provided in 2025 for a lot of the acquisitions that will happen in the latter part of this year.

There is a Charities Regulator. It is an AHB and there is an AHB regulator, although that regulator was probably in its early stages at that particular time. There is an overall regulatory structure in place even at that very high level. The changes we have made recently are particularly in response to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report in terms of the actions we took when we found ourselves dealing with a particularly urgent situation which threatened service provision to the public.

          <p eId="para_452">To go back, the situation in the trust is probably quite unique. At the time we made the decision around emergency funding, two regulatory investigations were under way. We now have the findings of those investigations, which have unearthed fairly significant failings in governance and financial management and issues around the oversight of the board. We have engaged with a lot of the other organisations, obviously. We have satisfied ourselves that they have all done a check on their own governance arrangements and are satisfied these types of risks do not exist. As the Secretary General mentioned, AHBRA was in its early days. The lessons learned from this investigation will inform the future development of that organisation. It has done a really strong job in identifying some of the issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_453"> One of the other issues when we talk about our oversight is that we do not get involved in the day to day or into the books. One of the things that we have done to try to satisfy ourselves that governance failures are being addressed is to work with the regulators and to look at the robustness of the oversight. We have an oversight group and we ensure the trust is complying with conditions. To go beyond that and to look at some of the more forensic examination, AHBRA has put consultants in to work with the trust to ensure compliance is being met. We have a dedicated company in there working directly with the trust, looking at the procedures and processes and making sure that they comply with AHBRA and the charities issues identified in the regulatory report. The structures we have put in place can give us some comfort that there is robust analysis of the failings and that steps are being taken to address them. </p>

          <p eId="para_454">While I accept the point about the operations and that the Department cannot be expected to oversee what is happening on a day-to-day basis, the public might have concern about Mr. Kelly’s point that this was a unique situation. The Peter McVerry Trust was, and hopefully in the future will be again, one of the most trusted brands out there for all the service it has given to support some of the most vulnerable people in Ireland, mostly in Dublin city. There is a concern that we are giving hundreds of millions of euro to other entities and essentially relying on those entities to be sufficiently robust from a governance standpoint. Where is the accountability from the taxpayer point of view? To use one example I am familiar with, the DRHE has some exceptionally hardworking people whose primary motivation is to ensure everyone in Dublin city has a bed to sleep in and that where they are sleeping, whether that is in emergency accommodation or otherwise, is of sufficient and appropriate standard and quality. It gets the money granted from the Department and gives it out. It too relies on the governance structures, etc., of these entities. </p>
          <p eId="para_455"> This is not the first time governance issues have arisen in homeless charities. Much more serious issues have arisen in other homeless charities. This question may be for the Secretary General. How do we assure the public that the hundreds of millions of euro which are being filtered through these homeless executives down to approved housing bodies or NGO entities are being spent appropriately and correctly and are going where we want them to go to support our most vulnerable? </p>

          <p eId="para_456">In the first instance, the value of the services provided by that organisation, and indeed all of these organisations, is huge in the context of the services people need provided to them. In respect of the situation that arose in this case, a lot of it seems to have arisen as a result of some of its practices and how some pricing was done. There are a range of issues. I need to choose my words carefully because some of the processes are ongoing. It is incredibly important, from a State perspective, that we put a governance structure in place insofar as we can as funders. As the Deputy said, we cannot go down right into the day-to-day operations of any entity. The State has regulatory bodies in place such as the Charities Regulator and the AHB regulator. There is compliance under the Companies Act as well as audits and local government audit services. NOAC does work around all the services with which local government engage. There is a whole suite of governance. Short of going down and being on the ground, you do what you can at an overall governance level to set standards and processes that you can put in place. When something goes wrong, you have to learn whatever lessons you can from it and try to incorporate those. That is the nature of trying to govern and control public expenditure or indeed just how any entity operates in the economy. </p>

I will appreciate their support in answering and getting through them quickly because the time goes quickly. First, and it is something that was raised earlier, Galway County Council is incredibly underfunded, similar to what Deputy Neville said about Kildare. A few years ago, Galway County Council received a presentation from Dr. Gerard Turley and Mr. Stephen McNena in which they proposed a new way of doing the equalisation model. Essentially what happens now is that the local property tax is sent back up to the Department to a central fund where it is equalised and separated out. The reality is that it is not very equal. It is not serving the constituents in Galway. Some counties are disproportionately benefitting compared with other counties. It is not an equal system on a <i>per capita</i> basis anyway. Maybe that is not the right way, either. Has any consideration been given at a Department level to a new way of funding local authorities? </p>

          <p eId="para_458">A review of the Local Government Fund is carried out every five years. The most recent changes took place in 2024. A variety of stakeholders are involved in that review in each case, from the local authorities themselves to councillors, NOAC and others, as far as I am aware. That is an opportunity to look at how the system operates. Some changes were brought forward the last time around. They were brought to the Minister and approved. That review is the opportunity to look at those issues.</p>

          <p eId="para_459">I appreciate that. While I know there was an increase in baseline funding for local authorities across the board in recent years, which was welcomed, as the Secretary General might know, it just did not go the full distance. A lot of local authorities are carrying out workforce plans. I see this across other State agencies as well. Does he think the carrying out of workforce plans and ultimately massively increasing staff head counts is producing greater synergies and results across our local authority network? I have a massive concern that we are hiring people for the sake of it as opposed to hiring with purpose.</p>

          <p eId="para_460">I very much hope that is not the case and I would not imagine it is, not to argue with the Deputy. We have a unit within the Department that works with the local authorities around the resourcing needs. It does some very good work. It is very important to us. Local government provides about 1,100 different services. We counted them I believe. That is a joke by the way; we did not actually count them. Just to show the scale of what local government does, 1,100 services is the accepted kind of thing. It is really important it has the resourcing, whether it is in planning, in trying to bring forward its own builds and housing units. The staffing itself is a matter for the local authority chief executives and how that works but we do work with them around the sanctioning and all of that as well.</p>

          <p eId="para_461">I appreciate that. The next thing I want to move on to is something I have been pursuing over the last few months across all Departments around public procurement. Essentially, I have been trying to establish whether every single Ministry can tell me right now how many contracts they have and are they on, under or over budget. Unfortunately, the Department of housing was not able to answer the three questions I put on these. I will be asking for the same report I would have got from other Departments from the Department of housing. Essentially, the answer I got was that the information sought was not readily available and its compilation would involve a disproportionate amount of time and work. I got the same answer on three separate parliamentary questions raised to the Ministry. I understand it is a very complex task and it might take a lot of time but the problem is if the Department is not able to tell us how many contracts it has and how much money is in them, then I definitely do not know. Therefore, it is vital that all Departments and Ministries are able to say how many contracts they have and how many are on, under, or over tender. This is not an exercise to say the Department is over budget on a few things. Of course the Department is over budget on a few things. We all know that but the key is if it is being tracked.</p>

          <p eId="para_462">On compliance for procurement, which the Comptroller and Auditor General audits, we generally have had very strong compliance around procurement. This is not to say there has not been an issue raised on occasion. This Department is vast, as I know the Deputy understands. The number of engagements we have and people have on our behalf really is vast. Our record in procurement has been strong in terms of audit and that is what the audit is there for. Genuinely, I was not aware of that response to the parliamentary questions but I can understand it. I would say to the Deputy that it was not given lightly or in any flippant way.</p>

          <p eId="para_463">No, and it is important for me to add context as well. The response did go on to tell me to contact the individual agencies under the aegis of the Department but, as Mr. Doyle can imagine, I might not have the resources in my office to do that whereas the Custom House might. However, I was able to get this information from other Departments. This can be done and it is probably a fruitful exercise for the Department as well as it is for the wider public. I will move on to my next question because I will be caught for time otherwise. Apologies, also on the public procurement, I have no doubt the Department's compliance with public procurement is good and well audited but what happens after the procurement? What measures does it have in place to track progress on projects and track costs as they happen? How does it manage that centrally? Is it managed centrally or does it leave it to the bodies underneath?</p>

With the breadth of the Department, there is everything from working with the local authority to deliver a bridge versus working with the local authority to deliver a suite of houses.

          <p eId="para_467">I thank Mr. Doyle. What is the average per unit cost of delivering social housing in 2023 compared to 2020 and what does Mr. Doyle feels are the primary cost drivers behind the increases? I understand there is obviously inflation in materials and labour, etc. but what is really driving this? Are regulations getting in the way of housing delivery?</p>

          <p eId="para_468">Mr. Benson will provide indicative figures in a moment. As to what has been driving it, we put Housing for All in place back in 2021. The number of headwinds that hit after that were enormous in terms of fallout post Covid and all of that. Inflation and rampant construction and materials inflation have been obvious factors which everyone has commented on. Another factor that often gets missed is the enormous increase in interest rates and what that has meant for the provision of housing, for the financing of housing for developers out there and for AHBs. A lot of our schemes under the cost-rental and affordability model had to be revised because when interest rates moved to the extent they did, many of those models did not work for some of those providers anymore. Those have been some of the really key drivers of cost.</p>

          <p eId="para_472">Yes. The size of schemes can affect average costs. We have about eight different delivery streams. They vary from something like a local authority Part 5 which is just under €300,000 in 2024 to a local authority construction project which was €340,000 and at turnkey which was €372,000. CALF construction, which is what the AHBs do, is €421,000. That is really because often they are doing apartments in Dublin city and other places which are a lot more expensive. They do vary. There is a considerable variation there and costs have risen significantly. We are all aware of the construction cost inflation.</p>

          <p eId="para_474">I suppose a lot of their schemes, particularly cost rental, have been built around an apartment model. We talk about the housing market a lot. I often feel we should be talking about a housing market and an apartment market and we do this within the Department. If you look over the last number of years and at what happened last year with output, and we talked about output numbers earlier on, houses increased but apartments fell. Therefore, if you look at both and track them on a graph, you will see housing continued to increase last year; it was the apartment piece that started to fall.</p>

          <p eId="para_475">Thank you. I have one last question on modular units. There is a huge opportunity for the country to deliver rapid-build modular units at scale. We have the companies, the capacity and the ability to build homes in factories and land them on-site with services on public land. Why did modular-unit costings jump from €200,000 to €442,000? The witnesses can correct me if my figures are wrong but it just seems like it ran away from the Department.</p>

          <p eId="para_476">I am not sure of those figures but I will say we have not been seeing cost savings across the board in the wider market. Modular construction is not cheaper yet. It is quicker and it is better for a lot of reasons but it is not quite cheaper yet. It is hoped that in the future we will see economies of scale in modular construction or modern methods of construction, as we prefer to term it, but there is very much an initiative right across government now to try to build that industry in Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_480">I thank all the witnesses for coming in today and for answering our questions. I am going to go back over the tenant in situ scheme. I know some of that ground has already been covered. We know that in 2023, there was an underspend of about €255 million generally for local authority housing. We know also that Dublin City Council gets 70% to 75% of the homeless budget and the majority of the homeless people are catered for in the city, yet, when it came to tenant in situ, we got 30% of the tenant in situ budget. Obviously, we know the narrative around tenant in situ is that it is used to prevent homelessness and it was doing that very effectively in Dublin. It also had the double benefit of increasing local authority housing stock. </p>
          <p eId="para_481">Where did that change of heart in the Department come from? Anecdotally, it came from the ether in the Department of housing that the tenant in situ scheme did not represent value for money and that it was effectively being shut down. I cannot see how it is not value for money. Inflationary measures do not really affect it. You are not dealing with increases or decreases in VAT or the costs of construction. It was a really good way of increasing the social housing stock. Where in the Department did the idea to gut the tenant in situ scheme come from?</p>

          <from> Mr. Graham Doyle<recordedTime time="2025-06-19T12:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_482">If the Deputy will forgive me, I do not accept that the tenant in situ scheme is being gutted. That is not happening at all. As a Department, we have focused as much as we possibly can on the construction of new homes, new supply and all of that. In the past five years, we have added 50,000 houses to the social housing stock in the country. Some 6,000 to 7,000 of those came through acquisition. The rest have come through building by local authorities and AHBs and own-build schemes. A certain amount has also come through leasing, which also involves new builds. The tenant in situ scheme is a matter of Government policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_483"> On the view within the Department, Departments will always have views and will always provide advice but the tenant in situ scheme is a matter of Government policy. The Government is determined to deliver on it so we are delivering on it within the context of the funding that can be made available for it. </p>

          <p eId="para_485">We believe the scheme has potentially strong value in the context of preventing homelessness in certain cases. It is not how the Deputy characterised it before. I can understand that but it is not a fair characterisation of where we are coming from. We are trying to strike a balance between the overall funding available and the pressure to deliver new supply in cases where acquisition is entirely appropriate.</p>

          <p eId="para_490">I will address that. Between 2013 and 2021, local authorities were engaged in shallow retrofit, which is effectively attic and wall insulation. In 2021, there was a commitment to upgrade to a higher standard of energy retrofit to try to get properties to a B2 rating to tie in with a Government commitment to have 500,000 houses reach that B2 rating by 2030. Of that figure, local authorities were to do 36,500. It required significant upskilling of local authority staff to get involved in that programme, to understand what needed to be done and to survey properties. The programme was a little slower to take off than we would have liked but to do more than 2,000 properties in 2021 from a standing start was still significant. Local authorities are now at a stage where they can do 2,500 comfortably. They may be able to do 3,000 this year depending on how things go and what kind of funding is available. It is just a question of building that skill set and that capacity within the local authorities to spend the money that is available. They are now in that process and we are in a good place.</p>

          <p eId="para_492">It is a matter of Government policy that the properties being funded reach the B2 standard. Local authorities have to meet that standard if they want to access the funding scheme. That comfort level is Government policy and must be met.</p>

          <p eId="para_493">I do not want to use up the Deputy's time but there was a full spend in 2024 so it has improved considerably. There are probably more than 35,000 properties in the local authority stock that already meet the B2 standard. That is the number I have in front of me but I believe it is an old number. Some 75,000 - those in the midlands bring it up to 80,000 - have had a shallow retrofit done previously. Everything we build now is of such a high standard from an energy perspective that the number meeting that higher energy rating - the 35,000 or whatever the bigger number is now - will increase.</p>

On Uisce Éireann, we hear from across the country, although probably less so in Dublin, that there are difficulties in accessing water treatment plants or water supply, which is delaying house development. While this is quite a broad question, with regard to the Department's role in overseeing Uisce Éireann, can it make any more direct interventions? Obviously, the Department cannot get involved in day-to-day cases but there is a real feeling that more needs to be done to push these projects forward.</p>

One of the things this is very much about is coalescing all of the different measures State entities take to activate housing supply, whether with regard to energy, water or access roads. It is about becoming more interventionist than ever before to coalesce all of the State's activities on some of the key sites that will deliver large numbers of houses over the coming years. That is one piece. </p>
          <p eId="para_496"> On our interaction with Uisce Éireann, we have worked with it quite a lot with regard to its focus on and interaction with housing.

The crisis in the Peter McVerry Trust did not arise overnight. This has really exposed a failure of oversight as much as a failure of governance. When millions of euros of public money are involved, we need real-time financial checks, independent audits and proper board standards, not just trust and hope. I have listened to the Secretary General here today and, from what I have heard, he and his Department are absolving themselves of all responsibility for the improper spending of millions of euros of public money provided by the Department.

          <p eId="para_527">I am also going to be a little parochial and talk about the tenant in situ scheme. There has been an underspend of local authority spending in the amount of €225 million, as my colleague mentioned earlier, yet the tenant in situ scheme in Dublin Fingal, the area I represent, is effectively closed for 2025. A total of €20 million was allocated for second-hand purchases. Some 65 properties have been purchased to date and eight are sale agreed. That means Fingal County Council cannot commit or even entertain the tenant in situ scheme for any other tenants who have received notices of termination and are at serious risk of homelessness. It is a real issue. Fingal has one of the longest housing lists in the country. I am getting queries every day from tenants who are terrified and from landlords who are leaving the market and worried about their tenants. They want to ensure their tenants are looked after. To be fair to Fingal County Council, it has no more money to allocate. It cannot entertain even a conversation about the tenant in situ scheme for the rest of 2025. Is there anything I can say to these people?</p>

          <p eId="para_528">I thank the Deputy. I need to make the point that the tenant in situ scheme is a last resort for local authorities to prevent families who have received notices of termination from a private landlord falling into homelessness. It is not the only option available to local authorities. They have numerous options in such situations. They can speak to the landlords, try to find alternative private rental accommodation or try to find a casual vacancy in their own housing stocks, and they always have casual vacancies. They are building a significant number of houses and there are tenancies in those. AHBs have properties.</p>

          <p eId="para_538">We have given local authorities comfort that there is a Government commitment to second-hand acquisitions and the tenant in situ scheme, and that there will be funding in 2026, 2027 and 2028. It is natural if you begin discussions with a landlord at this time of year or in the coming weeks and months that the conveyancing will not happen in 2025. It could be 2026 before that conveyancing completes and funding is required. The issue of funding is only one aspect of it. If they want to pursue the option of the acquisition of a property, local authorities must be prepared to enter that acquisition with the expectation that it will take three, four, six or nine months, in some cases, to complete conveyance and the funding will not be required in 2025. It will be 2026 before it is required and there will be funding available to meet the requirement.</p>

          <p eId="para_540">We have not, but we have said we do not expect it will be hugely different from what they have for 2025. As I mentioned earlier, the NDP review is ongoing. Until such time as we have clarity on what the funding will be for the Department for that period, we cannot give local authorities full certainty. However, there is clarity at least.</p>

          <p eId="para_541">To be fair to the local authorities, that means they are very limited in the number of tenants they can entertain, even if we are talking about closing a sale next year, because they do not know the exact amount they are going to be funded. The minute tenants hear that they might be in for the tenant in situ scheme, it gives them hope. They are absolutely relying on it. To be fair, the local authorities have to be careful about how they entertain such requests.</p>

          <p eId="para_542">I fully understand that but I would make the point that in 2025, we started the year with €60 million for acquisitions. We have €325 million this year. I expect it will be something similar next year, but who knows? We will see how the NDP works out. There was no issue with making commitments in 2024 to be carried into 2025 even though the funding envelope for the entire country contained only €60 million. Those are the conversations we are having with local authorities about the need to understand that the funding they are looking for is not needed in 2025 but will probably be needed in 2026 to complete those conveyances. The scheme should be open and operational. We are engaging with local authorities to try to overcome difficulties, misunderstandings or concerns about future funding and commitments, and honouring the commitments into which they enter. I appreciate and accept that there are issues in the implementation but we will get them sorted.</p>

          <p eId="para_670">In respect of a project on which work had essentially commenced and on which the plug was pulled, we have no timeframe for the commencement or delivery of these units and the knock-on consequences for the other bundles despite the fact that we are in a housing crisis.</p>

          <p eId="para_673">To clarify, we have said, as a Department, that these units will be delivered but we all have to respect the fact that we are in a process at the moment. As the Cathaoirleach himself said, it is only two weeks since the decision was made. There is a timeline and a process around PPPs where the consortium can exercise rights to challenge decisions and everything else. We have to respect that process and let it take its course. At the same time, we are discussing with the various local authorities how they might bring them forward. There are options available to them. We are in a much better place in terms of the upskilling that is happening in local authorities. It would be wrong to start speculating on times or periods, given the process that has to take place.</p>

          <p eId="para_674">I certainly will not speculate in terms of potential litigation. I am sure that is factored into the decision-making process within the Department as to whether there is the potential. I will not stray into that field at the moment because that could potentially further delay any delivery of those badly needed units.</p>
          <p eId="para_675"> I want to touch on an IT-related issue which, unfortunately, we have seen become prevalent across a number of Departments in recent times. I want to touch on the Residential Tenancies Board and an issue that has been flagged by the Comptroller and Auditor General going back over a number of years. It concerns an opinion on the financial statements from 2023 by the Comptroller and Auditor General relating to an online tenancy registration system that the RTB had sought to use back in 2021, I believe. Is Mr. Doyle aware of that?</p>

          <p eId="para_683">That issue goes back a number of years. It was a very live issue at that point in time. Mr. Kelly's predecessor as assistant secretary in that area was dealing with this. Would the Cathaoirleach mind if I came back to him on it?</p>

          <p eId="para_684">It goes back a number of years but it was highlighted again in the accounts for 2023 by the Comptroller and Auditor General. In the last quarter of 2023, there were still outstanding issues and there are still issues in terms of the full implementation of that IT system. I would be interested to see what control or oversight, if any, the Department had in relation to that.</p>

          <p eId="para_686">I might come in briefly on that point. The RTB has put a lot of focus on the governance of IT systems. The board has a subcommittee looking specifically at IT. The Department’s head of IT is represented on that committee so we are giving it very strong support. The board also brought in specific expertise as part of recruitment to the board last year relating to IT. It is something the board is very conscious of. The board wants to make sure the IT systems are fit for purpose for the public, both tenants and landlords. I know it is a real priority for the chief executive who took over last year.</p>

          <p eId="para_687">I would appreciate any information the Department has on it. An overspend of €5.3 million is an extraordinary amount of money.</p>
          <p eId="para_688"> I have a final question regarding IT. Are there any other bodies, such as approved housing bodies or anything like that, where there would be similar issues, either currently or in recent years, in terms of the implementation of IT systems?</p>

          <p eId="para_689">No. Where it comes to the local authorities, for example, I know there is very strong peer review of IT systems from within and outside the sector. In my experience, the governance has been strong around IT.</p>

          <p eId="para_692">Mr. Doyle might have a look because the approved housing bodies are in receipt of an enormous amount of public funding.

We have approved a huge number of projects in the last three weeks and that is effectively on the back of the €750 million extra that we got. We are prioritising projects for 2025 delivery in terms of approvals. We have some projects, a small number, that are not being progressed and are for 2027, 2028 and 2026 delivery. They are not on-site. They are within the system and being held up. They may be the ones that people talk about but they are very small in number.

The big work that is being done at the moment which delays re-letting is not necessary at this point when a property is vacant. If the Department gives extra funding, that extra work will be done and that means extra works for contractors and extra time for the property to be done up.</p>

To give some examples, for a family hub, which might be family accommodation, it is an average of €57,000 per year nationally, so it is very expensive. Looking at single people in private emergency accommodation, it costs around €30,000 per year. The costs are very significant. </p>

          <p eId="para_740">Picking up on that point, I am a proud Galwegian and Galway is a disaster with regard to empty properties owned by the local authority. I spent 17 years as a local councillor and I followed this up. In my area alone there are two houses that have been vacant for longer than five years. I can think of an estate that has been empty for 15 years and I can see absolutely no reason for it. I will not waste my time. I am highlighting it and telling the witnesses about it. I have no idea why this is happening. These properties have not been vacant for one or two years. Somebody dies and then the house is left empty for more than five years. It is there and we have highlighted this point over and over.</p>
          <p eId="para_741"> I will make one or two general points and then ask very specific questions. It is no reflection on the witnesses, but it is very difficult to be here as, for me, the policies the Government is pursuing which the Department has to implement are simply not working. People in Galway are waiting for somewhere between 15 and 20 years for a house. I will take the opportunity to put it on the record. We have missed all of our targets. We have so many entities and schemes now that it is impossible to keep up with them. I tried to count the schemes and I cannot keep up with them. </p>
          <p eId="para_742"> One simple part of the solution is to resource the local authorities and allow public housing to be built on public land, full stop. That is an essential part of the solution. I feel there is an absolute snobbery or something else preventing that. Public housing has to be seen for what it is. The Housing Commission has set a target for the Department, or not the Department, for us, of 20% or thereabouts as essential. Will Mr. Doyle comment on that? He might not have time to do so. I just despair over and over.</p>

          <p eId="para_744">I appreciate that. I was going to come back to that. I appreciate efforts are being made but the crisis was created by not building social housing back in 2009. I do not know where the mechanism was for the Department or the local authorities to come back and say not to do that as it would be an absolute disaster. Not alone did we stop building housing, the idiotic HAP scheme was brought in and we now cannot get rid of it overnight. It stated a person was adequately housed if he or she got a house in the private sector paid for with taxpayers' money and with rent tied to it. This is no reflection on the tenant. It is a reflection on the housing assistance payment policy that was brought in and was absolutely guaranteed to make the crisis worse. </p>

Listening to Mr. Benson's response, you would think there was no issue with delays. Maybe there is not but statistics show that since August 2024 there has been a growing delay in social and affordable housing stage 1 approvals for local authorities and approved housing bodies. That is a fact. Turnaround times have gone from six to eight weeks, on average, to 12 to 24 weeks. That would suggest there is a problem. This is inevitably delaying the commencement and delivery of much-needed social and affordable homes, as has been referenced by colleagues. Can we cut it down to numbers? Can the Secretary General confirm the number of delayed applications awaiting stage 1 approval at this moment in time?</p>

          <p eId="para_790"> On the wider piece around responsibility and accountability, it was rightly suggested that responsibility does not just lie with the Minister. He is not approving schemes or out laying blocks. He is not building the houses. We have to look at accountability more widely in the Department. Where there are blockages, are those people being held accountable? If we have an issue with the ESB, the grid, Irish Water or planning, the individuals with those levels of responsibility need to be held to account more, either within the Department or in a forum like this. We can yield better results by letting those people know we want to hold them to the highest account and also want to celebrate them when they deliver more units and more housing and exceed targets. </p>

          <p eId="para_799">I appreciate that. I move to my second question. I know Deputy Connolly is gone now but in Galway we have not wanted for resources behind the Galway city ring road. The only thing holding it up has been objectors. I want to highlight that point. Millions have been spent on planning, design and consultation. More planners will not get the ring road built. It will take a decision by An Bord Pleanála to go ahead with the project. Then the local authorities and stakeholders can step in and make sure the project is a success. It was suggested we did not have the resources or the planning and that objectors were not the problem, but objectors are the sole reason we are 20-plus years waiting to see even a shovel go in the ground for the ring road.</p>

          <p eId="para_839">Yes. There is one chief fire officer in Scotland, which has a larger population. The point I am making is related to value for money. Does Mr. Doyle think the duplication of roles and services across the State, in comparison with the likes of Scotland, is value for money? Is having that many fire authorities and that many chief fire officers value for money? The follow-on point is that the number of assistant chief fire officers in this State is between 40 and 60, in comparison with Scotland, which is between two and four, I think. Does Mr. Doyle think that is value for money?</p>

          <p eId="para_845">I will give the example of a fire authority in Wicklow, which procured a considerable amount of equipment in, I think, 2020. It cost tens, if not hundreds, of thousand of euro. That equipment has yet to be used. The latest correspondence I got from the chief fire officer in Wicklow said that, after I had highlighted this issue, they are awaiting guidance at a national level for the use of the equipment. That says to me there is a complete lack of oversight of procurement rules. This issue is replicated across the board, as far as I can see, in all local authorities, which seem to have their own independence regarding procurement of materials for the fire service. Is there no oversight from the Department? It is purely the LGMA accounting?</p>

          <p eId="para_850">There is no uniformity in terms of approach in respect of training, procurement or any of these issues in any of the fire authorities. That is the real problem.

          <p eId="para_858">No. I think, if I am correct, there was full spending in 2024. We might have been a few hundred euro short.</p>

          <p eId="para_859">That is an improvement, and it is welcome. However, that expenditure does not go far enough. Several members have been parochial, and I will be parochial too. The number of houses in County Wicklow retrofitted last year was approximately 100. That is nowhere near the level required. I am dealing with many local authority tenants who are experiencing real financial hardship in terms of energy poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_860"> There are also the responsibilities we have in terms of reaching our climate objectives. I would be concerned in this regard. Again, this is a different debate to have with the Minister. However, I welcome that the 2024 targets have been met and that the money allocated has been spent.</p>
          <p eId="para_861"> On estate regeneration and refurbishment, I think there was also an underspend. Only €37.2 million out of a budget of €50 million was spent on estate regeneration and refurbishment. Again, I look at my constituency. A pilot project was rolled out several years ago in one estate, Ashlawn Court, in Bray. Only 18 of the 248 houses in that estate underwent regeneration. Any time I raise this issue, I am consistently told there is no funding to progress and complete that refurbishment. We know the benefits of and carrying out this work. Why is there underspending on this scale under this heading?</p>

          <p eId="para_862">The €50 million allocated in 2023 concerned ongoing activity around several projects. The Cork city northwest quarter regeneration plan, the Limerick regeneration plan and the regeneration plans for Tralee in Kerry and Cranmore in Sligo were the four that accounted for the €37 million funding that year. Our estimate and our information at the start of the year – back at budget time – would have been that €50 million was required. The difference would have either been moved to another delivery stream or carried forward for future spending. We try to work with these regeneration projects and provide the funding for them as is required. There was underspending that year, however.</p>

          <p eId="para_863">That is disappointing, given the necessity of the work involved. I referred to the example of a particular estate in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_864"> Deputy Connolly mentioned the staffing in the planning sections of local authorities, which is critically important. Again, from the perspective of County Wicklow, l have regular and ongoing engagement with the housing staff of the county council there. They have told me that an application for 18 additional housing staff has been submitted. This requirement relates to several areas, including homelessness and a person to deal with disability issues. The council has no one dedicated to deal with that critical area in terms of housing. I refer also to social workers. In terms of an application like that for an increase in staff for local authorities under major pressure to deliver, would it go to the Department or to the Department of public expenditure and reform?</p>

          <p eId="para_865">In terms of the overall level of funding, work was done with the CCMA several years ago to identify needs in the areas of social housing and affordable housing. We would then negotiate with the Department of public expenditure and reform to determine how much funding can be provided. We would then provide that funding to the local authorities based on an agreed level of resourcing within whatever that envelope is. That is how the process works. As a Department, we are very conscious of the need to have people who can deliver, especially if we are talking about own-build construction projects in local authorities. It is necessary to have people there to bring those projects forward and initiate them. As a result, we are back looking at this issue again. Mr. Benson has something to add.</p>

          <p eId="para_866">A working group has been established by the LGMA to look at staffing for housing services across the country. It is an add-on to what happened in 2021. Some 250 extra staff were provided in 2022 in the area of social housing. The requirement is again being looked at in light of the growth in and ambition of the targets and everything else. We are hoping the work will be concluded by the third quarter of this year to give us an idea of what the request is and if the skill mix is correct. It may not be numbers, but so many different skills.</p>

          <p eId="para_868">I expect a submission will then come from the LGMA on behalf of all 31 local authorities regarding what they need to drive the build, acquisition and leasing programmes. There is other work to be done across all those other programmes the Cathaoirleach talked about, and that group will do that work too. It is about prioritising the build, acquisition and leasing aspect. Obviously, that would then be the subject of a discussion with the Department public expenditure and reform regarding funding those staff and getting them recruited. I am not aware of the submission the Cathaoirleach referred to in relation to Wicklow County Council. If it relates to social housing stock, I certainly have not seen it and am not aware of it being in. I would be interested if there is something in and I ask the Cathaoirleach to let me know.</p>

          <p eId="para_871">When I hear a local authority asking for additional staff to deal with homelessness and other areas, I appreciate the huge personal impact dealing with homeless families has on the staff of local authorities. It is tough and takes its toll. When there is a shortage of staff, however, it not only puts pressure on the delivery of the critical service in terms of homelessness, it also puts staff under major additional pressure. I will get further information and I ask Mr. Benson to look into this matter as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_872"> I want to follow up on a topic Deputy McGrath raised. I refer to vacant local authority houses, boarded-up houses, voids, etc. Whatever they are called, these are houses that people experiencing extremely difficult situations are being deprived of. We have all the figures, and I will give them to the witnesses, for County Wicklow. There are 108 boarded-up houses in the county. When I say they are boarded up, I mean that they are literally boarded up. This puts an additional cost on the local authority because it has to hire the metal shutters that keep those houses boarded up, which is ludicrous. As we speak, there are 108 boarded-up houses in County Wicklow. Of those, six have been boarded up for more than five years.</p>
          <p eId="para_873"> When I speak to the staff in the county council - who do extraordinary work in terms of turning those units around and who have met all their targets - they tell me they are hamstrung regarding what they can do because of the allocation of funding from the Department. When I hear it is expected to turn around some of these units for an average of €11,000 and I look at the average cost in 2022 of €21,000, how can a figure as low as €11,000 be justified?</p>
          <p eId="para_874">Much of the housing stock that is being returned to use is 40, 50 or 60 years old. Bringing it up to the necessary standard will cost considerably more than that amount. How does Mr. Doyle justify such a low-----</p>

          <p eId="para_875">It is an average, and it is in the context of quick turnarounds. The Deputy is talking about something that has been boarded up for a period and that requires a different level of investment. Such a property would not be subject to that €11,000. I am surprised to hear that funding would be an issue when it comes to vacancy because we are keen to see vacant units filled. We are providing a great deal of funding under our vacancy programmes outside local authority housing, so we certainly want to be doing it in local authority housing.</p>

          <p eId="para_881">There are a variety of circumstances. A quick turnaround of a void, which is what we were talking about earlier, is something requiring a minimal spend of an average of €11,000.

        <speech by="#JohnBrady" eId="spk_1">
          <from> An Cathaoirleach<recordedTime time="2025-05-22T09:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_12">We have received apologies from Deputy Joanna Byrne. You are all welcome. I remind all those in attendance to ensure that their mobile phones are on silent mode or switched off.</p>
          <p eId="para_13"> Before we proceed, I have a few housekeeping matters to go through, as follows. I remind members of the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex. Members of the committee attending remotely must do so from within the precincts of Leinster House. This is due to the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the place where Parliament has chosen to sit. In this regard, I ask any members participating via Microsoft Teams, prior to making their contributions, to confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> Before we proceed with the rest of the meeting, members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice and ruling of the Cathaoirleach to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. Members are also reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 226 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies. We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, who is a permanent witness to the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_15"> The public business before us is as follows: accounts and financial statements and correspondence. The first item of business is accounts and financial statements. No sets of accounts and financial statements were laid between 12 and 16 May 2025.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> The second item of business is correspondence. As previously agreed, items that were not flagged for discussion for this meeting will be dealt with in accordance with the proposed actions that have been circulated. Decisions taken by the committee in relation to correspondence are recorded in the minutes of the committee’s meetings and published on the committee’s web page. The first category under which items have been flagged is category B, correspondence from accounting officers or Ministers and follow-up from Committee of Public Accounts meetings.</p>
          <p eId="para_17"> No. R0004B, from Ms Madeline Delaney, chief executive, Charities Regulator, dated 13 November 2024, provides follow-up information requested by the committee at the meeting of 17 October 2024. Unfortunately, Deputy Farrelly had to attend another meeting. He flagged this item for discussion. If it is acceptable to members, I propose to defer it until next week's meeting. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_18"> No. R0005B, correspondence from Mr. Christy Duffy, chief executive, City of Dublin Education and Training Board, dated 14 November 2024, provides follow-up information requested by the committee in relation to non-compliant procurement. It was the practice of the Committee of Public Accounts of the Thirty-third Dáil to seek an explanation for instances of non-compliant procurement disclosed in the accounts presented to it. This was flagged by me. I am happy to defer it until next week because it ties in with other correspondence that has been flagged by Deputy Farrell and we can have a conversation about them all next week. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> No. R0008B, from Ms Bernie McNally, Secretary General, Department of Education, dated 15 November 2024, provides follow-up information requested by the committee in relation to non-compliant procurement. This was also flagged by Deputy Farrelly. I propose that we defer it until next week's meeting. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_20"> No. R0022B, from Mr. Denis Leamy, chief executive, Cork Education and Training Board, dated 19 November 2024, provides follow-up information requested by the committee in relation to non-compliant procurement. This was flagged by me, as Cathaoirleach. I will return to ETBs and a proposed course of action in private session. For now, I propose to note and publish this item. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_21"> No. R0033B, from Mr. Paul Turner, director of organisation support and development, Dublin and Dún Laoghaire Education and Training Board, dated 22 November 2024, provides follow-up information requested by the committee in relation to non-compliant procurement. Again, I flagged this item. I propose to deal with this in private session and in our work programme. For now, I propose to note and publish this item. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> No. R0034B, from Mr. Colm O'Reardon, Secretary General, Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science dated 22 November 2024, provides follow-up information requested by the committee in relation to late submission of accounts for the Grangegorman Development Agency, the National College of Art and Design and SOLAS. It was the practice of the Committee of Public Accounts of the Thirty-third Dáil to seek an explanation for the late laying of accounts and financial statements of bodies under the committee’s remit. This was flagged by Deputy Farrelly. I propose to defer it to next week's meeting. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> No. R0036B, from Mr. Brendan Gleeson, Secretary General, Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, dated 25 November 2024, provides follow-up information requested by the committee in relation to non-compliant procurement. It is proposed to note and publish this item but to redact personal data related to individuals. Is that agreed? Deputy Geoghegan flagged this item for discussion.</p>

          <p eId="para_24">To clarify, there is only one item in the correspondence that I want to follow up on. Do I flag that and we deal with it later? How is it done?</p>

          <p eId="para_26">Everything is itemised in terms of where there are breaches of public procurement. One item is storage services for €127,000. I would like further information about that. It is the only one that did not list a company, what is was or where it was located.</p>

          <p eId="para_31">In the appendix supplied, two contracts were outside public procurement, for €300,000 and €400,000, with Ernst and Young. It does not explain what the contracts were for. It just refers to "experience with related work and need for consistent approach".</p>
          <p eId="para_32">It would be to explain to us what those two items were.</p>

No. R0045 B from Mr. Hugh Creegan, chief executive National Transport Authority, dated 16 December 2024, provides correspondence to the committee on the national train control centre project. It is proposed to note and publish this item but to redact personal data related to individuals. Deputy Farrelly has flagged this item for discussion.

          <p eId="para_41">Okay. I also flagged this. I suggest we also seek further information on the arbitration process and get an up-to-date cost of that process. We know the initial process cost a considerable amount of money. We should get that information and, regarding the OPW, get some information on the cost of completing the report on the bike shed which was carried out by Deloitte. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>

          <p eId="para_48">I remind all those in attendance to ensure their mobile phones are in silent mode or switched off. The committee has elected Deputy McAuliffe as Leas-Chathaoirleach. I congratulate the Deputy and look forward to working closely with him over the course of our important work ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_49"> I will explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence. The evidence of witnesses physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant both to the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege. This means that witnesses have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting. However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure that this privilege is not abused. Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory regarding an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction. Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory regarding an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_50"> The Comptroller and Auditor General is a permanent witness to the committee. He is accompanied today by Ms Paula O'Connor, deputy director of audit at the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General. This morning, we will engage with representatives from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board to examine its financial statements from 2023. We are joined by the following representatives from the board: Mr. David Gunning, chief executive officer; Mr. Phelim Devine, project director; and Dr. Emma Curtis, medical director. We will also engage with representatives from Children's Health Ireland to examine its financial statements from 2023. We are joined by the following representatives from Children's Health Ireland: Ms Lucy Nugent, chief executive officer; Mr. John Fitzpatrick, interim chief financial officer; Ms Julia Lewis, transformation director; and Dr. Ike Okafor, clinical director.</p>
          <p eId="para_51">We are also joined by the following officials from the Department of Health: Ms Tracey Conroy, assistant secretary, acute hospitals oversight and performance; and Mr. Derek Tierney, assistant secretary, health infrastructure. From the HSE we have Mr. Patrick Lynch, national director of planning and performance. All the witnesses are very welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_52"> Before I call on the Comptroller and Auditor General for his opening statement, I would like to a make a comment regarding the briefing material provided for this meeting. Last October, the previous Committee of Public Accounts expressed disappointment and concern when a meeting with Children's Health Ireland, CHI, and the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board, NPHDB, due to be held on 7 November could not proceed because the accountable persons for both organisations were unavailable. My welcome to them this morning is a belated one. In its invitations to both CHI and NPHDB to attend this meeting, the committee requested that briefing material be provided by end of business on Friday last, 16 May. Some documents were received on Friday but some briefing material was only provided late on Tuesday. Similarly, there was a request that opening statements be provided at least 48 hours before this morning's engagement. One of the statements arrived less than 24 hours before the meeting and the other arrived on Tuesday evening. It is the expectation of this committee that witnesses provide comprehensive briefing material and opening statements in good time in order that members have time to analyse them before meetings. Not doing so is unacceptable and disrespectful to the committee. As we will hear this morning, deadlines are really important. As representatives of their organisations, I expect the witnesses know the importance of deadlines. This committee does not have a lax relationship with deadlines. I wanted to make that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_53"> I call the Comptroller and Auditor General to make his opening statement.</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_21">
          <from> Mr. Seamus McCarthy<recordedTime time="2025-05-22T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_54">As members are aware, the NPHDB is responsible for the planning, design, construction and fit-out of the new national children's hospital's facilities. In addition to the main hospital at the St. James's campus in Dublin, where construction is ongoing, two satellite paediatric outpatient and urgent care centres located at Tallaght and Connolly hospitals have been completed and are now functioning under the management of Children's Health Ireland. A number of parallel subprojects, outside the remit of the development board, will be required to integrate and transfer staff, equipment and services into the new facilities at St. James's to bring them into operation. These subprojects are being progressed by Children's Health Ireland, which will manage and deliver care in the new hospital and the satellite centres into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_55"> I turn to the NPHDB's financial statements for 2023. The development board is funded by Oireachtas grants, provided via the Health Service Executive. In 2023, the grant funding provided amounted to €156 million. This matched the expenditure incurred by the board in 2023, meaning the financial statements record a break-even outcome. As outlined in note 2, total accumulated capital development costs incurred by the board to the end of 2023 amounted to €1.396 billion, inclusive of the costs of developing the satellite centres. This includes payments to the main contractor, BAM, as well as the board's own costs in respect of administration, project design, and project monitoring and oversight.</p>
          <p eId="para_56"> Note 12 to the financial statements discloses that the board has been notified of a very large number of additional payment claims by the main contractor. The note outlines the structures in place for the resolution of such claims, including determination by the employer's representative or a project board through a conciliation process and, ultimately, if required, in the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_57"> In my report, I drew attention to note 13, which discloses that in May 2024, the standing conciliator issued a recommendation that the board pay €107.6 million, excluding VAT, to BAM in respect of a claim for critical delay events on the construction project over the period from December 2019 to February 2023. When VAT of 13.5% is added, this brings the recommended payment value to around €122 million. This is not included in the capitalised development costs of €1.396 billion. The development board considers that very little of this claim is valid and has appealed the conciliation recommendation to the High Court. In order to do so, it was required to pay BAM the full amount recommended. The funding to make the payment was provided from the Health Vote, via the HSE. If, in due course, it is found by the court that BAM is not entitled to some or all of the payment, the company will be required to repay that amount plus interest to the development board. The potential repayment is underpinned by a bond purchased by BAM.</p>
          <p eId="para_58"> Note 8 indicates that the value of the development capital spending commitments outstanding at the end of 2023 stood at €235.2 million. Combined with the development costs incurred to the reporting date, this indicates a projected overall development cost of a minimum of €1.63 billion. This exceeded the budget of €1.443 billion approved for the board in December 2018. Note 13 explains that in February 2024, the approved budget available to the board was increased to €1.88 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_59"> The 2023 financial statements were certified by me on 17 December 2024. My opinion was qualified on the basis that in complying with the standard direction of the Minister for Health, the board's financial statements account for pensions only as they become payable. Otherwise, in my view, the financial statements present a true and fair view in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 102.</p>
          <p eId="para_60"> Children's Health Ireland was established as a legal entity on 1 January 2019 through an amalgamation of the existing children's hospitals located at Crumlin, Temple Street and Tallaght. It operates as one of the section 38 agencies supported by grant funding from the HSE. CHI's financial statements for 2023 recognise income totalling just under €589 million. Recurrent and capital grant funding received amounted to €541 million. Retained staff superannuation contributions amounted to a further €18.4 million. Income from patient charges amounted to just under €14.4 million, and other income, including donations and fundraising, was €14.4 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_61"> Expenditure for 2023 totalled €580 million. This comprised €406 million spent on pay and pensions and €174 million on non-pay. After transfers of a net €16 million to capital reserves, the financial statements indicate there was a deficit for the year of €7.8 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_62"> The 2023 financial statements were certified by me on 1 November 2024. As with the development board, the financial statements were qualified on the basis that in complying with the direction of the Minister for Health, Children's Health Ireland accounts for pensions only as they become payable.</p>
          <p eId="para_63"> Separately, the audit report draws attention to non-compliant procurement undertaken by CHI, losses incurred due to out-of-time claims for payment being rejected by health insurers and that CHI made a formal settlement with its former chief executive officer.</p>

          <from> Mr. David Gunning<recordedTime time="2025-05-22T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_65">I thank the Cathaoirleach and Deputies for inviting the NPHDB to discuss our 2023 audited accounts. I am the development board's chief officer. I am accompanied by Phelim Devine, project director, and Emma Curtis, medical director of NPHDB and a paediatric consultant at Tallaght. The NPHDB was established by statutory instrument in 2007 with the purpose to design, build, equip and furnish the children's hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_66">In November 2021, the Government strengthened the governance structures for the project. This led to the appointment of the HSE lead director and the creation of a national oversight group, which is chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Health. The function of this group is to oversee, monitor and support the project’s progress regarding timeline, scope and budget, and provide an effective and consistent challenge to the programme implementation.</p>
          <p eId="para_67"> In February 2024, the Government approved an increase in the capital budget to €1.88 billion. The increase addressed long-standing budget requirements that were not included in the original 2018 budget, including construction inflation above 4%. Like other areas of the construction sector, the project costs have been affected by external pressures, including the impact on supply chains as a result of the pandemic and global events such as the war in Ukraine and Brexit.</p>
          <p eId="para_68"> In addition, the approved increase in the budget addressed areas identified in the 2019 PwC report. That report found that the children’s hospital was unique in scope, scale and complexity in comparison to any other health infrastructure project in Ireland's history. The authors were explicit in stating that the project's complexity should not be understated. The 2019 PwC report also noted a number of risks that had the potential to place further cost pressure on the approved capital budget. These included the contractor entitlements; an outturn of provisional sums, which were items for which there could be no cost certainty until their procurement closer to the end of the project; recovery of construction inflation above 4%; and the need for additional capacity and capability in the NPHDB executive team. All of the recommendations from that report have been implemented in full.</p>
          <p eId="para_69"> The NPHDB’s 2023 accounts have been audited and approved by the Comptroller and Auditor General. Expenditure for that year was €156 million, as Mr. McCarthy mentioned, including accruals and VAT. The audit for 2024 is continuing. There is a table in the slide with the key areas; I do not propose to go through it.</p>
          <p eId="para_70"> On claims management and legal proceedings, claims are a part of all major construction projects. When the contractor submits legitimate claims, they are paid. The NPHDB, acting on behalf of the State, vigorously defends any claims it believes to be without merit or inflated. The contractor - BAM - continues to submit a high volume of claims. However, based on the outcomes from the dispute resolution process, which includes adjudication, conciliation and determinations made by the employer’s representative, the net increase to the overall contract value to date is approximately €50.5 million, excluding inflation. This represents less than 6% of the original contract value of €910 million. The information pack provided in advance included an overview of the claims process, a summary table of the most recent claims and details of the five sets of current High Court proceedings.</p>
          <p eId="para_71"> Regarding a project update, the centres in Tallaght and Connolly hospitals, which opened in 2021 and 2019, respectively, were handed over to Children’s Health Ireland and are fully operational. We have provided the images and the documents where members have seen the final stages of the construction approaching at the new children's hospital. In addition, the Ronald McDonald House family accommodation unit at the main entrance to the children's hospital is being progressed by Clancy Construction. It is approximately 75% complete as of now, with a scheduled completion in quarter 3 of this year. Work is ongoing on fit-out, including 52 family rooms, communal kitchens and dining and support areas. Mechanical and electrical work is progressing well and power-on is scheduled very soon.</p>
          <p eId="para_72"> While the NCH is reaching the final construction phase, progress has not been made at the expected pace. Most internal and external areas have been brought to an initial stage of completion. As per the contract, these areas must undergo a four-stage inspection and sign-off process, and the stages are set out in the statement. Stages 1 and 2 are approximately 80% complete and stage 3 is expected to begin shortly. Technical commissioning, which concerns the hospital’s mechanical and electrical systems, is also under way and is approximately 70% complete. It will continue until the substantial completion.</p>
          <p eId="para_73"> As far as equipping is concerned, advanced specialist medical and non-medical equipment, including MRIs, scanners, X-ray machines, dental suites and so on, have been installed and final commissioning is currently in progress. The construction of the hospital’s helipad is complete. It now needs to be commissioned, and following test flights, we would sincerely look forward to the licensing being completed by the Irish Aviation Authority. The NPHDB has appointed ClearSphere to carry out four specialist fit-outs within the hospital. These are scheduled for completion very soon.</p>
          <p eId="para_74"> On the timeline, when we appeared before the Oireachtas Committee on Health in September 2024, BAM had committed to a completion date of June 2025. In the past seven months, BAM has achieved approximately 60% of its planned progress as set out in that programme. We hold BAM to account across several KPIs, and all of these are currently indicated as being behind schedule. On 6 May, BAM indicated to the employer’s representative that it had extended the programme's substantial completion date to 30 September. Accordingly, the employer’s representative has formally requested that BAM submit a detailed programme setting out its actions and reasons for delay.</p>
          <p eId="para_75"> This further delay is a cause of great frustration. While we acknowledge that progress is happening, the pace at which it is happening is insufficient to meet the 30 June deadline that BAM committed to. At a meeting in early October 2024 with the former Minister for Health, BAM committed to permit early access three months prior to substantial completion. Early access for CHI has not yet commenced, as the areas identified for early access have not yet been completed to the standard required by the contract. We have been engaging intensively with BAM and CHI to enable this early access as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_76"> The NPHDB continues to utilise all levers in the contract to compel BAM to conclude its work and fulfil its contractual responsibilities. The NPHDB is focused on ensuring that the quality of every room, clinical space, operating theatre, play area and so on meets the quality standard that is required by the contract. Any rooms or spaces that do not meet that required standard will be rejected.</p>
          <p eId="para_77"> In conclusion, I assure the committee that the NPHDB is working with our colleagues in CHI, the Department of Health and the HSE and with the contractor to bring this world-class hospital to completion as soon as possible. We understand and share the concern that it has not been completed. Once completed and operational, however, this hospital will be transformational.</p>

          <from> Ms Lucy Nugent<recordedTime time="2025-05-22T10:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_79">I thank the Chair, and good morning. I thank the committee for the opportunity to address it today about CHI’s financial statements for 2023 and to give members an update on service delivery across our children’s hospitals as well as an update on the commissioning programme for the new children’s hospital, which includes an extensive integration and transformation programme. I note the committee has also referenced other areas it would like to discuss and I hope our correspondence submitted was of use.</p>
          <p eId="para_80"> I am the recently appointed chief executive of CHI. I am joined by my colleagues: Mr. John Fitzpatrick, interim chief financial officer; Ms Julia Lewis, CHI’s transformation director, who is charged with leading CHI’s efforts to be ready and able to move into and open the new children’s hospital; and Dr. Ike Okafor, one of our three clinical directors who manage the 39 specialties across our services. I regret that CHI was not in a position to accept the invitation to attend the previous meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts but we welcome the opportunity to appear before members today. I will endeavour to answer all of their questions to the best of my ability.</p>
          <p eId="para_81"> I assumed the position of chief executive four months ago. Having started my career as a nurse in what was formerly Temple Street Children’s University Hospital, I am conscious of both the privilege and responsibility I have as CEO to ensure that we at CHI provide the highest quality care to the children who come to us when they are at their sickest.</p>
          <p eId="para_82"> Last year, CHI treated more than 148,000 children who attended our emergency departments. Almost 29,000 children underwent day case procedures, more than 17,000 children underwent theatre procedures and almost 29,000 children and young people had an inpatient stay with us. Specialised care was delivered to these children despite being in old and not-for-purpose buildings. We continue to lead on paediatric research and innovation on an international stage because we strongly believe our children and young people deserve the best that medicine and science can offer.</p>
          <p eId="para_83"> I am very proud to lead our almost 5,000 staff, who work at the front line of paediatric care provision across our four sites in CHI at Temple Street, Crumlin and Tallaght, and at our urgent care centre at Connolly Hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_84">We are a place of excellence in paediatric healthcare and we have dedicated and diligent staff – a message that is sometimes lost and especially in the current climate. We want every child, patient and family who meet us to feel safe and cared for. Acknowledging when things go wrong in healthcare is essential for building trust, learning and ultimately improving patient safety and outcomes. We are committed to transparency and openness with the children, young people and families we care for. In that regard, I acknowledge the children and families who were impacted by the events highlighted in the recent HIQA report. What happened should not have happened and children should have been protected from harm. We are deeply and unreservedly sorry to those families. CHI fully accepts the recommendations of the HIQA report and we will publish updates to our resulting quality improvement plan on our website to ensure transparency and openness around improvements to services.</p>
          <p eId="para_85"> I also acknowledge those families impacted by other issues related to the orthopaedic service, specifically where reports are awaited. I know families are anxiously awaiting the publication of these reports. The committee will appreciate that the most important people with regard to this audit are the families involved and they will be communicated with in the first instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_86"> Since being appointed to my role, I have prioritised the delivery of safe and excellent care, fostering an open and supportive culture for children, families and staff and strengthening all aspects of our governance. The events I referenced have broken trust with our families, staff and stakeholders. I am committed to rebuilding that trust and leading a wonderful team of people across CHI.</p>
          <p eId="para_87"> The financial statements before the committee have been audited by the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General for the year ended 2023. The committee will note CHI returned a deficit of €7.8 million for 2023. This compared with a deficit of €0.9 million in 2022. The increase reflects the net impact of the incremental cost of provision of services as offset by increased funding received from the HSE by CHI. The cumulative deficit at 31 December 2023 amounted to €18 million. This includes the €7.8 million deficit for 2023, just referred to, and a substantial element of the balance relates to legacy deficits incurred prior to the establishment of CHI.</p>
          <p eId="para_88"> In relation to governance and risk management, we have a detailed governance statement provided as per the requirements of the code of practice for State bodies. We also draw the committee's attention to the statement on internal control in which CHI confirms it has undertaken an annual review of internal control and makes specific disclosures regarding procurement non-compliance and rejected insurance claims.</p>
          <p eId="para_89"> As the client for the new children’s hospital, I welcome the opportunity to provide this committee with an update from CHI’s perspective about this wonderful and exciting project. Together with the NPHDB, we are focused on doing all that we can to ensure the hospital opens as soon as possible and is operational to international standards. In line with Sláintecare principles, the national model of care for paediatric healthcare services will ensure a child is treated as close to home as possible. This will put the new hospital at the epicentre of a network of care, in collaborative partnership with our colleagues in regional centres, to deliver comprehensive paediatric care for Ireland’s children and young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_90"> The new hospital will also support an all island of Ireland approach to the delivery of paediatric care, building on the success of the all-island congenital heart disease network, and will stand with our two satellite centres at Tallaght and Connolly hospitals, ensuring children receive the right care, in the right place, at the right time. However, a building does not provide care - people do - and we must ensure our staff are fully prepared and supported through this process. Delivery of this project of exceptional transformation, digitalisation, integration and change is the largest in the history of the Irish healthcare system. I am committed to ensuring that CHI delivers a return on this investment by the State with our vision of healthier children and young people throughout Ireland underpinned by living our values to be “child-centred, compassionate, progressive and we will act with respect, excellence and integrity”.</p>
          <p eId="para_91"> All of this activity will take place while 36,000 pieces of equipment are placed, installed and commissioned in 6,000 rooms and spaces while we continue to deliver essential services for children and young people on existing sites. It is a complex operation requiring meticulous planning, which is well advanced.</p>
          <p eId="para_92"> In finishing, our primary focus in CHI is, at all times, to deliver timely access to quality, safe care to children and young people. The journey to the new hospital is a once-in-a-generation change, and we are working hard to make sure everything is safe, ready, and right for patients, families, and staff so that we can maximise the impact that this wonderful new hospital will have on those we care for.</p>

          <p eId="para_93">I thank Ms Nugent for her opening statement. Before I move to members, whose time I know is precious, I want to try to establish some facts for the record which may help their work in the limited time they have to extract specific data. To hear the further delays and that BAM has only achieved 60% of its targets over the last seven months is bitterly disappointing. How many times has the substantial completion date shifted? I have lost count as to whether it is 12, 13, 14 or 15 times. For the record, how many times has the date shifted now?</p>

          <p eId="para_128">As outlined in the opening statement, there is a considerable amount of medical equipment that was already in the hospital. All the diagnostic equipment and all the other items are already in there, as listed. Then there is a phase between. The early access that is referred to in the opening statement allows both NPHDB and CHI to get access in advance of substantial completion. The purpose of early access is to allow us to, shall we say, de-risk or move forward with some of the aspects of hospital fit-out in advance of substantial completion.</p>

          <p eId="para_129">That is what I was going to say. I was going to link it in with the tied question I had on the phased early access. Would that essentially be before the building is complete? Before you get the keys, we will say. Mr. Gunning would expect to get the keys in September under the current timeline, notwithstanding what has to be gone through ahead of that? There would be early access before then.</p>

          <p eId="para_130">I will ask Mr. Devine to deal with the detail on that but I can give the Deputy one sentence which is that early access is in advance of substantial completion. As I am sure the Deputy is well aware, once a contractor takes over a site like that, it is theirs. Therefore, allowing us or anybody else onto it is what they call privileged or early access, which is what we have negotiated with BAM. There was an element of early access in the contract that was signed back in August 2017. We are now looking at a slightly larger - 30% of the floor area - early access, which will allow a meaningful opportunity for CHI to get into those particular areas.</p>

          <p eId="para_133">Yes, there will. On early access, what we have scoped out with BAM is about 30% of the building that we get about three months prior to substantial completion. That gives us the ability to install and commission circa 25,000 pieces of the equipment in the building at a maximum. They will be put in place working with our vendors and then commissioned in place and connected. That helps de-risk then the operational commission period that follows.</p>

          <p eId="para_137">In that early access phase, we would load the equipment and integrate it with the electronic healthcare record to test it. We would also get a complete ward. Again, you get to test the logistics of doing that commissioning element. That is the plan in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_138">I think in the note we received yesterday €853 million was the figure given for claims, and €793 million was listed for the end of 2023. It is obviously increased by €60 million, but it is roughly static because it was €700 million in the 2022 accounts. That number has sat there. It obviously relates to BAM. It is a number the witnesses do not believe has credibility judging by the fact that they have not accrued in the accounts on any of basis of that €800 million.</p>

          <p eId="para_139">Correct. The public work contract is the contract we are using on this project. It is the contract approved by the Department of public expenditure and it is what is used on the vast majority of public works in Ireland. It has stages in it in terms of disputes and claims and how these are managed. If the contractor feels there is a delay event or a compensation event, they fill out a claim under clause 10.3 of the contract and that claim has to be processed. There are a number of stages where the claim can be either validated and agreed to or moved on to another stage. I am not going to go through it now. From that initial stage, it is presented to the employer's representative, who is the impartial independent reviewer of these things. So far, she has identified that BAM is entitled to 6% of what it is claiming as its entitlements.</p>

          <p eId="para_148">At the same time, however, it has been felt, more so than the rest of the claims, that there is a reason.

Why is that sitting separate from the €800 million and recognised in two completely different parts of the financial statements?</p>

          <p eId="para_149">Back to the four-stage process, stage 1 is the employer's representative determination. Then it goes to what is called a project board that may or may not agree what has happened. Then it goes to conciliation. In the case of the €107.6 million, the standing conciliator, who is another engineer appointed for the entirety of the project, has reviewed BAM's claim and he has made a recommendation that this claim should be paid to the value of €107 million. In relation to that, the development board has issued, again under the contract, a notice of dissatisfaction that has the effect of negating, if you like, the recommendation. However, under the contract, if the contractor does two things, we are required to make the payment, but it is a bonded payment. The contractor has to initiate court proceedings which it has done in this case regarding this critical delay conciliation and it must also raise a bond. There is a bond with Zurich, the large financial institution, regarding that €107 million that we hold.</p>

          <p eId="para_158">The initial cost of the project was €800 million. That rose to €1.2 billion, the €1.74 billion and now stands at €2.24 billion. What is the key driver of that increase on the NPHDB's side? The contractor indicated that it relates to design change. Does Mr. Gunning agree?</p>

          <p eId="para_159">I agree that that is what the contractor maintains. I absolutely refute and rebut that. Just to be clear on the numbers, the contract value is €910 million. We have agreed that, as I have indicated, there is an additional €50.5 million that currently is crystalised in relation to that, so that can be added. That is the current liability on the project. Regarding the escalation, the vast amount of any increase is due to extension of time and the fact that the timeline has gone on. When the contract was signed to complete the project or, more specifically, when the phase B instruction was issued instructing the contractor to proceed with phase B in January of 2019, the project was to take 46 months to complete. It should have completed in August 2022. That was the time. We are now a considerable number of months beyond that and that has to be paid for. In the development board's case, we have to pay for our design team and the development board which is in the order of €2 million per month. This continues to increase the costs relating to the project.</p>

          <p eId="para_162">At one end, we have the right to terminate on a basis of certain situations arising. That is the extreme end. At the other end, we can reduce BAM's payments by 15% in the event it does not provide us with a programme. We have done that numerous times throughout the course of the project. When BAM then submits a programme, all of that money gets repaid. The only other option is the application of liquidated damages. That is extreme.</p>

          <p eId="para_166">No, we do not believe that. We have said to the contractor and in this forum on multiple occasions that we think there are insufficient resources and supervision on the site. If the contractor is only making 60% of its planned programme, obviously there are not enough resources. There should be enough resources there to make 100% of its committed programme and it has not done that. In the 18 months the contractors have been on the project, I would say they have hit their committed or planned progress fewer than ten times. There have never been sufficient resources on the programme, in our opinion. </p>

Regarding the children's hospital, the public is completely outraged at what seems to be a ballooning budget all the time with no end in sight. I am trying to get a handle on the scale of the mismanagement. The National Paediatric Hospital Development Board was established in 2007 and in 2009, the then Taoiseach, Brian Cowen, announced that the children's hospital would open in late 2014. In 2015, a report was commissioned by the board and indicated at that stage that the hospital would cost €650 million. Is that all correct?</p>

To pick out one example, I do not think people anticipated at the time that there would ever be Brexit, a war in Ukraine or the level of construction inflation we have experienced. The contractor agreed to pay for the first 4% of any inflation and to absorb that cost and the figure above 4% was the State's cost. The construction inflation we have had to pay to the contractor over and above what was agreed has cost the State roughly €50 million over the period until the middle of 2022.

          <p eId="para_214">I want to keep that in mind as I go on to my next point. In 2017, the then Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, gave a commitment that no child would wait for the treatment of scoliosis for longer than four months by the end of the year. How many children are currently waiting for longer than four months? At what point will that commitment be met?</p>

          <p eId="para_215">I understand that as of last week, 56 children had been waiting for four months. That is 56 children too many. I appreciate that. Much work and focus has been on reducing our spinal waiting times. Our waiting times for our outpatients are down by 40%. As for our waiting list, while we have had an increase in additions of 12.5% overall, it is down 8%. The activity itself has increased. There are children behind every single percentage.</p>

Those non-medical grade springs were placed in the bodies of children with scoliosis who were under CHI's care. One line that stood out to me in the HIQA report was that children were not protected from the risk of harm. Does Ms Nugent accept this has been the case?</p>

One of the early recommendations from the audit was that children should be followed up to skeletal maturity, which is when their bones fuse. The auditor found that this was not a consistent practice. It is a newer international practice guideline so we felt it appropriate not to wait until we got the final report but to advise the parents of that, and that we would be following up with them.

          <p eId="para_264">Just as Ms Nugent has outlined, in general, CEOs, including hospital group CEOs, are appointed for one five-year fixed-term contract. In exceptional circumstances, a case can be made to the parent Department for the reappointment for a second, final, fixed-term contract, up to a maximum of ten years. The previous Minister was very cognisant of the guidelines for the appointment of CEOs to non-commercial State bodies and so did not consent to the appointment of the CEO for a third time.</p>

The invoices were raised in a timely fashion. However, we are reliant on a fully collated submission to go into the private health insurers. There was a delay in some of the third parties providing that information. That is across the continuum of care of the patients' episodes, so it would include laboratories, diagnostics and additional consultations. That arose. I am pleased to say that, in 2024, we were able to recoup €400,000 of rejected claims. It is an area of focus for my colleague in the finance department.</p>

At the end of 2023, €208 million of that was unspent, against 2024, when €156 million of that was unspent. We continuously have to review those workstreams and the profile of them. If you asked me a week ago was there sufficient funding to see the project through to completion, I would have said "Yes." If there are new dates now, we have to review, revalidate and extend out the programmes again. We have curtailed some of those workstreams to pause them, as delays have arisen, to ensure then that the costs are incurred and can be deferred out further.</p>

On the claims that have gone on to the second, third and fourth phases of the disputes process, all remain unresolved. That is 2,200 or so individual claims. I will give one sentence on the claims. It will give a sense of the question I am sure committee members will have - "Where is the money?" At the small end, there are 1,637 claims that are all for under €10,000 each, which amount to €2.1 million. That is 1,600 claims. At the other end, there are 16 claims that account for approximately €800 million.

We do not break that out but that was €1.8 million. You will see that on page 23 of the 2023 accounts.</p>
          <p eId="para_380"> Legal expenses are ongoing day to day. On procurement advice and running procurement programmes, we have just finished, for example, a procurement process for the car park in the hospital. These are ongoing day-to-day business that require some degree of support.</p>

          <p eId="para_381">I am caught for time but might get a chance to come in again later. I will go briefly to Children's Health Ireland to finish on a different note. When this hospital is operational next year, will CHI give us a sense of what it will do for children's health? Will there be a seismic change in treatments and waiting lists? We need to get some sense of where we are with this. Obviously, the project is bogged down in a quagmire of rising costs, legal costs, disputes and so on. Where are we as regards children's health, which ultimately is the important issue?</p>

          <p eId="para_382">It is a great question. We are bringing together the 39 specialties. These are currently disparate across multiple sites. That gives us an opportunity to have the best of the best in one location for the children of Ireland. We want to work with our regional partners to ensure a child in Donegal, Cork or Kerry gets the same level of care as if they were in a quaternary centre, such as ourselves. It will enable us to leverage that expertise but it will not be the same way of working that it is today. For example, we will be a fully digital hospital at HIMSS level 6. This means that we can leverage data and information. We can forecast and trend, not only from an activity point of view but also from a children's health point of view. We will initially open an additional three operating theatres. That will mean we will be able to provide in excess of an additional 3,000 operating procedures, which is fantastic. We have increased opening capacity, again, enabling us to expand our services.</p>
          <p eId="para_383"> It will impact on waiting lists and patient outcomes. We are a research and innovation focus. We feel very strongly that our children should have access to the best available treatment, which is really important. We are doing that on an all-Ireland basis. From that perspective, we will have a quaternary neonatal ICU, the first of its kind in the country. Newborn babies are being resuscitated earlier and earlier. It will be amazing to provide that service to the entire country. There will be 18 beds in that new facility. We are very excited about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_384"> In addition, there will be a new CAMHS unit. While it is not under the governance of CHI, it is fantastic that we will be able to work alongside our mental health colleagues to try to address some of the challenges young people are experiencing from a mental health point of view. That is another opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_385"> While Ronald McDonald House is not under CHI but operating under licence to it, 52 families will be able to be reunited with their child there. There is nothing worse than fragmenting a family, particularly for a child who has to spend long periods in hospital. There will be an underground tunnel, which means families will not have go outside in the middle of the night, if their child needs them. There will be 14 gardens over 4 acres. Children will be able to play outside in a safe environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">Having a raised helipad will mean we will be able to transport children from all around the country quickly. It will also serve our colleagues in St. James's Hospital. There are lots of things. I am quite passionate and I could keep talking about it.</p>

          <p eId="para_413">The Deputy has asked many questions, for which I thank her. I will try to unpick some of it. If I were to describe the overall relationship with the contractor – I have been in this role since September 2019, or for five and a half years – I would say we have gone through various undulations or ups and downs. We have always tried to remain absolutely focused on the objective, which is to get the hospital done, and we have always tried to be extremely professional. I would say that is the case on the BAM side and in relation to ourselves. We acknowledge there are 600 or so people from BAM or its subcontractors on site every day. We are making progress, but it is not at the stage we would like.</p>
          <p eId="para_414"> The money to be paid to BAM is all governed by the contract that was entered into in August 2017. The contract sum is €910 million, and there will be some variations on top of that, with a variation of €50 million determined by the employer’s representative and the €50 million in inflation that went on top of that. That is exactly where things stand at the moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_415"> On our intention regarding all the claims, I can take the Deputy through the claims table, which we provided in advance. It shows the number of claims provided. Some have been withdrawn. The ER has determined the vast majority of those claims at this time. It has been determined by an independent authority that the €800 million is equivalent to €50 million. The next phase of the disputes process is conciliation. Each of the processes involves very significant, almost quasi-legal, engagement. We have legal representation at each, generally counsel-----</p>

          <p eId="para_417">I can comment on that from the development board’s point of view. As the Deputy can well imagine, we have ongoing relationships with the Department of Health and the HSE. I have been involved in many conversations on the takeaways from this and how they might be applied to the new maternity hospital, for example, and various other things. The Department of Health – the representatives here might want to comment on this – has co-ordinated a kind of arrangement whereby the learning could be transferred. However, independently, we have had discussions with the senior people in the HSE on capital projects.</p>

Everyone has a personalised journey moving to the new hospital because, obviously, teams are merging. We have commenced the process and it will be completed shortly. In addition, we have a form with our trade unions whereby any issues that arise can be raised.

          <p eId="para_425">There are the usual things, such as car parking and the location of offices. More important, because we are doing clinical integration, staff are asking which team they will be on. I referred to neonatal care earlier.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">At the moment, there are some high-dependency beds in a neonatal ward.

          <p eId="para_428">The top three themes are parking, start times - because people could be on different rosters so it is a case of whose roster - and how we do our business. We started off with 6,000 policies and procedures across our three entities. We have now merged and reduced them to 1,025, which is still a significant number. They are done against joint commission international standards so it is not the Tallaght, Temple Street or Crumlin way. Again, this has brought staff on a journey with us. There has been fantastic engagement. In the first quarter of this year, there were 185 meetings with our clinical staff, which is phenomenal. That is on top of their day jobs so we are asking a lot of them and I do recognise that.</p>

          <p eId="para_449"> The report from 2019 referred to by Mr. Gunning set out the cost overruns, which were of such significance and size that the report was commissioned. It acknowledged how complex the project was but it also said that the baseline had not been established, basic things had not been done and, therefore, it needed to be changed. Here we are now in 2025 and we are asking the same questions all over again. When I hear the word "transformational" used about a hospital, I think it is fantastic but we need a transformation in the processes so that we do not need to bring Mr. Gunning or the board in here nine times and we do not need to ask the same questions over and over again and we still have no hospital. </p>

Perhaps I might suggest what we have discussed with the HSE, for example, because when we disappear, all the intellectual property and warranties have to be transferred to someone and, under the Act, they are transferred to the Health Service Executive. The realistic thing is that the end of the warranty defects period is 18 months after substantial completion. It should be some time after that. The Minister will obviously decide, but we will already be winding down the development board. Staffing will already be winding down once we hit substantial completion.</p>

When there were issues that had to be fixed post substantial completion, it took quite a bit of time to get the contractor to get those closed out. I think it will take those 18 months, and after that would be the appropriate time for the Minister to consider that particular wind-down.</p>

I understand inflation and the different reasons, but the board was set up and then there is an oversight body after that under the Department, which I have not even got to. Maybe at some stage we might get information on that, because, from day one, it was not staying within costs. Still, the costs have gone up. We have a board doing its best, and I am not here to castigate or cast aspersions, but there is no learning from this unless we have a complete breakdown of the figures, and on a rough estimate it seems to be 60:40.</p>

          <p eId="para_531">To get to the completion of the project, there are a number of KPIs we look at, but there are two main KPIs, one of which is bringing the hospital up to the completion standard. We talked about 5,740 room spaces in the hospital. They have to be brought up. The opening statement talked about the four-stage process. We are now going into stage 3, which is when, after they have been offered to the design team, the design team inspects them. There are approximately ten snags per room and the contractor has to de-snag those and offer them as snag free. That process is about to complete. We have 5,740 rooms to be offered back to us officially from the contractor for sign-off. The second KPI is the technical commissioning of the hospital. That includes all of the mechanical, electrical and building systems like lifts, opening vents, fire alarm systems and all that. That system commissioning is approximately 70% through, as we talked about earlier. Following that, those systems have to be integrated together and then the functionality of the hospital has to be demonstrated in a fire alarm situation. Things have to turn off and turn on. They are the two main drivers of getting to the end date. They are the ones, in terms of KPIs, that are tracking behind the programme.</p>

We have a number of overseas board members who travel to Dublin on a monthly basis. I can only assume the figure relates to the cost of flights and accommodation for the number of UK-based board members who attend in person.

          <p eId="para_612">We are apologising for any distress the letters may cause. The reason we wrote to those families, as I explained earlier, was that there was an early recommendation that any child who had any type of hip surgery for dysplasia - all children - should be consistently followed up to skeletal maturity. Rather than waiting for the final report to be issued, we wanted to advise families that they would be contacted by us, and some of them have been already, to start that process of skeletal follow-up to maturity. We understand that in trying to communicate openly, there was a balance between being open and transparent and the possibility of causing concern because we did not yet have all the answers. We felt it was better to err on the side of saying we will be calling people for skeletal maturity follow-up. That is an international best practice recommendation - I think the Deputy is wondering about this - irrespective of whether the surgery was necessary.</p>

          <p eId="para_633">Thank you. There was a slight disparity between what Ms Nugent was saying about how the CEO was not reappointed and what Ms Conroy was saying on behalf of the Department of Health. Ms Conroy was very firm and clear that the Minister did not consent to that appointment. The clear implication and inference of the decision of the Minister not to consent to the reappointment is that it related to all the issues we are discussing with regard to orthopaedic surgeries, notwithstanding what is contained in the HIQA report relating to the CEO. Is that Ms Nugent’s understanding too? </p>

There is a report in <i>The Irish Times </i>that next year it will be €200,000. That is correct, yes? Does CHI think it will get to a point where what is essentially free money will end at zero? By free money I mean that this is money owing to CHI. The consultants just have to submit the forms and the money comes back to the hospital. Think of all the parents who have benefitted from the extraordinary services that CHI provides to children; they go out and fundraise, they might raise a cheque for €5,000, they support the hospital and they see this €250,000 or €200,000 not being claimed when it is owed to it. One can understand the upset and frustration arising from it. Can CHI say that in 2025 or next year it could get to a place where it is close to zero in that regard?</p>

          <p eId="para_666">They are all pretty much aligned in leaning towards the September date. However, we have our analysis, which Phelim Devine has given us. The programme is there. We have five key performance indicators that we monitor. All of those key performance indicators are currently behind the target that BAM has given itself in its own programme, so we are behind schedule on these points.</p>

          <p eId="para_678">I will go back to give a bit of context. When BAM made that commitment to the Minister in October to deliver the hospital for June 2025, there were approximately 750 productive resources on the site. Following that commitment, there was a bump to approximately 900, which was great. That number endured until around Christmas. Since January this year, however, it has been slowly dropping off every month. We are now down to fewer than 600 productive resources. Despite this, regarding the programme, they are not meeting their commitments.</p>

Before we accept that bond, we are given a chance to review and approve it, and there is a whole process around this. Regarding the State's liability in that regard, when the State hands over €107 million, we are absolutely confident in those circumstances that if something were to happen, we can go to the bondsman and get that money back.</p>

While I appreciate she spoke about transparency and openness in her opening statement and I appreciate the approach she has taken, maybe I am wrong but when we speak about training and preparation for meetings like this and then use those words in the same line as openness and transparency, it is a bit unfortunate. We are trying to come at this from an open and transparent point of view. I hope the purpose of that training was not to go against that. She spoke about the Government practice to appoint chief executives to State bodies on five-year contracts. We have heard about that this morning.

There seems to be some ambiguity between what is in the C and AG’s report versus what has been said here today, that if the CHI instigated a mediation process, incurred legal costs associated with that process, and the person was still employed in the role. I would appreciate clarity if there were legal fees incurred by the CHI in that process.</p>

          <p eId="para_726">The witnesses are all welcome. I appreciate them coming before the committee today. At the outset, I want to frame this conversation. It is vital to say we have a job to do and the witnesses have a job to do, but what we are talking about here today is children’s health, taxpayers’ money and the dedicated staff working day in and day out in our hospitals. I say that to be mindful of the fact that when I am asking these questions, I am asking them because I want to see the very best outcome for the children of Ireland. I must also say that this is a serious matter.</p>

There are 16 claims that amount to approximately €800 million and each of them is for a component of the delay that BAM claims the employer - the State side - has delayed its progress from August 2022 up until now.

          <p eId="para_748">I have briefly summarised the three levers in the contract, all of which we have used. Termination is one; can we terminate the contract? When BAM failed to return to site for another seven or eight weeks after the Government-mandated Covid shutdown, the board had no option but to commence termination proceedings. BAM, in return, came back to site and those proceedings were brought to a conclusion. We also have the application of liquidated damages to effectively compensate the development board for the costs we are incurring. If we just run the liquidated damages summary from when the project should have finished in November 2022 up to the end of August, the amount the State could apply is approximately €31.5 million. That is all subject to disputes already and possible court resolution of those issues. They are the main levers we have. That is the primary motivator. That is the-----</p>

          <p eId="para_759">I just want to link this in. One of the issues the Comptroller and Auditor General found in his audit was that there was material non-compliance in public procurement. Does that material non-compliance in public procurement and the instances he found speak to the wider issue in CHI with the non-CE-marked items getting approved? The reason I ask is that there obviously had to be a supplier for these. That supplier had to be approved and had to be on the books of and dealing with CHI. Who approved or raised the purchase order for this non-CE-marked, not approved equipment?</p>

          <p eId="para_760">One of the challenges we previously had was that we did not have centralised procurement. In Temple Street particularly, where this incident happened, there were several different departments that could directly order things. In that situation, the items were ordered through the clinical engineering department, although as well articulated in the HIQA report, the individual was unaware of what they were being procured for. The individual thought they were part of an external traction system. What we have done since January 2023 is to have centralised procurement across all of CHI.</p>

          <p eId="para_762">I thank Ms Nugent; that is okay. That is an important point because we know there is material non-compliance within it and then we have issues like this that arise. There is a disconnect between the controls and the reality that the patients are experiencing. I hope CHI endeavours to rebuild trust within the organisation because I have serious concerns around the culture. People place their trust when they bring their children to these hospitals. That is just something to be aware of.</p>
          <p eId="para_763"> I am conscious that I only have a minute remaining. I want to move on to the CEO - not Ms Nugent; the former CEO - and I want to get this completely clear. It was reported in <i>The Journal</i> and <i>The Irish Times </i>that the CEO salary for CHI was in excess of €180,000. This person finished a fixed-term contract as CEO, entered into a legal battle with CHI, a settlement was agreed and now the individual is a strategic director still earning in excess of €180,000.

Yes, this is a setback because we expected to move in on the Easter weekend of 2026 but we will use this opportunity to further enhance our preparations. Take our new electronic healthcare record, for example. One usually starts with the basic package and then adds on the models. We are already testing and using those models.</p>

          <p eId="para_894">I was asked to put the following information on the record because people hear about hip dysplasia and what it means is important. We are talking about children and their families. If the witnesses do not mind, I want to read this. It was given to me by Senator Maria McCormack, one of my colleagues, and involves a person in the constituency in which the Senator lives. The people involved said they do not mind being named but I am not going to name them. It involves a boy who is now 11 years old. He was originally referred to Temple Street Hospital where a doctor, who I will not name, advised that his left hip required replacement but that the right hip was fine. The left hip was subsequently operated on. However, in 2018, they were called back and told that the right hip also needed replacing despite this young boy having no issues with that hip.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">Trusting the medical advice, the family agreed to the second surgery. That turned out to be a devastating decision, in the family's own words. From the moment of the second operation, the little boy's quality of life deteriorated dramatically. He went from being fully toilet trained to fully incontinent. He lost feeling in his hip area and is now unable to tell when he has soiled himself. At just 11 years old, he now wears nappies daily and has to be changed up to five times a day. The little boy has been left with permanent bowel issues, going from 14 to 20 days without any bowel movements. The only response from the hospital has been to increase laxatives, which have brought no real relief or improvement.</p>
          <p eId="para_896"> The family are absolutely heartbroken. Not only did the surgery change their son's life in the worst possible way, but they are now faced with the reality that it may have been unnecessary in the first place. They say the psychological and emotional toll of that realisation is immeasurable. It is important to put that on the record as to what this actually means. Correct me if I am wrong on the figure, but did Ms Nugent say that 1,757 letters had sent out?</p>

At that stage, on the basis of a late 2024 assumption on completion we added another six months in terms of the budgeting to give us some leeway.

The opening date that Ms Nugent has given us of June of next year is predicated on the handover of the hospital in September from the contractor. If we do not have a lot of confidence in the contractor, that surely opens up a big question in terms of the opening schedule for the hospital. </p>

To be very correct, what I hope I said was that I certainly do not have confidence in the contractor and the 15 different dates is evidence as to why the development board should not have that confidence, but I cannot express or provide assurance to the committee today in respect of the September deliverable until such a time as we interrogate the contractor's programme in detail. We may interrogate that and find it is a realistic programme and the contractor is going to deliver it if it resources. I just cannot give that assurance today. </p>

          <p eId="para_1018">We are talking about a phased opening insofar as, for example, the hospital has been built for generations to come. For example, we have 22 theatres. We currently have 15, we are opening 18 and we will open the remaining four over the subsequent years. That makes sense from a workforce, but also from a demand, perspective. </p>

          <p eId="para_1022">I might come in on that. We have procured 80% to 90% of the equipment. Approximately €30 million or €40 million of it is embedded in the contract or we bought it and it has gone into the building. For instance, the CTs and MRIs are all in. Automatic guided, AG, vehicles are all in and they are being commissioned. On the group 3 and 4 items, which plug into data points or power, we have only €10 million of procurement to go and it is all in procurement.

          <p eId="para_1051"> The other element is we just need to make sure our staff are fully trained. This is a huge change-management project. We have an Eolas programme - it is our training programme with staff. We cannot do it until four months before the actual opening date because if you are shown a system, you will forget about it if you do not use it until a year later. The Eolas programme looks at the training needs of staff and also familiarisation with the building. We have a challenge to do all that for staff while also running business as usual.

          <p eId="para_1080">We are in an existing contractual relationship. We cannot change that because we are governed by the construct of the public works contract, but what we have done is taken learnings across a number of headings and we are now applying them to our next projects and programmes. Earlier there was a discussion by one of the Deputies regarding what we have learned as we face into the next capital build and how we will apply it. Equally, we have taken those lessons and engaged with the OGP and the Department of public expenditure and reform. I will provide a note on it. We supplied a note to the Joint Committee on Health. I think it was on 6 February of this year. I am happy to provide that to show the learnings we are applying and building into new programmes.</p>

          <p eId="para_1092">Going back to the former CEO, I have no difficulty with Ms Nugent having training before coming to the Committee of Public Accounts, given it is Ms Nugent's first time appearing before it. Her answers on the former CEO, however, were clearly a trained response. Ms Nugent does not own this situation that she has found herself in, but it was a clear case of a certain line being given out. For the public watching in and understanding this story, something is missing or awry here. The Minister refused to give the consent on the board's recommendation for this person's appointment as CEO, an unusual step, which Ms Nugent has acknowledged, as someone who has worked in hospitals for a long time. That person, who did not get appointed, had to hire a lawyer to advise her on her position with regard to whatever processes were going on. Presumably, Children's Health Ireland had to pay a lawyer as part of the mediation process. The outworking of that mediation process was that this person received a new position that did not previously exist at precisely the same salary Ms Nugent is currently on, and CHI had to pay its own lawyers and the other person's lawyers. Is that correct?</p>

          <p eId="para_1094">Ms Nugent can see that, for the public listening in and watching on, this is a most unsatisfactory outcome from a process whereby a Minister has taken a decision and we do not know the full reasons for that decision. We know the context and what is taking place surrounding that decision not to provide the consent, but we have absolutely no clarity regarding it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1095"> For Ms Nugent, as CEO of the hospital, it cannot be a satisfactory situation for her that a former CEO is lurking around the corridors as she is trying to build a new vision for the hospital and trying to move forward with the action plan. Does she agree that, all things being equal, if she could have some control over this, she would not have wished to have a former CEO sitting in the hospital working away, with her as the new CEO trying to deal with the issues that are before her?</p>

The board is made up of two construction lawyers and a senior counsel, all with very strong experience and the senior counsel being a former Government Minister. We have a former Secretary General of the Department of Finance. We have a number of engineers from large construction companies with great experience in large projects, including healthcare projects, who are household names in Ireland in terms of where they worked during their working life. We also have three former NHS commissioners of services - two from Northern Ireland and one from Scotland.</p>

The board, however, is focused on one thing: get this hospital open as soon as possible. That is our focus. That is not to say that we do not look at how we can learn. Mr. Tierney mentioned various processes earlier.

Forgive me, I cannot give the Cathaoirleach a monthly rate. I am looking for my notes here but I cannot find that slide. We have provided this to a number of public accounts committees in the past.

          <p eId="para_1130">It has been well documented and aired in the public domain. There are some posts that take a longer lead-in time than other posts will, for example, specialist nurses and consultant posts, but, again, we have a good track record of doing both on the island of Ireland and international recruitment. Anecdotally, we have been told that there are a lot of nurses in Australia who are only dying to come home when this hospital is opened.</p>

          <p eId="para_1136">Yes, I am. There are national shortages in sectors like medical scientists and radiology that every entity has. Relating to it being an attractive place to come to work, it is a state of art building with a great future, so I am confident. </p>

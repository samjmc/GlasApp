          <p eId="para_10">The purpose of this meeting is to consider Committee Stage of the Health Information Bill 2024. The aim behind the Bill is to improve the use of health information, ensure that the right information is available in the right place and at the right time and ensure the best care of and treatment for patients. The Bill provides for a duty to share held information for patients' care and treatment, the establishment of digital health records for all patients in Ireland, greater access for patients to their health information, greater protections around health information for primary use and better health information for the HSE for patient-interest purposes. It also underpins Ireland's EU obligations. I welcome the Minister for Health, Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill, who is accompanied by officials from her Department this morning.</p>
          <p eId="para_11"> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that may be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if members' statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with any such direction. </p>
          <p eId="para_12"> A total of 74 amendments have been tabled, and the grouping list has been provided to members. We will consider each amendment in turn.</p>

          <p eId="para_13">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_14">In page 6, line 16, to delete “Digital Health Record” and substitute “Electronic Health Record”.</p>
          <p eId="para_15"> There are quite a number of amendments in this group. They are: amendments Nos. 1, 6 to 10, inclusive, 12, 14 to 17, inclusive, 19, 21 to 26, inclusive, 28, 29, 32 to 39, inclusive, 43, 45 to 49, inclusive, 52 to 54, inclusive, 68, 69 and 71 to 74, inclusive. They are deal with the same thing, namely the deletion of the term "Digital Health Record" and its replacement with the term "Electronic Health Record". The purpose of this is to ensure that the terminology in the Bill is aligned with the language used in the European Health Data Space, EHDS, regulation, which came into force in each member state at the end of March. The aim behind the regulation is to establish a common framework for the use and exchange of electronic health data across the EU. The regulation will empower each of us to access, control and share electronic health information, both within Ireland and across borders, in the context of direct care.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> The purpose of the amendments is simply to make that naming change across the various provisions of the Bill. I can continue if Deputies wish but that is the purpose of this series of amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_19">It is to simply align the terminology in the Bill with the language used in the EHDS regulation. We are trying to establish a European-wide ability to share data in a consistent way. This simple terminological change will enable us to do that and to avoid purposely create legislation that is linguistically at odds with the rest of Europe.</p>

          <p eId="para_20">The last time we had a debate on this issue, it was in respect of the heads of Bill. Some of the same officials are involved again today. We had very lengthy discussions on the lack of progress in this area. Two years have passed. The question is, what progress has been made since? There was a lengthy discussion at that time on the different types of records involved. I refer to summary records, shared care records and then electronic health records. My understanding is that we are still at the point of working towards summary care records. Is that the case, and how far have we progressed in that regard?</p>

          <p eId="para_22">Since we met last, we have mobilised what it known locally as a national shared care record programme, which is about developing shared care records across care settings. For example, if a person was to seek assistance in an accident and emergency department, a shared care record would provide the staff involved with access to GP records and, where they exist, pharmacy and hospital records. This would mean that for at least the person's first intervention, those providing care could see a minimal level of information to help with diagnosis or intervention. The next phase-----</p>

          <p eId="para_24">Yes. They are one and the same, really. In practical terms, they are one and the same thing. That shared care record programme is now mobilised. We have appointed a vendor. Work is under way. By the end of this year, our ambition is to deploy that. Our first deployment in the Deputy's area in Waterford and the surrounding community will involve launching a shared care record pilot phase deployment. This will then be widened on a national basis in 2026 and 2027. We have made great progress.</p>

          <p eId="para_25">I want to tease out a few issues, and other members will want to come in as well. Obviously, that is good if we want to get to that space, but we are still a couple of years away from getting to the shared care record space. What is the key difference between that and a full electronic health record?</p>

          <from> Mr. Derek Tierney<recordedTime time="2025-07-16T09:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_26">If we think about a shared care record, the main differentiator is that it is a longitudinal record that starts to connect fragmented records across the system in order to provide a unified view to those who are receiving care and those who are providing it. What we call an enterprise electronic health record, in the first instance, is to provide that level of functionality. Second, at a much deeper level, it is effectively about automating the patient journey in order that from the time a person receives his or her first intervention, the care plan is being automated and planned for at the next level or stage. Let us say that on the basis that we have a full enterprise electronic health record <i>in situ</i> when a person arrives at a GP or even into an accident and emergency department, his or her next steps are already being preplanned. His or her labs are being ordered-----</p>

          <p eId="para_29">What is the difference between what will go live in the children's hospital and the summary care records that will be used across the remainder of the health service? Will that involve integration with GPs and community care facilities or will it just be an EQ system?</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_16">
          <from> Mr. Derek Tierney<recordedTime time="2025-07-16T09:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_30">The shared care record definitely involves integration across all care settings where a person's health information exists. In other words, information relating to GPs, pharmacies and hospitals. There is little data being collected in the community because it is predominantly a paper-based system. We have a plan to create some capability in community care. If we think about it, the electronic health record system in the children's hospital is a full digital record from the time a child is admitted for care for paediatric services until he or she is discharged, whatever his or her condition or need is. It is very deep, and it automates his or her plan. That is the difference. If I was talking about our ambition to implement an electronic health record at national level, I would ask the Deputy to think about the children's hospital but on a national level.</p>

          <p eId="para_31">I have a final question. In the North, two of the health trusts - the western and southern trusts - went live with electronic health systems in May. Has Mr. Tierney engaged with colleagues in the North? Has he had a look at their systems? I think it is the Epic system that is in use there.</p>

          <p eId="para_32">It is. We are very fortunate because if we think about it from the perspective of the children's hospital, we must think about that ease of integration between what we are deploying there and paediatric services in the North. Then, we start opening up the possibilities of all-island paediatric care. That will be the game-changer. That is the opportunity.</p>

          <p eId="para_33">With regard to records that are already in place, some, although not all, of the maternity units have computerised records. The first four involved began doing this five years ago. Can the electronic record relating to a baby born in a maternity units be passed on if that child is subsequently brought to the children's hospital 12 months later? Will such records be capable of being passed on in computerised form rather than by means of a paper file?</p>

          <from> Mr. Derek Tierney<recordedTime time="2025-07-16T09:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_34">At a minimum, a shared care record will allow minimum access to health information wherever it is in the system. If the question is about whether we can we pick up a baby's electronic record and ingest it into the system within the children's hospital, in theory, yes, we can. However, we have to work through matters in terms of interoperability. Going back the first part of the Deputy's question, the committee will be aware that Limerick maternity unit went live on the maternity HR system just three weeks ago. That is a major milestone because it sets us on a path to get 70% of all births on a maternity HR system. That is great news.</p>

          <p eId="para_41">The other issue I want to ask about is with regard to the number of systems. In Denmark, they were down to 25 systems about four years ago. They are now working towards having five systems. My understanding is that between all the hospitals, GPs and pharmacies, we had something like 1,700 different systems. What is the number now?</p>

          <p eId="para_42">I will tell the Deputy where we would like to get to. We would like to get down to one system nationally, which is that relating to our enterprise electronic health record. We have developed a business case. We are engaging with our colleagues in the Department of public expenditure and reform for support for investment to start the programme in that regard. The matter is under active consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_43"> We have thousands of discrete independent systems throughout the health service. The challenge is to connect them. The way to do that is to start replacing them over time with a shared care record that is longitudinal and that takes information out of those hundreds of systems to provide a unified view and, in time, replace this with an enterprise electronic health record. The goal is to get down to one system. In fairness to the authorities in Denmark, they have been at this for 30 years. We have only really started.</p>

          <p eId="para_44">If we go back to the maternity services, on the basis that when a child is born and an electronic record is being kept from the start, the question is about the priority of getting every maternity unit to operate an electronic system. Mr. Tierney referred to a figure of 70%, but it is about moving forward from there. The issue is the timescale we were talking about whereby if we have 70% that are electronic and 30% that are not, this will cause its own problems even if they are transferred.</p>
          <p eId="para_45"> There is another issue I want to raise. I was speaking to a general doctor recently in one of the largest hospitals in Dublin. He informed me that he spends 50% of his day chasing down X-rays or scans for patients and trying to get them on to their files. It is about getting all those records on to a patient's file once the scan or X-ray has been performed. How far along are we in trying to achieve that goal?</p>

          <p eId="para_47"> Going back to the Deputy's previous question about how long it takes to roll out an electronic health record, as Deputy Cullinane pointed out, the North has been successful in this regard, but that was on the basis of an eight-year programme. These things take time, particularly as we have to standardise work practices and workflows and then digitise the information using an electronic technology platform. We are under no illusion; this takes time and effort and commensurate funding That is where we are at the moment.</p>

          <p eId="para_54">That is the ultimate goal and what we are trying to get to. This is going to be a staged process over time. As we said, we started with the maternity hospitals, the children's hospital and the national rehabilitation hospital have this measure. This is about making this the complete system for all healthcare interactions. The whole purpose is to get to the point where a person’s care is available to whichever provider he or she turns up to, whether in a scheduled way such as transitioning from paediatric to adult services or in a more organic way, such as when a person has had a trauma or an accident and turns up at a different hospital. The same record is individualised or personalised to that person and should be available. That is going to take us some time, not only to integrate the different systems between acute, paediatric, adult and community, but on a regional basis and in terms of how we stage that securely, effectively and reasonably throughout not only the different elements of the healthcare system, but the regions of it, along how we stage this. What the Deputy is describing is our goal.</p>

          <p eId="para_55">This is no reflection on the Minister, but about ten years ago I sat in the Department of Health and we talked about all of this and very little has moved. If someone is in the children's hospital and reaches the age where he or she has to go to the adult hospital, are those systems integrated? That is my first question.</p>
          <p eId="para_56"> I understand there are sensitivities around procurement but there are only one or two big systems around that we are talking about. My second question is again on IT. We mentioned general practitioners. GPs have been 95% computerised for the past 25 years, since the year 2000. We know that from the chronic disease management programme. In order to participate in that programme, one had to be computerised. There is a 95% uptake of GPs. In fact, we were talking to 40 GPs who operating an old system. There is a great dependence on one or two companies. One company dominates the GP space. There is great concern that if that company for any reason - I am not suggesting it will - became vulnerable financially or otherwise, or was sold out of the State, this whole network of the only part of the health service that is fully computerised and paperless would collapse. This is a question not an opinion but would it not be a worthwhile project to look into the HSE and Department taking over the national GP, and integrating it with the rest of the health service?</p>

          <p eId="para_58">I take the Deputy’s first question. The scenario he is presenting is a child or patient in CHI receiving care, and after reaching the age of 18, he or she needs to receive acute care in St. James's Hospital. for example. I will answer that in two ways. The purpose of this Bill is to ensure that the patient's data is accessible and follows him or her on his or her care journey. We are here today to make sure we at least establish a legal underpinning, obligation and duty to share, to allow us live through that duty of care. At a practical, technical level what I would say is that the national shared care record in the first instance allows both the patient and the caregiver in St. James's to have access to a minimum level of information from the CHI system to understand what the patient need is and what care has been received to date.</p>

By extension, I am thinking of dental services and the integration of public health records and records held by private hospitals. What is the shareability?

Part 3 of the Bill sets out the categories of information we commit to providing for each citizen. The digitalisation is a huge detail of the enterprise system and will take many years. The Bill facilitates the interoperability of data from different systems to consolidate information into summary care records for all citizens.

At a technical level, when I look at our shared care record, all information is up for grabs. If there is information a GP system needed for a person's care, we do not distinguish between private or public. We are giving effect to the Bill and how we get access to data, whether it is a publicly or privately provided service. I expect the private sector will be knocking on my door looking for publicly held information, particularly diagnostics and images, so it will cut both ways.</p>

It is predominantly paper based and we do not have any maturity around digital systems, digital technology or data collection systems in our community settings. Therefore, there is a gap. While our longer term plan is to roll out a national electronic health record, we recognise there is a need to deliver some capability to the community in the interim. This is what community connect is. It is a solution to bridge a gap in time until we get to the final state, which is an enterprise national electronic health system. We have now commenced a programme where we are using an existing framework to start to deploy an existing solution into the community, into mental health in the first instance, widening to palliative care and then widening it again to wider community services. The vendor is currently delivering a solution for us. I would say it is a mid-tier vendor and we are exploiting that framework to roll that out into the community, to bridge a gap and fill a need they have.</p>

          <p eId="para_84">We have loads of time. I have three quick questions. When we look at the scale of what needs to be done even to get to the shared care records, we have multiple service providers across acute, primary and community. I do not underestimate the challenge. We have multiple systems. Am I right in saying that initially at least we are looking at interoperability of multiple systems? Following on from that, has the Department met any challenges or resistance in getting to that space?</p>

          <p eId="para_86">I will try to set out what the shared care record is from a technology perspective. If we think about it, it is a black box and all it is doing is connecting into those existing systems the Deputy talked about. It is not about forcing systems to talk to each other. It is dropping down into each of those systems, pulling out the relevant information and connecting it so that patients and healthcare providers are seeing that combined unified record as it exists within the system in separate parts.</p>

          <p eId="para_87">The reason I asked the question is that when we look at other European countries and indeed the North - we just talked about that - they have single system of electronic records with full bells and whistles. That is a single system, but we are not talking about that. If our objective is to move to full electronic health records, would that require a single system?</p>

          <p eId="para_88">It would. That is what we are ultimately getting to, but this has to be a transition. There is no other practical way of doing it. I very much hope we will be having this conversation in a number of years from now and that we are talking about a single system as other countries in Europe have. While not all have managed to do it, those that have managed to do it have begun this journey a little earlier than us and we want to end up in that space.

I know the system in the North cost over €1 billion and other European countries have spent a lot of money.

The purpose of Bill is to make sure there is no ambiguity regarding the sharing of information about the patient. That applies to all things. It is necessary that the voluntary hospitals implement this. For example, the integrated financial management system, IFMS, is already an essential part in making non-pay savings. I expect to see the voluntary hospitals do that enthusiastically where that has not yet been done. I would expect them to co-operate with this as well because they are being paid for by the State.</p>

          <from> Mr. Muiris O'Connor<recordedTime time="2025-07-16T10:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_101">Part of the fragmentation in our health information landscape has arisen from the public, private, voluntary nature of the Irish system. There was not always an enthusiastic willingness to share data between voluntary and public, and between private and public. There were instances where voluntary hospitals entered into data sharing agreements with the NTPF which required them not to share that data with the Department of Health. We have ironed out those issues. I can detect and see very considerable progress through a data access group.</p>
          <p eId="para_102"> The section 38 hospitals, as a group, have engaged with the complete refreshment of data sharing arrangements with the HSE. They recognise the importance of connected health. They recognise the European move to centre it on citizens' rights to have their health information connected, irrespective of where they get the data. Although not yet enacted, the Bill is having a very positive influence on the commitment to share. It is vital that we operate as a coherent system. The sharing of care records from different sources, as we have spoken about, is now supported in legislation. There is a clear legal basis for the sharing.</p>
          <p eId="para_103"> There are much stronger powers for the HSE to require data, to specify the categories of information it wants and crucially - I think the Deputy was picking up on this - the standards to support interoperability. The beauty of it is that the interoperability we seek will not just unify health information in a connectable way here in Ireland, but will have it connected across the wider 27 member states of the EU and associated countries that plug in. Therefore, we can really transform this quickly from what I would regard as very poor behaviours at times around data sharing. I am confident that we are really getting places now. The productivity dashboard that the Minister spoke about took about 18 months of work, trying to renegotiate data sharing and trying to secure the reporting in sensible formats to bring that visibility to the productivity and performance in health and social care so we have a unified system.</p>
          <p eId="para_104"> We are engaging with the private hospitals. They have not all been co-operative but we are working with them to ensure we get a citizen-centred approach, which while rather agnostic to the site in which the healthcare is delivered, captures the data arising.</p>

We are in the digital age now and whether we like it or not, it is fair to suggest or for me to think it is worth bringing all the systems together and channelling or filtering that information about one's file such that wherever an accident or emergency might occur, at least that information can be tapped into. Easy access means early intervention and that primarily should be where we are trying to get to.</p>
          <p eId="para_107"> I had a number of questions and have been saved the task of asking them because previous speakers have posed them so I am not going to go back over that. I anticipate resistance, maybe, by some to engaging in this process. Sometimes people are afraid the information might be used for the wrong reason or that outside parties might have access to that very confidential and private information. Does the Minister anticipate resistance in that regard due to fear of the information getting shared or will it be managed such that only those who have a need to access it can get hold of it?</p>

          <p eId="para_110">We are very respectful of the personal rights of individuals and how their data is held and managed. There is a need to hold data electronically for the purposes of providing care, but there are certain guardrails put around who may access that data and on what basis. At the next level when we are looking at how we share and consider data on a more collective level, for health research for example, clearly all that is anonymised and is at a completely different level. In the same way everyone benefits from the changes made to organ donation on the basis it might be the Deputy or it might be me but we all benefit collectively, we all benefit from sharing information not just in Ireland but with Europe in a completely anonymised way for health research purposes and for innovation purposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_111"> From the perspective of hospitals, I am afraid resistance really is not option. Resistance is futile, in the words of the Borg. To be clear, the State pays for hospital care and it does not matter whether it is a HSE hospital or a section 38 one. The State is the entity paying and all of us are the people who are responsible for that. It is like being slow on integrated financial management systems. It is really not acceptable. This is what we are doing. We are providing a legal basis for how that may be done. There should be no ambiguity about this. This is what is happening.</p>

          <p eId="para_119">On the assurances patients have, the Bill provides a clear assurance for them to access their information to ensure that for the purpose of direct care, only health professionals with a direct and legitimate interest in their care can access it. Echoing the kind of commitments coming from Europe, patients will be able to obtain information on any others accessing their information. In time you will be able to see your information in a summary care record, but you will also have a log of others who have access and you will see it is your GP, your GP nurse and so on. Patients will also be able to raise concerns or anything like that. There is a huge amount built around the assurance and the trust, which is vital in this space because health information is very personal information, but it is vital it be available to health and social care professionals in different settings. There is a great amount of assurance and a really solid, clear legal basis. We will work to maintain the trust and confidence of the population.</p>

          <p eId="para_120">To be clear, the guardrails are set out in section 12 of the Bill. It is important to say we are very respectful and concerned about individuals and their privacy. There are a couple of elements to that. One is that we need them to be in the electronic health system so they can get the quickest possible and the best, most integrated care. If you turn up to a hospital with a major trauma and have a complex medical background, you need the people who are caring for you to be able to access your complete information. Nevertheless, you are also entitled to the protection of your data, how that is managed, how it is shared and who can access it.</p>
          <p eId="para_121"> Part of our responsibility is the security side of this. We are quite aware of the scale of the cybersecurity attack on the health system that happened. That it happened during Covid, I always felt, somewhat masked the seriousness of it because there was so much disruption in the health system as a consequence of Covid. When the cybersecurity attack then happened at the same time, very significant disruption occurred as a consequence. I often felt people did not really attribute the disruption to the scale of the attack that happened here. We are very conscious of that in how we approach this. This is a live concern, not just for the Irish system, the current system or the future system but right across the EU. We hear of increasing concerns, especially in the eastern part of Europe, about how health systems are managed. We are very aware of that and we are taking every possible step we can on that side of things. There is a balance here. The individual is protected and respected in every possible way. We have set out the guardrails and the way in which that can be done, in section 12 in particular. Then there is a very different perspective in respect of hospitals more generally. They are funded by the State, they participate and that is it.</p>

          <p eId="para_125">We have asked where we would like to get to ultimately and how we can get there in a stepped way. Earlier this year we launched a HSE patient app, which was about putting information we can currently get access to into the patient's hands so we can start empowering them to take responsibility for themselves and take an interest in their health and well-being.</p>
          <p eId="para_126">The second step is to, as I said earlier, mobilise a shared care record, which is about looking to what we have, how we can dip into it, pull it up and connect it in a unified way so that we have a minimum level of information to be able to give back to a patient through the app or through their healthcare-giver, wherever they are in the system. Longer term, we would like to get to an enterprise electronic health record, which would cater for the need of every person on the island and of every healthcare provider who has a stake in providing care for the patient. As I mentioned in response to Deputy Sherlock earlier, one of the intermediate steps, particularly around CAMHS, is how we can exploit existing technology and roll it into primary care community so that we can, for instance, start understanding how we digitise CAMHS, palliative care and other wider primary care services. It is to bring all of that jigsaw together ultimately. </p>

          <p eId="para_127">I will just add that the app is really important. While the Internet signal is historically terrible in committee rooms in the basement in LH 2000, it is an app you can download. You need a MyGovID to sign in. Obviously, I expect everybody in the room has downloaded it and is part of the group of 80,000 people who have committed to registering their personal health information. The functionality of it would be easier to see were the signal slightly better in the committee room, but I have talked to people who have downloaded it and they can see, for example, all of their medications on it. Sometimes taking complex medication can be difficult. It can be hard to manage, especially when you turn up to a new healthcare provider, to describe what your medication is and what that happens to be. If you log in with your MyGovID, which is secure, you will be able to see locally, wherever you are, where the emergency care centres are and what the primary care options are. You can also see your vaccination record, from both a flu perspective and a Covid perspective. I was embarrassed to realise that there was a bit of gap between my vaccinations and I will not let that happen again this year. You can see your records. It started out being piloted on the maternity side and people could book appointments. We are rolling out increased functionality all of the time. We will get to the point where you can book appointments - where you will need to book appointments - through the app. I would encourage everybody to get it, because this is stage one of this electronic health record, to the extent that Members can put it in their newsletters or email updates to their constituents. If we are going to get to an electronic health record, certainly everyone in the Oireachtas needs to download the app but we also need to start encouraging people to do that. I hope they will see the increased functionality over time and that they will begin to see some of the benefit of it. That is stage one so please go for it. </p>

          <p eId="para_128">Deputy Cullinane raised the issue about cost and there is an important question about controlling costs in the development of this. However, we also need to look at savings that will be achieved by having the system there. I referred to Denmark earlier. Back in 2004, Denmark worked out that they were saving about €1.5 billion per annum because of their computerised system. I would imagine that if we have a fully computerised system, it will be a huge saving.</p>

The Deputy is right to identify the savings and I will ask Mr. Tierney to speak more to that. I visited the National Rehabilitation Hospital recently. Everything is computerised. There are little trolleys where staff input at the bedside the details that need to be there for the whole system. There is a saving in that it will free up staff's time and facilitate staff in being able to recall records. I have also visited archive rooms in hospitals right across the country. These are rooms that are down around the back of the hospital, in some room far away, and unfortunately we are now requiring hospital staff to find physical files and bring them back. That all takes time, particularly when someone presents in the accident and emergency department. There is a huge time saving that is a cost saving. I will ask Mr. Tierney to speak more to this.

          <p eId="para_133">The reason I am raising it is that I was dealing with an incident where someone who had come in from Germany had a psychiatric problem and was admitted to hospital. The person would not give their consent. He was on medication but the German authorities would not release his records. The doctors could not work out even what medication he was on, to such an extent that he had to be transported back to Germany, accompanied by two healthcare officials, because they could not manage him here. The big issue was that they were not allowed under the German system to access his records. </p>

          <p eId="para_134">Let me answer that. There are a few questions rolled up in this so I will try to unpick it if I can. The purpose of the Bill is to ensure a minimum level of health data is captured for the patient's benefit so that when he or she needs intervention, the healthcare provider has a minimum level of information from which to work. At the moment, if I arrive at an accident and emergency department in which I have never been treated before, those who are providing me with first intervention do not know who I am, what my need is or what medication I am on. They do not even know what my history is. Think about the time they spend just to get a basic diagnosis of what is being presented in front of them. If we think about digitising health records, the primary benefits are increasing safety and quality of care to deliver better outcome. On the time-saving piece, I am sure Deputy Daly would agree healthcare professionals would rather spend more time providing face-to-face care than documenting the care they are giving. It is about being equipped with a capability to free up precious, valuable time in the context of giving care rather than administrating paperwork on that level of care. As the Minister says, one of the secondary benefits is the time saved and realised in the overall system. Time costs money and, therefore, there is a productivity saving and a cash release gain, ultimately. Any way we have looked at an enterprise EHR, the benefit-to-cost ratio makes absolute sense here. There is no argument about it. </p>

          <p eId="para_142">I ask Deputies to support the amendments in this grouping to ensure all health service providers as defined under the Bill are empowered to collect and record patients' PPSNs. Our health system needs a robust and proven identifier so that health information can effectively and reliably be associated with the correct individual. That is essential for care and treatment and patient safety. As part of this, the Bill aims to enhance patient safety through stronger identified patient processes including best practice use of the PPSN and eircode to uniquely identify patients. In that context, the individual health identifier, IHI, was provided for in the Health Identifiers Act 2014 as a unique identifier for health services. The IHI was designed and developed to enable the unique identification of a patient across healthcare services. Since the enactment of that legislation, the HSE has been embedding the IHI in health information programmes and locations across health services. However, in order to enable the full benefits that IHIs can bring in terms of quality, safety and efficiency, the IHI match rate needs to be as close to 100% as possible. Evaluation of those match rates shows that those health systems that are already collecting and recording the PPSN have significantly higher match rates than those systems that do not. It is also important to recognise that the health systems are part of the wider public service ecosystem, including the national digital strategy. For example, the national data infrastructure, which has been developed as part of the Civil Service renewal plan and the public service ICT strategy, includes the PPSN. It is one of the three trusted unique identifiers, along with eircodes and unique business identifiers, to facilitate the sharing and aggregation of data on a public service-wide basis to support digital services. </p>
          <p eId="para_143"> Amendment No. 11 amends the reference to the PPSN under the patient summary.</p>
          <p eId="para_144"> Amendment No. 13 provides for the insertion of a new section mandating a health service provider to record the PPSN of his or her patients and associate the PPSN with any record of the health service provider they make in the provision of health service to that patient. It also empowers a health service provider to request a patient provide his or her PPSN, empowers the HSE to use a PPSN to identify a patient in order to identify and link the patient's health information to his or her electronic health record, and mandates a relevant person to provide the PPSN of a patient where the number is requested by the HSE and they have that PPSN in their possession. </p>
          <p eId="para_145">The patient cannot be refused a health service solely because they have not been allocated or issued with a PPSN or because they are not in a position to provide it. That is really important. </p>

People are particularly precious about giving out their PPSN. We have had data breaches in the past. In the HSE, we had a cyberattack. Even online, there are lots of scams designed as emails that people get asking to send on a PPSN because it is valuable to scammers. It is important those protections are in place. My fundamental point is that transparency is really important as we roll this out. Trust is really important. We have had a very poor culture of giving health information in the past. It is something we have to change. We have to change the public's attitude as well as systems within the HSE. We all have to be leaders in that space. We have had such resistance in the past, sometimes rationally and sometimes irrationally. If I am told there is an individual health identifier that is obviously important but that I cannot access or where there is no way of me finding out what it is, that could raise concerns or suspicions. If it can be integrated into the app or there were some mechanism to allow people could find it, that would be important.</p>

          <p eId="para_177">As Mr. Tierney said, the IHI legislation had a number of keys, namely, forename, surname, date of birth, gender and PPSN. If people do not know their PPSN and do not have an issue with it being looked up, their surname, date of birth and a few other bits of information can be used to identify them and proceed on that basis. </p>

          <p eId="para_179">Yes, exactly. There are edge cases where we do not expect somebody to have a PPSN. It takes four to five weeks to generate a PPSN for a newborn baby. The IHI has been developed to be available almost at the point of birth. There would be one lined up in the maternity ward for babies. </p>

          <p eId="para_200"> As other members have said, all of this is very exciting. There are a lot of benefits to what is being done here. The framework published last year was a very good and an important piece of work for the health service. I fully support it and I want to see its implementation. The committee has discussed this issue a number of times over a number of years. We had what I would describe as a tense or difficult session with the Secretary General of the Department and his officials. There had been pushback from the Department of public expenditure against rolling any of this out. The Minister might recall some of that. It was controversial at that time. We want to park all of that and move forward. We have the new strategy and a new plan. There are lots of moving parts to this. It would be useful to impose an obligation on the health system to come back in a number of years with a progress report setting out where we are. Some progress has been made since we met in 2023. We got that information today and it is all very worthwhile and commendable.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">It is important for us, as a health committee, to keep track of it, particularly given the advantages we have discussed to patients, the healthcare system and so on. Will consideration be given to that? I know these amendments are routinely put down for Bills and are very often not accepted for all sorts of reasons, but given that we have a strategy and there is a lot in this legislation that we all want to see progress and of which we are all supportive, it would be useful to have a report and then a meeting of the health committee to look at what progress has been made. That is the purpose for which the amendment is intended.</p>

          <p eId="para_202">I totally understand the intent of the amendment. I have drafted amendments along this line for the same reasons in various contexts. Section 6 contains a provision that "The Minister shall review or cause to be reviewed ... no later than 5 years", but that is not what the Deputy is suggesting at all. I understand what he is trying to achieve and the need for it. This should not require a statutory basis. I should do this review anyway, in co-operation with the committee and proactively, and then offer it to the committee, rather than being required to do it by statute. There is a shared interest in making sure this happens.</p>
          <p eId="para_203"> I note that the Department of public expenditure and reform is now the Department of Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation. I am quite sure, therefore, that officials in that Department share the sense of urgency I have about the need to ensure that electronic health records progress efficiently and in a well-funded way. Members might take the view that they wish to interview officials from the Department of public expenditure, and potentially the Minister, should they find it necessary. I am making the best business case I can in the national development plan review for doing this in a staged and managed way that achieves this outcome in the coming years. I will have no difficulty coming before the committee at any time with a report. I am not sure we need a statutory basis for that and, on that basis, I will not accept the amendment. We just need to do it anyway.</p>

          <p eId="para_206">I certainly agree that we need to put pressure on the Department of public expenditure and reform, whether it is the Minister or the officials, because there has been pushback. I submitted freedom of information requests on this subject. I have read some of the responses. Other officials in previous hearings would be aware of some of the concerns. I understand those concerns because there has been a number of scandals with digital systems. PPARS, for example, seemed to have paralysed the health service. Never again will we go anywhere near it. We have to move away from that.</p>
          <p eId="para_207"> When we are spending money on very costly systems, we have to get it right, which is why discussions like this are important in order that people can fully understand what we are doing, what we are getting, what the benefits are and how much it will cost, although cost is somewhat sensitive if procurement processes are in place. There is work to be done with regard to the Department of public expenditure and reform. It and the Department of Health are not fully aligned. If we, as a committee, can help in any way to push the former Department on, we should play a role.</p>

          <p eId="para_208">I welcome the Deputy's support. I despise having to correct the Deputy, but that Department has responsibility for public expenditure, reform, infrastructure and digitalisation, so I think the Department's enthusiasm for this project is overwhelming. The Minister, Deputy Jack Chambers, has been a really strong advocate for electronic health records. Not to tell tales about the programme for Government discussions, but the Minister is very committed to health digitalisation. Why would he not be, being a qualified doctor and having worked in that system? He is very committed to it and enthusiastic about it, as are the Taoiseach and Tánaiste. Recognising the importance of this project to the State, through long-term cost savings, management of public expenditure, the impact on the current budget, being able to track expenditure through the IFMS and the integration of all these different things, it is an imperative for the Department of public expenditure, reform, infrastructure and digitalisation. I am sure the Department will be as enthusiastic and co-operative with this committee as I am.</p>

          <p eId="para_209">I will add one final point to that. We also had very lengthy discussions in this committee on health spending. Through FOI requests and leaked information, we learned about meetings between officials from the Department of public expenditure, reform, digitalisation and officials from the Department of Health regarding the deficits that were in place for a number of years. The Minister might recall that. There were very sharp differences between that Department and the Department of Health. Later amendments will deal with the tracking of health spending. We routinely submit parliamentary questions on issues and are told that the HSE does not collect data or does not have the data. The more we digitise the health service, the more data we will get and the better we will be able to help everybody. A data-rich health service is one of the best ways to get productivity in the healthcare service.</p>

          <p eId="para_212">I agree with the Deputy. There are a couple of pieces to that. The IFMS system is essential in us tracking spending in HSE hospitals and, crucially, voluntary hospitals. Some of the deficit issues exist on the voluntary side. It is therefore even more important that they are enthusiastic about bringing this in and enabling us to track the consistency of spending, including the cost of a hip transplant in St. James's Hospital versus somewhere else. That is really important. Where we have managed to achieve some progress on that is the productivity dashboard. That shows the value of transparency in hospitals. It perhaps removes some of the myths about one hospital or another and looks at the actual productivity in different specialisms and gives us a real way of analysing that over time. Of course, it requires time to analyse that on a hospital-by-hospital or specialism basis, but at least we have the capacity to do so now. It should be the same with the financial management system.</p>
          <p eId="para_213"> I wish to make a clarification that I should have done earlier. Mr. Tierney has very helpfully checked and there is a way for people to get their IHI at the moment. People can email <i>hids.info@hse.ie</i>. They can do it that way if they wish but I still think it would be preferable to have it on the app.</p>

          <p eId="para_214">I welcome the Minister's commitment to review because this will take considerable expenditure and up-front investment for efficiencies down the line. We have to be careful we do not beat ourselves over the head. We look to the NHS but it cannot be set up as a model. The NHS had a £10 billion issue with its national IT programme between 2010 and 2013. It started in 2003. The NHS was already computerised before that. This is a fraught exercise. There is risk in it, but we have no choice but to push forward. Case studies have been done on the NHS issue over the years. One of the lessons from it is that it is about working from the bottom up, taking small steps, not using a top-down approach and carrying out regular reviews of what is happening. It appears people got into silos. They got defensive about the particular pieces of work they were doing on the system, but approximately £10.1 billion, which is maybe £13 billion, was spent and the NHS still does not have full buy-in from all its trusts. I take Deputy Cullinane's point about the Six Counties, but at the end of the day, this is a difficult, complex exercise. I understand and welcome the work on it.</p>

          <p eId="para_253"> Amendments Nos. 18 and 30 are technical amendments replacing the term “health services provider” with “health practitioner”. Upon review of the published Bill, it appeared there were a couple of instances where the term “health practitioner” might be more appropriate than “health service provider” as it is more precise and better aligns with the use of the term “health professional” under the EHDS regulation. </p>
          <p eId="para_254"> Amendment No. 41 is a technical amendment deleting the term “health services provider” and substituting “the executive” instead. That seeks to correct an error in the published Bill as it is the HSE that is required to retain a record in respect of when a health services provider accesses restricted information including the reasons for so doing. </p>

          <p eId="para_255">A lot of questions arise from this. It is more about getting clarity. We spoke earlier of the need for buy-in and trust. It is important that we tease out in which circumstances a person would not get access to data. These sections relate to withholding data for people in certain circumstances where it “has reasonable grounds for believing that such access would be likely to cause serious harm to the physical or mental health of the patient concerned.” We will get to that first. However, in relation to practitioners, it refers to “where there are factual indications that disclosure would endanger the vital interests or rights of the health practitioner”. I will wait for the Minister’s response, but we have had a lot of issues recently relating to CHI where patients had to go to the courts and on the steps of the courts were provided with information and data they needed. Clinical reviews are ongoing into the practice of some clinicians in that hospital. That happens at times, unfortunately. We do not want to be withholding information that would protect the interests of the practitioner. What I am trying to understand here is how tightly the sections of this Bill could be applied. What is meant by “vital interests” of the healthcare practitioners? Can we have examples of why access would be denied on what are called “reasonable grounds for believing that such access would be likely to cause serious harm”? What scenarios are we talking about here?</p>

The legislation is very determined to ensure that the citizen has full comprehensive rights to access their own information. We are just creating a bit of latitude in the Bill. For instance, if a diagnostic test or a scan for a cancer came through, the health practitioner might wish, for very good reasons, to have a direct personal conversation with their patient in advance of the information being immediately uploaded to their record. That is an instance where it would be appropriate to personalise the information and engage appropriately with the patient. Those are the circumstances. They would be very limited circumstances in which -----</p>

          <p eId="para_258">Does it prescribe those kinds of instances? Mr. O’Connor says a bit of latitude, but sometimes a bit of latitude means you can drive a horse and carriage through it. In circumstances like the ones Mr. O’Connor just explained, there may be a rationale, but the concern is that a medical practitioner would not provide the information because in their view it was protecting their vital interests as opposed to protecting the interests of the patient. We talked about guardrails earlier. What are the guardrails here to make sure no unintended consequences might flow from that section? </p>

          <p eId="para_260">We are probably looking at two different scenarios here around restrictions. One is around a health service provider or heath practitioner restricting access to part of the electronic health record for a period of time. Mr. O’Connor gave the example of where there might be test results that have come back but where the conversation on the impact and implications of those test results has not been had. The provision there is very much about restricting as briefly as possible and only what is necessary and proportionate. Without wanting to pre-empt other amendments in this session, another amendment draws from data protection regulations, re-emphasising the point that that restriction should only be in respect of that particular part of the electronic health record. It should not be interpreted as a blanket restriction across the electronic health record. </p>

          <p eId="para_261">Ms O’Connor might put herself in the shoes of a patient for a second. If a patient is looking for the information and, in the scenario Ms O'Connor has painted, the medical practitioner believes they need to have a conversation with that patient first, is that then communicated to the patient immediately to say the reason they cannot be given this is that the medical practitioner wants to see the patient? How does it work in practice? </p>

          <p eId="para_262">I agree with the Deputy. As he says, it is a really important reflection. He can see what we are trying to achieve here but we may not quite have struck the balance. I might bring in a slight tweak on Report Stage that makes it time limited or time bound because the purpose is not to restrict access to personal information but to ensure that information is given appropriately, sensitively and not in a damaging way rather than restricting access. If the Deputy will let me reflect on it, I will come back on Report Stage, perhaps with a time-bound period, to make sure we are achieving what we intend. </p>

However, that right can be restricted by the HSE in exceptional circumstances where there are factual indications that any such disclosure could threaten the vital interests of the health services provider or the patient. These amendments seek to correct an omission from the published Bill and provide for an explicit power to make regulations to allow the HSE to restrict the application of section 14(1), and this again is subject to consultation with the Data Protection Commission. </p>

          <p eId="para_337"> This section provides that electronic health records may be used by health service providers for the purposes of care and treatment and also be used by the HSE for specified public interest purposes. This provision aligns with the EHDS regulation in providing for the data contained in electronic health records to be used not only for direct care and treatment but also for secondary purposes. As in the published Bill, these specified public interest purposes mirror those contained in Part 4 of the Bill. Clearly setting them out here, however, seeks to clarify that this provision applies across all sectors, public, private and voluntary, regardless of the arrangement entered into within the HSE. We discussed some of this context a little earlier.</p>

          <p eId="para_374">I move amendment No. 57:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_375">In page 20, to delete lines 8 to 14.</p>
          <p eId="para_376"> This Bill complements and builds on data protection legislation, including the GDPR. Section 21 of Part 4 provides for a number of procedural and processing safeguards in respect of the HSE's use of its power to mandate the provision of health information. These safeguards must include proportionality, data minimisation, purpose limitation and transparency measures. Amendment No. 57 seeks to serve a number of purposes, including reducing any confusion in respect of the definition of "relevant person", as well as better alignment with the EHDS regulation, which does not make a distinction between public and private healthcare or in terms of its definition of a "health data holder". This amendment also seeks to avoid duplication in respect of the necessary safeguards for requests under Part 4 to be necessary and to be proportionate. The Bill also provides that a request under Part 4 must be relevant, necessary and proportionate for the purpose in relation to which the request was made. Additionally, amendments Nos. 57, 59, 60 and 62 seek to provide clarity on the purpose behind Part 4.</p>
          <p eId="para_377"> In practical terms, the understanding of the definition of and requirements for "pseudonymisation" vary significantly across the sector. The Bill's text as drafted could be confusing and its interpretation could frustrate the intended benefits of data sharing, so we need some clarification. According to GDPR definitions, "anonymised data" is not personal data and cannot be associated with an individual, while "pseudonymised data" is personal data and allows for data linkage to using identifiable data if and where needed. Amendment No. 61 provides that the HSE shall adopt suitable and specific measures to safeguard the rights of data subjects when processing personal data and this may include limitations on access to the data undergoing processing to prevent unauthorised collection, consultation, alteration, disclosure or erasure of the data, strict time limits for the erasure of the data and mechanisms to ensure such time limits are observed, specific targeted training for those involved in processing operations and technical and organisational measures to ensure respect for the principle of data minimisation. These suitable and specific safeguards are not intended to be exhaustive. My Department has engaged with the Data Protection Commission on these amendments and the HSE is required to consult with the Data Protection Commission on suitable and specific measures it proposes to adopt. </p>

The relevant section of the patient safety Act includes provision for the extension of HIQA's power to carry out an independent review of a defined type of serious patient safety incident where some or all of the care of the patient was carried out in a nursing home. My Department was advised by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel that a minor technical amendment is required to ensure that public nursing homes are covered by this provision as well as private nursing homes. The amendment is currently with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting and I am signalling my intention to introduce it on Report Stage.</p>

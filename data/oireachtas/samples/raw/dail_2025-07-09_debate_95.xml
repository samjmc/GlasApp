          <p eId="para_10">Good morning. Thank you for being here. Today's meeting will be in two separate public sessions. The first session is to conclude at 10.45 a.m. Apologies have been received from Deputies Pa Daly, Grace Boland and Michael Collins. Senator Mark Duffy has allocated his speaking slot to Deputy Emer Currie. Deputy Pa Daly has allocated his speaking slot to Deputy Paul Donnelly. Deputy Grace Boland has allocated her speaking slot to Deputy Maeve O'Connell. A number of Deputies have indicated that they wish to speak in the spare slots towards the end of each session.</p>
          <p eId="para_11"> The purpose of today's meeting is for the joint committee to discuss unmanned aircraft systems. Witnesses' opening statements will be made in the following order: the Irish Aviation Authority, Dublin City Council and, not least, Maynooth University. Today is all about engagement and considering an issue that is both timely and rapidly evolving, which is the growing presence of drones in Irish society. As Chair, I begin by acknowledging both the potential but also the real concerns that this technology brings. On the one hand, drones offer clear and innovative opportunities. On the other hand, with that innovation comes genuine, understandable public concern around safety, privacy, noise pollution and the broader regulatory environment. People ask who is monitoring this, where drones can fly, what happens if something goes wrong and, crucially, how we balance the benefits of this technology with the rights and expectations of members of the public. There is also a wider national interest to ensure that Ireland is ahead of the curve in building a framework that encourages innovation, but not at the expense of public trust or safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_12"> Today's hearing brings together a diverse group of voices from regulators to local authorities, academic researchers and industry leaders. That is exactly what we need. Our goal is not just to listen but to understand what is working, what gaps may exist, and what steps need to be taken to ensure responsible and transparent drone integration in our society. With that, I look forward to an open and constructive discussion and I genuinely thank our witnesses for their time and presence here today.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">On behalf of the committee, I am pleased to welcome from the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, Mr. Enda Walsh, manager of the unmanned aircraft systems, UAS, division in the organisation, and Mr. Jim Gavin, chief operations officer. I call Mr. Gavin to make his opening statement.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_2">
          <from> Mr. Jim Gavin<recordedTime time="2025-07-09T09:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_14">I thank the committee for inviting the IAA to this meeting and to contribute. The IAA regulates the aviation sector in Ireland. I joined the IAA in 2011 as a flight operations inspector in the airlines standards division, with my last aircraft type rating on the Airbus A830 family of aircraft. Since then, I have held various senior management and regulatory roles across flight operations, airworthiness, air traffic services, airspace management, aviation security and unmanned aircraft systems. I hold an airline transport pilot's licence and have over 30 years of experience in the aviation industry. I am a former commissioned officer and military pilot, with over 20 years of service in Óglaigh na hÉireann - the Irish Defence Forces - at home and overseas. As the Cathaoirleach mentioned, I am joined by Enda Walsh, manager of the unmanned aircraft systems division within the IAA. He has worked in aviation for 14 years, with a background in UAS, airspace and aeronautical information management, instrument flight procedure design, air traffic control and software engineering. Mr. Walsh joined the IAA in 2017 and represents it on the UAS technical advisory body of the European Aviation Safety Agency, EASA, and the broader global regulator co-ordination body, the Joint Authorities on Rulemaking for UAS, JARUS. He is a former commissioned officer, with 13 years of service in Óglaigh na hÉireann - the Irish Defence Forces - where he served in both the Air Corps and the infantry, again at home and overseas.</p>
          <p eId="para_15"> The IAA is the single regulator for civil aviation in the State. The IAA’s remit includes economic regulation, consumer protection, as well as the regulation and enforcement of civil aviation, security and safety, which includes regulating unmanned aircraft systems, or drones as they are more commonly referred to. Ireland has led the way in the regulation of this sector, being the first state in Europe, and one of the first worldwide, to introduce drone regulations in 2015. The national regulation was superseded by European regulation in 2019, and the European Aviation Safety Agency keeps pace by advancing the European regulatory framework, which governs this technology. The IAA is proactive and a respected contributor in the related European working groups and task forces, bringing our experience and safety focus to these rule-making processes.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> The role of the IAA is to ensure drone operations are conducted safely in compliance with the EU regulations. European aviation regulation details the rules by which drones may operate within the European Union. This regulation applies uniformly throughout the EU and the IAA, as the competent authority, ensures it is applied effectively within the State. The oversight and regulation of drone operations is risk-based. This means that the more complex the drone operations, the more requirements and safety mitigations required to ensure their safe operation and the safety of the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_17"> Drone operations are broadly classified into three categories based on risk: open, specific and certified. The low-risk open category, for example, includes the smaller, off-the-shelf drones used for recreation, photography or smaller survey operations, whereas drone delivery operations fall into the medium-risk specific category, which requires an explicit authorisation from the IAA. Higher risk certified operations are not yet in effect, but are expected in due course. They will include air taxis, international cargo and high-altitude operations.</p>

          <p eId="para_18">I am going to have to ask Mr. Gavin to conclude. I think all the witnesses were told there would be three-minute opening statements. </p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_4">
          <from> Mr. Jim Gavin<recordedTime time="2025-07-09T09:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_19">I thank the Cathaoirleach. As stated earlier, the IAA conducts oversight of all civil drone operations in the State using this risk-based approach. In addition, the regulation requires the IAA to classify and analyse all drone-related occurrence reports, whether mandatory or voluntary, and any safety trends, and share this relevant information with European regulatory bodies, regulated entities and the public. </p>

          <p eId="para_21">If I may conclude, a Chathaoirligh, drone operations continue to grow and innovate across Europe and in Ireland. Today, more than 8,000 drone operators and 23,000 remote pilots are registered with the IAA. Drone operations, such as building inspections and surveys, photography and deliveries are routine and commonplace daily activities across the State but represent only the beginning of the advancement and innovation possible with this technology. The IAA understands the commercial appetite for future growth, as was mentioned, innovation and opportunity with the expanding use of drones for societal, recreational and business purposes. However, first and foremost, the IAA is the aviation safety regulator - independent, effective and competent - and it does not compromise on the regulatory safety standards to be applied.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> We will continue to conduct safety oversight of all drone operations in Ireland, as we have done for the last ten years. We will continue to promote drone safety with the public and take enforcement action when required. We will also continue to contribute proactively to constructive rulemaking nationally and internationally and work closely with both the Government and local authorities to support and shape the continuing safe evolution of this technology. I am happy to take questions.</p>

          <p eId="para_23">I thank Mr. Gavin. Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative they comply with any such direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex to participate in public meetings. I will not permit members to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement. Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting. In this regard I ask members partaking via Microsoft Teams that, prior to making their contribution to the meeting, they confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> From Dublin City Council, I welcome Mr. Paul Rutherford, principal environmental health officer, air quality monitoring and noise control unit; Mr. Thomas Curran, manager, land surveying and mapping division and corporate drone unit; and Ms Edel Kelly, senior transportation officer, transportation planning section. I invite Mr. Curran to give his opening statement on behalf of Dublin City Council for three minutes</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_8">
          <from> Mr. Thomas Curran<recordedTime time="2025-07-09T09:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_27">I thank the committee very much for the invitation to appear here and share the experiences of Dublin City Council's with the UAS drones ecosystem in urban areas. The Cathaoirleach has introduced me and my colleagues.</p>
          <p eId="para_28"> Dublin City Council has been using drones to aid the provision of our services for the last eight years or so. The primary users of drones within Dublin City Council are the survey and mapping division, Dublin Fire Brigade and the Civil Defence. The main uses of drones within Dublin City Council are the production of topographical surveying, mapping, production of 3D models, emergency response, dangerous building-roof inspections, flood defence monitoring, search and rescue and video and photography for our media office. The use of drones has resulted in significant improvements in staff safety, especially in and around dangerous buildings, a reduction in time on site and, importantly as well, the improvements in our cost efficiencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> Dublin City Council produced a Drone and Urban Air Mobility 2024–2029 strategy that highlights the potential of the emerging drone sector for Ireland and recognises Dublin City Council’s role in supporting the wider ecosystem and building capacity for innovative services within the public sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">The strategy states that scaling these services will depend on public trust, awareness and early engagement to address concerns around safety, privacy, noise, and environmental impact, ensuring long-term acceptance and benefit for communities. One of the key components of the strategy was the creation of a dedicated corporate drone unit based within the survey and mapping division, which supports services mentioned previously - training requirements, management of drone equipment, regulatory knowledge and overseeing any relevant procurement processes.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> Dublin City Council has been collaborating and exchanging knowledge with other European cities through being a member of the Urban-Air-Mobility Initiative Cities Community, UIC2, and the POLIS Network, which are key European platforms supporting cities in the safe and sustainable integration of drones and urban air mobility. UIC2, under the EU Smart Cities Marketplace, helps local authorities align drone initiatives with public needs and EU policies, while POLIS promotes knowledge exchange and policy development to ensure drone use supports wider urban air mobility and sustainability goals. We are also members of the recently created Irish public service drone network, a group set up to share knowledge and experience among local authorities and other public service organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> As with many new and emerging technologies, Dublin City Council will continue to explore and examine how these can enhance service delivery and benefits to citizens in accordance with the corporate plan and the Dublin city development plan. We are in the process of arranging further engagement and consultation around drones in the city and plan to host a series of community engagements to discuss issues outlined in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_33"> Dublin City Council, through its smart city and survey and mapping units, established a drone innovation partnership with Maynooth University and the IAA in October 2024, which is co-funded through Research Ireland. The objective of the partnership will be to shape the future of drones and urban air mobility as well as playing a key role in providing the basis for regulated integration of innovative technologies such as drones into the daily lives of the citizens of Dublin and Ireland. The main workstreams of the project are a digital platform, stakeholder engagement, demonstrators and the governance framework. </p>
          <p eId="para_34"> There has been a lot of media coverage over the past while. Dublin City Council recognises that the commercial use of drones, such as for deliveries, is a complex and evolving situation as the technology itself is moving so fast. There is no published policy, legislation or guidance at a national level for local authorities and this creates significant challenges. For clarity, no commercial drone delivery companies are operating over the Dublin City Council area. Dublin City Council is aware that there are drone delivery companies operating in the greater Dublin region. Dublin City Council's planning and transport planning teams confirm that no planning applications in relation to drones have been lodged with Dublin City Council to date. I have included in my submission links to the strategy, information on the drone innovation partnership project and short videos.</p>

          <p eId="para_35">I thank Mr. Curran. I welcome Professor Tim McCarthy from the Department of Computer Science at Maynooth University and invite him to make his opening statement. </p>

          <p eId="para_36">I have over 12 years' experience of drone research. We are funded primarily by Research Ireland, formerly Science Foundation Ireland, and are involved in applications and traffic management systems. Normally, Ireland ends up following other people in terms of technology and how we do things. This is probably one of the first examples of where technology has come in together with this innovation piece and conspired to present this challenge to us, so we should seize this as an opportunity instead of viewing it as a negative. Having said that, there are real issues here with which we must contend. </p>
          <p eId="para_37"> Regarding the drone ecosystem, what we are looking at is the wider issue involving not just technology but applications, innovation, dealing with societal acceptance, fairness and trust. The biggest one is uncertainty. With this technology and innovation coming into a close space with humans, uncertainty is hanging around. When we mix high-volume movement of drones with people, there will be issues with that. Drones out in the countryside do not really cause problems. It is only when there is a high volume of drones in cities, although I know there are other aspects we are looking at here. </p>
          <p eId="para_38"> There is a multiagency aspect here too. It does not just involve the Department of Transport and the IAA but also involves local authorities, data protection, environmental matters and An Garda Síochána so we must bear that in mind. When we talk about large-volume drone movements in urban areas, we are looking at traffic management systems. Some of these systems are still under development. Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2021/664 of 22 April 2021 underpins what is called U-space, which is the airspace system for drones, and that is still under development. It is worth saying that when we move into the stakeholder and wider issues, that is critical. We certainly have to do more. We have parallels and analogues to look at in Australia, Canada and the US. Canada has established a drone advisory committee, which is something we could look at. It brings in this multiagency piece, deals with these issues and has policies and task groups. Australia has a drone information website that deals with all those pieces involving raising awareness, educating people about the benefits of drones and, equally, trying to handle people's concerns. The website has a page saying "have your say". </p>

          <p eId="para_55">Let me be clear; I am from Dublin West and this is no small, local matter. Dublin 15 is being used as a test ground to launch commercial drone operations nationally and globally. The decisions the Government is making now will shape how home deliveries and drone technology will develop now and into the future. My first question is: does Mr. Gavin accept we currently do not have an integrated regulatory framework when it comes to commercial drone operations? As was said, regulations focus on air and ground risk and do not take residential amenity into consideration. All four Dublin councils operate under a combined noise action plan, based on the EU environmental noise directive. However, drones appear to fall outside this framework. Is it correct that drone noise is not currently monitored or mapped under this plan? Which authority, if any, is responsible for monitoring drone generated environmental noise?</p>

          <p eId="para_58">I will comment on the regulation piece. For the avoidance of doubt, the IAA's remit with drone operations is the safety and security of those drones. That is our lane we have to ensure the drone is operated safely. For example, if you own a drone that is more than 250 g in weight and has a camera, you need to register with the Irish Aviation Authority. That is our responsibility. The other matters the Deputy mentioned are probably for the Department of Transport.</p>

          <p eId="para_59">I thank the Deputy. I am the principal environmental health officer, EHO, with the noise control unit. The current legislation that deals with noise control is the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992. Section 108 of that legislation cites what is a noise nuisance but under section 108(4)(<i>a</i>), it says this section shall not apply to aircraft. Under that legislation, we cannot deal with noise complaints about drones.</p>

          <p eId="para_61">It is very true when you look at this because it crisscrosses quite a few sectors and Departments. Remember too that when we look at drones, we operate and align with what goes on in Europe and with the European Union Aviation Safety Authority, EASA. That is where we are at. When you look at its constructs, they do not really go into this area of nuance, privacy impact and noise. It mentions it. The regulation, Regulation 2021/664, which underpins U-space is not quite comprehensive enough. As we said at the start, Ireland is at the forefront here. The Deputy is right; it is something we have to deal with very quickly. We do not have adequate governance or legislative instruments in place to handle this at this point.</p>

          <p eId="para_64">I thank the witnesses for the presentations. I live about 700 yd or 800 yd away from the drone base in Millennium Park. I walk the park every day, so I see the drones every single day. There are currently six drones - they added one in the past couple of weeks - and because I am not part of the flight path, it does not directly come over our house unless it is delivering next door to us but it comes in that general direction. We hear them every day.</p>
          <p eId="para_65"> To echo some of the previous questions, there is a real concern in Dublin West around the delivery service. No one has any issue with the Garda, Civil Defence, the delivery of medicines or defibrillators and all these things. They are really good and really useful. The huge concern is not just where it is delivering now and the six to ten drones that are currently delivering commercially at the moment, but it is around the way this will impact into the future. They are currently impacting now. If you are in your house and your windows are closed, you might not hear them. If you are in your garden, if you are right next door or someone is getting a delivery two to three gardens away, it is very noisy. There is no denying that. I do not know whether the witnesses have heard them in their gardens but they can be heard.</p>
          <p eId="para_66"> I have a couple of questions on it. Noise is a massive issue but privacy is another one and I will go back to a very serious incident that happened several years ago with gardaí. There was CCTV footage of a very distraught person who was suffering serious mental health issues. It was recorded by a phone from the CCTV. That was shared on WhatsApp and was sent widely. It was fairly well nationally and internationally known. My real concern is that the potential for that to happen. If you are in your garden and someone takes a video of you from their drone, that is an issue. I know it is a GDPR issue and not necessarily related to this. Does Manna have exclusive use of the airspace? We were told Fingal County Council wanted to put up a drone in the Millennium Park and were refused because Manna had exclusive use of that airspace. Is there a maximum number of drones allowed by the IAA for the likes of this delivery service? If Manna decided tomorrow it wanted to put 100 up in the sky, is there a maximum?</p>
          <p eId="para_67"> In some other countries, you have ownership of the space above your property. I know Manna will say that you have an option to opt out of it. Do we have any ownership of the airspace or the height above our property?</p>

          <p eId="para_68">In terms of the airspace, the airspace is a State asset. The State owns the airspace. That is the first thing to say. In terms of the use of the airspace, any drone operator can use the airspace in the Deputy's locality. There is an arrangement between the air navigation services provider, ANSP, AirNav Ireland and Manna Air Delivery. The ANSP requires what is called a "geo-zone" to be in that block of airspace but any drone operator can operate in that area.</p>

Mr. Rutherford pointed out the issue whereby noise pollution controls cannot apply to aircraft and, therefore, cannot apply to drones. There is a commitment in the programme for Government to the introduction of a framework policy. The Minister spoke about that in the Dáil when I questioned him a number of times. Has Professor McCarthy had any engagement with that process? Does he feel, from what he has seen, that policy framework will fill the gaps? The four areas I have always been concerned about are the safety of the drones, privacy, noise and the planning issues, or the question of planning permission. Does he feel that the proposed policy framework the Government is working on will address those four areas?</p>

I would love to see more advancement in technologies for monitoring and securing our territorial waters.

At Maynooth, we are involved with Dublin City Council and Dublin Fire Brigade. We have an exercise coming in a few weeks that will look at that. We are also working with the Irish Coast Guard and are in discussions with Dublin Port as well. We were with the Coast Guard in Rossaveel last November to look at the role of drones in search and rescue. That balance has to be struck. I will not comment on the job potential.</p>

It is reported that they are clearly audible but brief and are as loud as a person talking or a dishwasher operating, and that there is a momentary rise of 7 dB at the delivery stage, which is roughly the level of a distant household vacuum cleaner or washing machine.</p>

The IAA issued a light UAS operator certificate permitting the use of sub-bases at junction 6 and Clonsilla and a main base at Blanchardstown Shopping Centre for commercial drone operations.

They broadcast over Wi-Fi and Bluetooth their operator registration ID, height, location, etc. That information can be scanned by anyone with a mobile device using a variety of free apps. That is very useful for the public to know for the purpose of reporting occurrences or reporting to us.

          <p eId="para_112">I understand. It entails a risk-based approach to regulation, depending on the size and complexity. If you were to buy a small drone over the counter, there would be, depending on its size, set operating distances from people and buildings. The distance can go up to 150 m. It depends on the drone and the operation itself; there is no specified distance.</p>

          <p eId="para_141">Before I hand over to Mr. Walsh to give more detail, I will say that there are operations where you have to keep your drone in sight and there are what are called "beyond visual line of sight". We have given approvals, such as the case you have given there, where drone operators can operate their drone beyond the visual line of sight. Mr. Walsh can complement that with more detail, please.</p>

          <p eId="para_142">We spoke about the three broad risk categories. In the open category all operators are required to keep the drone in visual line of sight. That is being able to see the drone and also being aware of the surroundings and to understand what is underneath it and what is around it in terms of other aircraft. In the specific category you can have beyond visual line of sight operations. These are quite common throughout Europe. We assess the air risk and the ground risk before issuing an authorisation, but to do beyond visual line of sight, you do need specific authorisation from ourselves.</p>

Listening to the contributions so far, we do not really have any limitations on noise, we do not have any limitations on the number of drones that can fly in open airspace and we do not have a lower limit that drones can fly at. It does sound more like a bit of a wild west and a completely unregulated area.</p>

What we can point to is what some others have done, and we mentioned this at the start, and not just the USA but also Canada and Australia, in doing practical things in ensuring we have good governance at the top. That is pointing to policy and to strategy and bringing the regulatory alignment, but also looking at those nuanced issues and codes of practice right through to stakeholder engagement. Doing a practical thing, we might consider setting up an advisory committee so it is not left to one body to carry the heavy lifting. Those issues mentioned are not easy ones to sort out. We are not going to sort them out here today, but we could do these practical steps that have been done in other jurisdictions, be at the front line here and show the way rather than us in Ireland usually following others.</p>

From a safety and security perspective, there are strict regulations that drone operators must comply with.

The local authorities and planning authorities are acting within a vacuum. The appropriate place for that consultation or engagement would be with our development plans, as they come. However, for us to be effective in that regard, we have to have this national policy that we then bring in to our city or county plans. In the absence of that, we cannot really do this from a bottom-up point of view. We need this to come from central government. We really are working within a vacuum. The planning application lands with Dublin City Council and it is very difficult to deal with.</p>

          <p eId="para_154">I want to go back to the Irish Aviation Authority regarding radar infrastructure. There is a radio wave pinged to an aircraft and it positions it at a given time, horizontally and vertically.

          <p eId="para_156">A total of 80% of all transatlantic aircraft are coming into Europe and are not all landing in Ireland, but they are flying over Irish airspace through Shanwick over that Woodcock Hill radar. I have already made the point that drones could compromise this, and the IAA has lots of signage in and around that radar station cautioning that drones should not be used. The elephant in the room is that there are a lot of wind farms being planned for in this area - fixed infrastructure that rotates and can affect the efficacy of that radio wave pinging up and back to the aircraft. What is the Irish Aviation Authority position on that?</p>

          <p eId="para_157">The Deputy mentioned the volume of transatlantic aircraft that goes through what is called Irish-controlled airspace, not so much over Irish sovereign airspace. Certainly, 80% of those aircraft do not fly over Woodcock Hill. Off the west coast of Ireland there is half a million sq. km of airspace that is controlled, as the Deputy mentioned, by Shanwick, which is Shannon and Prestwick, under the 1996 agreement. That is just to clarify that particular point. Regarding operating drones in the environs of a radar head, no more so than with manned aviation, it is the operators' responsibility not to operate that drone or manned aircraft in an irresponsible manner. As my colleague Mr. Walsh mentioned, there are limits and distances you need to operate a drone away from buildings, facilities and people. If we are aware that a person is misbehaving and using their drone in an unsafe manner, we can initiate proceedings against that individual.</p>

Yet, the drone gets packed away into a bag and is taken home again. There is fixed infrastructure - antennae, aerials, masts, turbines - all going up in this area and potentially compromising Irish airspace and the efficacy of radar and potentially compromising air safety.</p>

          <p eId="para_177">I thank the Chair and all the witnesses. My time is very short. I am one of the people living under the experiment and guinea pig situation in Dublin 15. I think we all agree with drones for civil defence, topography, delivering medicines and all that. What we are talking about is drone delivery by commercial companies for fast food and coffee. It seems to me, by what I am hearing today, that the IAA is responsible for the safety of the drones. The councils will not take any complaints about noise. The Department of Transport will not either, so we have a situation where residents whose lives are dramatically impacted by these drone deliveries have no recourse. That is what we are saying here today. Is that correct? The other issue is that there are no residents even represented here today.</p>
          <p eId="para_178"> Professor McCarthy said there should be societal acceptance. Would he not agree that we need a higher bar than that assent and approval of the airspace over our houses and back gardens suddenly being invaded by drones?

          <p eId="para_179">In short, it is a multilayered cake but I will cut to the chase here and point to a societal acceptance task group in Canada, for example. In its terms of reference, it went out and asked what it would look at. It was enforcement of applicable regulations, concerns about safety, trust in drone operators, threats to privacy, understanding the drone industry, drones at source and so on. I am saying we have to be more proactive here in engaging with neighbourhood groups.</p>

For example, if there is a planning application for a building, people such as councillors, etc., can write in and make their submissions, but there is no recourse at the moment for residents living under these drones.</p>
          <p eId="para_181"> One other issue is jobs and the economy. Professor McCarthy gave a figure for 145,000 jobs in the EU and €4.5 billion. Does that include the military and defence?</p>

          <p eId="para_206">Cathaoirleach and members of the committee, it is a genuine honour to be here. I am here on behalf of Manna Air Delivery, an Irish commercial drone delivery company at the forefront of a technological revolution. Manna has become the recognised world leader in the fledgling drone industry. With the support of the Irish State, through the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, and Enterprise Ireland, we are expanding rapidly. We have already created more than 160 jobs in north County Dublin and we have the potential to become the next CRH, Kerry Group or Stripe. We are in the business of taking vehicles off congested, polluted and dangerous roads by moving commercial delivery to the skies. The traditional model of road delivery is not just unsustainable; it is increasingly slow and inefficient for our growing population.</p>
          <p eId="para_207"> We design and build autonomous electric aircraft in Glasnevin and Moorock, County Offaly. All of our research and development is conducted in Ireland and we have invested tens of millions of euro in these efforts over the past five years. Drone delivery offers a faster, greener and safer way forward while fully respecting the privacy of the communities we serve. In Dublin 15 alone, our flights have removed 3,500 kg of CO2 every month. We generate just one eighth of the CO2 of the equivalent road-based delivery.</p>
          <p eId="para_208"> On noise, yes, drones produce a sound that is noticeable. Leading experts in acoustics science from Trinity College Dublin assessed our aircraft and found that while cruising at 65 m, they emitted just 57 dB, quieter than a conversation, for ten seconds as they pass overhead. We have developed and tested new technology that is 40% quieter again and we are awaiting regulatory approval for full deployment. We continue to invest significantly in technology to become quieter. We foresee a future where people will barely hear drones at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_209"> We are fully GDPR compliant. Our drones do not store or record images or video. A small camera is used to ensure the safety of the area we deliver onto.</p>
          <p eId="para_210"> When concerns are raised, we listen. Since launching in March, we have done more 34,000 deliveries in Dublin 15. At the start of the year, we had 53 complaints. Entering last week, we had a total of 120 complaints in Dublin 15, with 22% of complainants being active users of our service. Every single inquiry has been addressed, often face to face, and by me personally. We are listening and not shying away. This is about jobs. We have created more than 160 high-tech, high-value jobs in Dublin - people paying their taxes in Ireland and a company investing in and paying its taxes in Ireland. We power 45 small business in the Dublin 15 area, which are thriving because they can reach customers quickly and safely.</p>
          <p eId="para_211"> We worked with the Dublin Fire Brigade and the National Ambulance Service to launch a defibrillator pilot in Dublin 15. As per the professor of cardiology services in the HSE, if we roll this technology out nationally, we will save 900 lives per year with it. During the Covid-19 pandemic, we saw at first hand how drone delivery can serve vulnerable and isolated members of the public. Our team worked with residents in Moneygall to safely deliver medicines and essential goods to medically vulnerable households when traditional access was limited.</p>
          <p eId="para_212"> We know that trust must be earned, not claimed. We welcome oversight, regulation and community conversation. This is not about replacing what is good. It is about making things better, safer, greener and more accessible and equitable for everyone. I thank members for their time and attention. I welcome questions.</p>

          <from> Dr. Gerard Dooly<recordedTime time="2025-07-09T10:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_214">I thank the committee for the invitation to speak today. I am an associate professor at the school of engineering at the University of Limerick and director of the centre for robotics and intelligent systems. I lead all drone operations at the University of Limerick under its operator licence and manage a large cohort of qualified pilots under various categories. For over a decade, our work, supported by EU and Irish national funding grants, has focused on real-world drone applications across emergency response, environmental monitoring, offshore energy and industrial inspection. I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Anthony Weir, one of my primary pilots and field operators.</p>
          <p eId="para_215"> This meeting comes at a time when public awareness of drones is rapidly growing. Recent developments have sparked debate, particularly regarding the frequency and noise of drone delivery operations. While these concerns are understandable, I stress that the technology itself is not the core issue. The real challenge lies in how we regulate, deploy and engage with the public on the use of drones in a way that supports both innovation and community well-being. Globally, we are witnessing a decisive shift in how nations are embracing drones, not just as niche tools but as mainstream infrastructure. In the UK, a £2 billion investment was announced just a few weeks ago to expand drone capabilities across defence and civil applications. Both the United States and Canada made significant announcements in recent months and are accelerating drone innovation, largely through deregulation and investment to promote competitiveness. Across Europe, member states are investing in U-space corridors, digital air traffic services and innovation zones to co-ordinate safe integration of drones into airspace.</p>
          <p eId="para_216"> Ireland should not fall behind. Through the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, and within the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, EASA, framework, Ireland has a strong foundation for drone regulation. Regulation must evolve alongside adoption. We have the opportunity to improve the responsiveness of licensing processes, expand the IAA’s capacity for regulation and, ultimately, support the operators who are working to comply with complex technical requirements. Public education and awareness campaigns can also go a long way towards demystifying drone use and helping the wider population understand the benefits and obligations tied to responsible operations. We can also do more to increase awareness among general aviation pilots, who must understand and respect the realities of operating in shared airspace.</p>
          <p eId="para_217"> Drones are not just for delivery. They are reshaping agriculture, construction, habitat monitoring, infrastructure inspection and emergency services. They reduce risk, lower emissions and create high-value jobs. With the right supports, Ireland can lead not just in flying drones but in building the smart, safe systems they rely on.</p>

It is up to us as legislators to push for better regulation and for the Government to provide it. Does Mr. Healy accept that the test period in Dublin 15 needs to end and that we need an integrated regulatory framework that deals with the legitimate concerns of the community which have arisen in the past 12 to 18 months and people's lived experience of commercial drone operators? Why did Mr. Healy choose Dublin 15?</p>

          <p eId="para_220">On why we chose Dublin 15, to be clear this is our sixth operation in Ireland. We started in Moneygall. We were then in Oranmore, and then Balbriggan, and we are currently in Dublin 15. Dublin 15 is a great example of a typical European high-density suburb with huge traffic problems and thriving businesses but pockets of retail areas in particular that suffered post-Covid. It was a great example, we thought, to have a good production run, not a trial. We do not consider it a trial. If we stopped it, we would simply be out of business. We would look at the 35,000 people we deliver to in Dublin 15 and we would be disappointing them if we walked away. I still get letters every week from people in Balbriggan-----</p>

          <p eId="para_222">In the company's noise report it is claiming a baseline of 52 dB for Dublin 15. I am wondering where that baseline has come from. Is that based on somebody's back garden?</p>

          <p eId="para_223">The baseline is 59 dB and 57 dB in Dublin 15. It came from testing the acoustics. Dr. John Kennedy, who is associate professor of acoustics at Trinity College, is an expert in measuring these devices. I saw some questioning of the report earlier, but this is a well-known methodology for testing drones flying by. I noted the member of Dublin City Council measured its drone in an open space. We did not. We measured it flying over streets, culs-de-sac and busy areas where you will get reverberations from buildings. This system is well known and used on the EASA side to quantify the noise impact of the sphere of influence of a drone flying overhead. It is a very scientific and well-proven method.</p>

          <p eId="para_225">It is the responsibility of Government, not private business, to legislate and the failure of Governments over the past couple of years to legislate on this is the reason we are all sitting here. We are not here talking about defibrillators and medicine but the commercial end of drone delivery and its impact on residents. Should Manna not hold off scaling up until legislation with proper guidelines is in place? How many drones does the company plan to put into operation this year and in 2026 and 2027? On noise, if I am sitting in my garden and a drone delivers next door to me, what is the maximum decibel level? If a car is driving past, walls will block the noise. With a lawnmower, most gardens have concrete walls on both sides that block the noise. In the case of a drone, however, it comes directly down over your head.</p>

          <p eId="para_228">It is just to have spares. With aircraft, there are maintenance issues and if there are any questions, you use a spare. We only have permission to fly four drones out of the shopping centre right now.</p>
          <p eId="para_229"> On gardens, that is the big one. I have one great example of a cul-de-sac of ten houses, nine of which are using the service and one that is not. I had a complaint from that one household. We fully accept that we need to have a debate on this area and we need regulations on the particular use for drones. I have no objections to that; in fact, I would embrace it.</p>
          <p eId="para_230"> On the point about decibels, when a drone arrives overhead it descends to 15 m, which is the noisiest part of the process. It is pretty loud - I will admit that - at about 59 dB. We will bring that down to about 55 dB with our new propellers and mass production.</p>
          <p eId="para_231"> If I may follow up on Deputy Currie's question because I missed part of it, the level is not 52 dB today. That is our target for when we reduce the weight of the aircraft, have new propellers and go to 80 m altitude. Right now, it is over 52 dB; is actually 57 dB.</p>

          <p eId="para_239">In European airspace we are all mandated by a common regulation which is derived through EASA regulations. We are harmonised and while the UK follows a lot of the same regulations, it is slightly different. I guess in other countries it is different. With delivery drones, the situation that is occurring with noise decibels has happened in other countries. In Australia there were significant issues with the noise of drones. Operators there were refused planning. They moved location.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">In the US, there were issues. They moved location. It is not a new issue that is coming up. It has happened in other non-European countries. The operator employed some of the mitigations after they were refused planning. There was significant backlash from the public. They would have looked at changing out props. They would have looked at adaptive control systems for when they are under way versus when they are hovering. They would have looked at moving flight altitudes when under way up to 85 m, perhaps. This is similar to what is being looked at here. Some of the other issues they would have looked at include vibration reduction on the frame and on some of the motors, as well as engaging with the community, that is, transparency and community engagement. There are various things around public engagement, such as showing people what the noise is at different levels. They also mapped their noise across different levels - not just after reaching a 65 m zone when they are on their way but also at 15 m, where they are actually dropping the goods. There are actions. It is mostly best practice that other operators have done in non-EU countries. </p>

          <p eId="para_242">I have learned with greater conviction that Ireland is the right place to do it. We have generally a business-friendly community, Government and a robust regulatory environment that provides a lot of clarity. I wish we had had better regulations from both a planning point of view and a societal acceptance point of view. I wish that was developed further. There is nowhere in the world that has that. The only place that does have it is Australia. Would we have been better served in Australia? Maybe, because Google's draw and delivery programme has been there for more than ten years. They have led the way with this. Most of what I have learned is that we have been lacking clear policy on what companies like us are going to be doing. I wish we would have had that earlier. </p>

          <p eId="para_272">On the issue of the noise, when I speak to residents, they are of the view that their back garden noise would be around 40 dB to 46 dB. We have been contacted by some residents in Glasnevin where it is 43 dB and upwards. The baseline that Manna is using its research references 52 dB as standard urban noise, whereas back gardens seem to be much lower than that. With a lower baseline based on a back garden, the noise of either 57 dB to 59 dB at a flyover or 10 dB above that when it is hovering in someone's garden is dramatic. Does Mr. Healy take that on board?</p>
          <p eId="para_273"> Going back to the test language, we have heard that Dublin 15 has been a testing ground. We need regulations for this to continue.

          <p eId="para_298">We have had significant engagement with all the local communities we have flown in. In Dublin 15 alone, I have spoken at Fingal Chamber. We had multiple members of this committee over to our base recently. We had engagement in the local tennis club. I have personally visited four of the local schools. In total, we visited, I think, ten of the local schools. To be clear, we do not fly over schools during school hours, nor do we fly over hospitals. We have had significant engagement. We did multiple flyer drops to every single eircode in the community before we began the service as well. We also have a lot of information on our website that people can download and read. We have had significant community engagement, and that is ongoing and increasing. I personally am involved. When we get a complaint email or a question from one of the constituents or residents, I would usually be involved in that answer.</p>

          <p eId="para_301"> I specifically ask about an application Manna has in for a drone base in Dundrum, which is adjacent to Holy Cross Church. In the absence of planning and regulations, it is up to Manna to decide where a good base is. Is it appropriate to try to place a base right next to a church, where there will be bridal parties arriving with buzzing drones and funerals leaving with buzzing drones? In addition, in that area, there is an outdoor ice rink in the winter months, and in the summer months, we have the Dundrum street festival. How was that location chosen? Were those issues taken into account?</p>

Humour aside, I am from that area. We will reach my house with the service. I know many people and businesses in the area. There is much pent-up demand for the service. We have wanted to come to Dundrum for a long time. The choice of location is primarily around the businesses there. As a simple principle, we never fly over large bodies of people. For example, when the ice rink is there, we will not be operating. When there is a wedding or funeral going on, we will not be operating or we will fly away from it. We are well aware of that and we have a process of being aware of events or public bodies of people so that we will not fly over them.</p>

Much of our research would be habitat mapping with NPWS or BirdWatch Ireland, or even offshore energy mapping for birds off the shore or the coast. We do a lot of habitat enforcement and mapping in that sense. There are many uses for drones. When we look at investment in other countries, there is significant investment now going on and much of that would be in defence, but much of it is also in civilian use. When we see civilian developments in drones going on in other countries, it has benefits across many sectors. There are developments within civilian applications like these rolled out into developments and benefits for other sectors.</p>

Looking at what we have in the context of Ireland Inc., we have the Marine Institute, which covers the marine aspects. In the US, there are multiple organisations looking at the technology development. The Marine Institute would primarily look at some technology elements but it would also be primarily focused on science. Within Ireland, we lack technology development for robotics, which would be a hub. We engage with all of the various sectors within Ireland, including defence, the Coast Guard and all of the various blue light services and even the DAA in Dublin in terms of management of airspace there. There is a benefit to offering a national hub for that. There are national hubs for marine in the US such as NOAA and WHOI. There are multiple comparable research centres of excellence in other countries in the technology space.</p>

          <p eId="para_319"> Manna begins its statement by saying its business is taking vehicles off congested roads, but that is not its business. Its business is drone delivery for profit. One of the issues - it is the big issue - is noise. It is not just decibel level that is a problem with noise. According to the EPA, there are different components, including tonal, but the multi-rotation of the propellers that are associated with drones creates a lot of noise. According to Manna, it is quieter than a conversation. First of all, if I am out in my back garden, I do not necessarily want to hear continual conversation taking place that I did not invite. I have here a recording of one drone over my estate and I think the witnesses will agree that it is not quieter than a conversation. Sorry, I am encountering another technology glitch.</p>

I made a point about CCTV and an incident to the people who were before the committee previously. I spoke to Manna directly when I went to see Manna about it. There is an opportunity and a fear among people about a done flying over the house. It is 15 m up, it drops, the CCTV is bleeding in and people are looking at that. Obviously, Manna's employees are looking at this situation. Are there protocols for doing its employment contracts that prohibits them in terms of the GDPR?</p>

We have what is called a remote pilot, which is one of our staff in Glasnevin, who would be one single person who can see that camera footage for about ten seconds. The person is not able to record the screen from the software we have. We are fully GDPR compliant and we have been independently assessed on that basis, so nothing is recorded, there is no ability for our pilot to take a screenshot or anything like that, and it is part of the training for when we onboard a new pilot.</p>

          <p eId="para_376">Yes. There will be certain different materials, that is, moving from stainless steel leg brackets, for example, to aluminium leg brackets. It would be a change of material, but with some of those changes, we would need to get regulatory approval. It is not a fast process because safety is the number one priority. We would put any such changes through thousands of flights before we would put them into production. It will take us time.</p>

          <p eId="para_377">I will take a step back. What I would like to know is where is the conversation being had about how much of the movement of goods that currently takes place on our roads is appropriate to move into our skies. When I visited the base, Mr. Healy showed me the map of all the journeys his company had done. If Manna had a competitor that wanted to compete with it in this field, for example, if Amazon decided to start doing deliveries with drones here or if An Post decided to provide a drone delivery service, we would suddenly have two, three or four different organisations using our skies. In fairness, it is not Manna's job to answer that question. It is a national question we have to ask.</p>
          <p eId="para_378"> In all of this, we are tied down in the details - the noise and planning details are important - but there has to be a space to ask the bigger question of how many drones in our skies are too much. I do not have the answer, but that conversation is not taking place anywhere. Does Mr. Healy know if it is? It has not come out of this conversation today. That is a gap that needs to be filled. Primarily, it is our job and the Government's as legislators.</p>

          <p eId="para_416">The issue is that this is a massive change in technology and in people's lives. We all agree that road transport can create poor quality of life, inequality and so on. The question is whether we want to transfer that to our skies. The most powerful argument that has been made by a resident is to ask whether our skies will become as busy as our roads? From the previous session here, the IAA regulates the safety of the drone operation. The councils do not take any complaints about noise, so there is a massive gap and problem for residents who are impacted. It is not the only complaint but it is the main complaint. All they can do is send a complaint to a private company that is causing the noise, that is profiting and that is not accountable to people. I believe absolutely that Manna should not be allowed to operate in this framework where there is no accountability or transparency for residents.</p>
          <p eId="para_417"> One of the issues the Manna representatives talk about is the environment but they tend to talk about the last mile. Obviously, there is an environmental impact from producing drones, from warehousing and from single-use coffee cups, which is a big feature of Manna's business and other drone delivery businesses. That is not talked about at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_418"> The other issue is that Manna is teaming up with Deliveroo now, so it will take jobs away from Deliveroo riders, migrant workers, but that is never mentioned in the talk of job creation.</p>

          <p eId="para_421">My question is to Mr. Weir from the University of Limerick. I know we are talking about drones today but I refer to the maritime aspects. How does the University of Limerick marry maritime and air drones, and what can it do to benefit Ireland Inc.?</p>

          <p eId="para_422">As regards the marriage between aerial robotics and surface and subsea robotics, as a nation, we will see that when we look at not so much the commercial entities but the national entities: defence, forestry, agriculture, the Coast Guard. When we look at these entities, and primarily with the marine, the aerial aspect of this would be the inspection and the monitoring of offshore structures. The subsea aspect of this is the monitoring of our subsea structures. These subsea structures can be offshore power generation, offshore power conduits, subsea cables and subsea communication conduits. How do we actively monitor these and how can we actively and predictably monitor what is happening to these, be it malicious or just regular maintenance? That is where the marriage would come. The aerial drones would monitor what is happening above the water and the subsea drones would monitor what is happening within the water column and what is happening to our assets on the seabed, be they-----</p>

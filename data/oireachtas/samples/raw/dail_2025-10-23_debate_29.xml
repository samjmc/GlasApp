          <p eId="para_10">You are all very welcome to today's meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts. Before we proceed, I have a few housekeeping matters to go through. Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 226 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies. Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I remind members of the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex. Members of the committee attending remotely must do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.</p>
          <p eId="para_11"> The agenda for today is to discuss accounts and statements, correspondence and upcoming meetings. We will then suspend and begin the engagement with officials from the Department of Justice, Migration and Home Affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_12"> Two sets of accounts and financial statements were laid between 13 and 17 October 2025 and are due to be considered today.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, who is a permanent witness to the committee. I will ask him to address these before opening the floor to members.</p>

          <p eId="para_14">First, we have the National Economic and Social Development Office for 2024. It received a clear audit opinion. Second, we have the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council financial statement for 2024. It also received a clear audit opinion.</p>

          <p eId="para_15">Can we agree to note the listing of accounts and financial statements? Agreed. They will be published as part of our minutes.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> We will now consider category B, items of correspondence that have been received from accounting officers and Government bodies. These items were received between 6 October and 14 October 2025. The committee has agreed to note and publish the following:</p>
          <p eId="para_17"> No. R0289, correspondence from the Office of Public Works, dated 26 September 2025, providing an update on matters raised by the committee on a number of topics;</p>
          <p eId="para_18"> No. R0308, correspondence from the Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine providing an update on the late laying of the financial statements of the Fishery Harbour Centre;</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> No. R0315, correspondence from the Secretary General of the Department of Transport providing an update to the committee’s queries regarding the cost of the Coast Guard search and rescue contract.</p>
          <p eId="para_20"> No. R0316, correspondence from the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Youth in relation to non-compliant procurement;</p>
          <p eId="para_21"> No. R0317, correspondence from Sport Ireland in relation to the refurbishment of tennis courts in Kilmore Quay - the committee has agreed to write to the Department of Culture, Communication and Sport on the matter; and</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> No. R0318, correspondence from An Garda Síochána providing an amendment to the dates referenced in previous correspondence issued to the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> Is it agreed to note and publish that item? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> The committee has scheduled the following meetings for the remainder of 2025. On 6 November, we will meet Uisce Éireann. On 13 November, we will meet the Department of Transport. On 20 November, we will meet the Peter McVerry Trust. On 27 November, we will meet the OPW. On 4 December, we will meet Inland Fisheries Ireland. On 11 December, we will meet the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. On 18 December, we will meet the Department of Social Protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> Are there items the committee wishes to discuss under any other business?</p>

          <p eId="para_26">On the work programme, in regard to the Department of Transport, it is important we notify it that we will raise service delivery issues as well. In my area, phase 7 of BusConnects has just been rolled out in the past week or so. There is huge dissatisfaction about the reduction in bus services and changes to services. It is important the officials are aware of that in advance of coming in.</p>

          <from>Deputy James Geoghegan<recordedTime time="2025-10-23T09:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_27">I mentioned in private session that when Tusla was before the committee as recently as 20 days ago, we discussed its care of unaccompanied minors and missing unaccompanied minors. I asked if there had been any bad outcomes in respect of missing unaccompanied minors. As that stage, just 20 days ago, there had not been. There have clearly been two very serious bad outcomes - you could not even call it that - since then. This committee should probe how well equipped Tusla is to deal with what it itself before this committee described as a challenging service in terms of the numbers and moneys allocated. We will hear from the Department of justice today but the committee should come back to inquiring into Tusla in light of what has transpired in recent weeks.</p>

          <p eId="para_28">I wanted to talk about school transport but I do not think it is under the Department of Transport; I think it is under the Department of education. Will the Department be before the committee at some stage? School transport is horrendous is every year. I would like that to be worked on for next year. Can we invite the Department of education in on school transport? It is an ongoing saga. It is the same story every year. Children cannot get school buses, there are not enough school buses, school buses are not going in the right direction and children not allowed to go to certain schools because they are not so many kilometres from them. We need to have that discussion.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnBrady" eId="spk_7">
          <from> An Cathaoirleach<recordedTime time="2025-10-23T09:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_29">I agree with both of those issues. On Tusla, while I will not address the serious issues, at our previous engagement only a couple of weeks ago there was a lot of concern about the use of unregulated accommodation for unaccompanied minors. I think there was expenditure of €56 million.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_8">
          <from> Mr. Seamus McCarthy<recordedTime time="2025-10-23T09:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_30">It was €66 million, up from €33 million the previous year.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnBrady" eId="spk_9">
          <from> An Cathaoirleach<recordedTime time="2025-10-23T09:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_31">I thank Mr. McCarthy for the clarification. There are a lot of concerns. I note some voices over the past number of days have been calling for an end to the use of unregulated accommodation. Given the seriousness of the issue and everything that has happened over the period between our engagement with Tusla and now, it is an issue we should come back to and have a look at the whole area in terms of the huge expenditure on unregulated accommodation and concerns around Tusla. We will come back to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> On the Department of education and school transport, it is an annual issue. Every year, there is the scramble for tickets, the shortage of bus drivers and the costs involved. We can include that in our work programme next year once we get to the end of our agreed programme.</p>

          <p eId="para_33">This morning, we will engage with the Department of Justice, Home Affairs on Migration to examine the 2024 Appropriation Accounts for Vote 21 - Prisons, Vote 24 - Justice and Vote 40 - Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, programme E expenditure. The committee will also examine Chapter 9 of the Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2022 and Chapters 9 and 10 of the Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2024.</p>
          <p eId="para_34"> We are joined by the following officials from the Department of Justice, Home Affairs and Migration: Ms Oonagh McPhillips, Secretary General and Accounting Officer; Mr. Doncha O'Sullivan, deputy secretary general; Ms Caron McCaffrey, director general, Irish Prison Service; Mr. Richard Browne, director of the National Cyber Security Centre, NCSC; Mr. David Delaney, assistant secretary; Mr. Neil Ward, assistant secretary; and Ms Fidelma Browne, principal officer.</p>
          <p eId="para_35">We are also joined by Mr. Daniel O'Callaghan, principal officer, justice Vote, from the Department of Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation, and officials from the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, namely the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, a permanent witness to the committee, and Ms Jennifer O'Halloran, audit manager. They are all very welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_36"> I wish to explain some limitations to parliamentary privilege and the practice of the Houses as regards references witnesses may make to other persons in their evidence. The evidence of witnesses who are physically present or who give evidence from within the parliamentary precincts is protected, pursuant to both the Constitution and statute, by absolute privilege. This means they have an absolute defence against any defamation action for anything they say at the meeting. However, they are expected not to abuse this privilege, and it is my duty as Cathaoirleach to ensure it is not abused. Therefore, if witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_37"> Witnesses are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity.

          <from> Mr. Seamus McCarthy<recordedTime time="2025-10-23T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_39">The appropriation account for Vote 24 - Justice, records gross expenditure of €661 million in 2024. This was an increase of almost €110 million, or 20%, on the prior year. Expenditure under the Vote was distributed across two programmes, namely a criminal justice pillar, which accounts for €404 million, or around 60% of the expenditure, and a civil justice pillar, which accounts for the remaining 40%, or €257 million. In broad terms, the voted expenditure in 2024 covered the administrative and service costs of the then Department of Justice and of a range of small but important service providers in the justice sector. In some cases, these are semi-autonomous divisions of the Department, such as the Probation Service and the Office of the State Pathologist. Others are statutory bodies with their own independent governance and reporting arrangements, such as the Legal Aid Board and newly established Cuan. Larger agencies in the sector, such as An Garda Síochána and the Courts Service, have their own Votes and Accounting Officers.</p>
          <p eId="para_40"> I issued a clear audit opinion on the appropriation account for Vote 24 but drew attention to disclosures in the statement on internal financial controls in respect of material instances of non-compliance with national procurement rules regarding contracts that operated in 2024.</p>
          <p eId="para_41"> At the start of June 2025, the Department was assigned responsibility for cybersecurity policy and strategy in Ireland. It discharges these functions through the National Cyber Security Centre, NCSC, which previously was part of the Department of Climate, Energy and the Environment. Expenditure on the functioning of the NCSC in 2024 totalled €8.8 million. The NCSC’s remit covers the response to the increasing cyber threats of all strategically important entities in Ireland, whether public or private. In late 2021, the NCSC published cybersecurity baseline standards for the public sector which set out the measures that public bodies should implement to secure their ICT networks. The NCSC subsequently published a self-assessment form in November 2022 that public bodies could use to assess their cybersecurity defences.</p>
          <p eId="para_42"> Chapter 9 of my Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2023 provided an overview of the NCSC’s cybersecurity self-assessment form and shares some user experience of its application. Overall, the report concluded that the checklist is a good model for public sector bodies to use to assess their cybersecurity practices and controls. The Accounting Officer will be able to give the committee an update on the implementation of the report’s recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_43"> The Irish Prison Service is formally part of the Department of justice but is funded and accounted for separately through Vote 21. While the Secretary General of the Department is the Accounting Officer for Vote 21, the Prison Service is headed operationally by its director general.</p>
          <p eId="para_44"> The 2024 appropriation account for Vote 21 - Prisons, records gross expenditure of almost €501 million. A total of 68% of the expenditure, totalling €340 million, relates to pay. The remainder is spread across a range of areas including maintenance and improvements to the prison estate, equipment purchases, education and services for prisoners and other operating costs. There was a small surrender at the year’s end of €1.37 million. I issued a clear audit opinion in respect of the account.</p>
          <p eId="para_45"> Note 6.6 of the appropriation account provides an overview of certain non-Vote accounts operated within the Prison Service, including accounts for prisoners’ personal funds and prison shops. The note includes an update on progress made by the Prison Service in respect of voluntary mess committees, which have been an area of significant attention for the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_46"> In May, the Department of Justice, Home Affairs and Migration assumed responsibility for the provision of accommodation and related services to international protection applicants in need of these supports. The Department already had responsibility for processing applications for protection. The aggregate expenditure under the accommodation programme in 2024, when it was part of Vote 40, was €2.3 billion. Of this, €1.2 billion related to accommodation and other costs for Ukrainian beneficiaries of temporary protection, and €1.1 billion related to accommodation for others seeking international protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_47"><b><i>
							</i></b>Chapter 10 of my Report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2024 reviews the operation of controls over the management of contracts for the provision of accommodation services for persons seeking international protection. This included: the adequacy of due diligence checks before contracts are entered into; and the subsequent management of the contracts, with a focus on ensuring that what is paid for by taxpayers is received.</p>
          <p eId="para_48"> By the end of 2024, close to 33,000 international protection applicants were living in State-supported accommodation, and around three quarters of those applicants were in emergency accommodation. As mentioned earlier, expenditure of almost €1.1 billion was incurred on the provision of accommodation and related services for international protection applicants in 2024. Over 90% of the expenditure comprised payments to commercial providers.</p>
          <p eId="para_49"> The examination’s review of a sample of properties found that pre-contract due diligence records were significantly incomplete. Evidence of planning permission to use the property for international protection accommodation, or confirmation of exempted development, was available for only one in five of the properties examined. Insurance certificates and appropriate fire certificates were available for only around two in five of the properties. Actual signed contracts were available for just half of the sample properties reviewed.</p>
          <p eId="para_50"> The examination also identified gaps in the controls over payments for accommodation. In December 2023, it was established that a provider of multiple properties had been overcharging VAT and had been overpaid a total of €7.4 million. By September 2025, just €1.5 million of this had been refunded. The Department stated recovery of the balance was under review.</p>
          <p eId="para_51"> The ultimate objective of the Department-led project to develop a criminal justice operational hub is to enable the effective end-to-end management of cases and persons through the criminal justice system. My report examines the development of the hub between 2017 and 2024.</p>
          <p eId="para_52"> The 2017 business plan for the hub set a budget of €7.2 million over three years, to be funded from Vote 24 - Justice. Except for 2020, the Department has significantly underspent on the hub’s annual funding allocation.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_8">Most of the expenditure of €4.3 million incurred by the Vote to the end of 2024 relates to consultant or contractor costs. Some additional expenditure was incurred by other Votes, such as the Courts Service and An Garda Síochána.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_9"> While many potential data transfer projects have been identified across the justice sector, just four projects have been completed in the seven years since development of the hub started. A review of two of the completed projects indicates that the benefits set for the projects appear to have been achieved. That only four projects have been completed may indicate a loss of momentum and a loss of potential net economic benefits from the use of improved technology. Planned data harvesting and capacity for the tracking of individuals’ journeys through the criminal justice system have also been suspended from the project. As a result, it is unlikely the hub will enable end-to-end management of cases in the short to medium term. The report makes recommendations about strengthening the planning and management of projects and ensuring post-project reviews address the anticipated benefits set at the project planning stage.</summary>

          <from> Ms Oonagh McPhillips<recordedTime time="2025-10-23T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_54">Before I start, I will take a moment to pay tribute to An Garda Síochána and Garda colleagues on the front line who have been dealing with very dangerous situations in the past couple of nights. They have responded with typical courage and professionalism. I also think of the vulnerable child who is the alleged victim of a crime and her family. That matter is now before the courts so I will not say anything more specific about it. However, the violence we have seen this week, as others have said in the House this week, cannot be viewed as some kind of legitimate reaction to that crime. I send my best wishes to the gardaí who have sustained injuries in the past two nights. I hope they are recovering well. They are not major injuries, but even a minor injury can have a lifelong tail on it sometimes, so I am thinking of them. I also thank our team in Citywest. I am conscious of the impact this has had on all the people living, working, going to school and so on in Citywest. A mix of international protection applicants and Ukrainians reside in the facility. There are up to 400 families with children. I am also thinking of all the residents in the area who have nothing to do with this type of manipulation and violence. We have been engaging with local residents and listening to their concerns in the past few months. They are decent law-abiding people and I realise this has been a difficult week for them as well. I thank the Chair for indulging me with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_55"> I thank the committee for the invitation to discuss the 2024 appropriation accounts for Vote 24 - justice, and Vote 21 - prisons, along with the 2024 expenditure in Vote 40, which has since been transferred to the Department of Justice, Home Affairs and Migration, and three chapters from the Comptroller and Auditor General’s 2022 and 2024 reports on the accounts of the public service. I will share my time with Ms McCaffrey, director general of the Irish Prison Service. I thank the Comptroller and Auditor General and his office for their valuable work in auditing the appropriation accounts and on the reports on the accounts of the public services.</p>
          <p eId="para_56"> In 2024, the justice Vote was one of six in the sector, as the Comptroller and Auditor General said, and supported a broad range of public services delivered by the Department and its agencies. More than 4,000 people worked in the Department and agencies funded from the Vote, serving the Government and the public. Staffing increased from 3,542 people in 2023 to 4,197 people in 2024, reflecting both organisational growth and the scale of the Department’s responsibilities. This growth was particularly directed towards managing our busy immigration services.</p>
          <p eId="para_57"> Working towards our vision of a safe, fair and inclusive Ireland means that diversity and inclusion is centrally important across all levels. Women accounted for 59% of staff in 2024, with a majority at nearly every grade and near equality in the management board, narrowing our gender pay gap to 1.27% in 2024. There was also wider representation of colleagues with disabilities, a growing variety of ethnic backgrounds and from the LGBT+ community. Where comparable data is available, the Department of justice ranks very strongly on all these markers.</p>
          <p eId="para_58"> The Department’s net expenditure in 2024 was €506 million, including €10 million in capital investment. Our largest ever project, the new Forensic Science Ireland laboratory in Backweston, Kildare, was officially opened in 2024. It is a world-class facility providing vital support to the criminal justice system. The Department prioritised important modernisation programmes throughout the year, supported by investment in technology and innovation. Major programmes included improving our cyber resilience, immigration services and international protection processing. The criminal justice operational hub continued to develop provision of a secure digital method for co-operation to replace paper and manual processes across the criminal justice system. The Department is committed to further strengthening project management, reporting and accountability processes, as recommended by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his review of this important programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_59"> Expenditure was managed across two programmes in the Vote, criminal justice and civil justice, which includes immigration. After the transfer of functions completed in May and June of this year, the Department gained responsibility for cybersecurity policy and the National Cyber Security Centre, and the areas of integration and accommodation for international protection applicants and people fleeing the war in Ukraine. The Department advanced major legislative reform during the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_60"> The Policing, Security and Community Safety Act 2024 was a fairly comprehensive transformation of policing and security over the course of the year. The Act established a number of important new bodies but beyond these structural changes, it also provides for community safety as a shared responsibility across the Government and seeks to strengthen co-ordination between policing, health, education, housing and local authorities to address the underlying causes of crime. A director of the new National Office for Community Safety was appointed in September 2024. The office plays a central role in rolling out and supporting the 36 new local community safety partnerships, LCSPs, to be established and is providing support, training and guidance to local authorities to enhance safety in communities across Ireland. It will also administer the community safety fund, which had an allocation of €3.75 million in 2024, rising to €4 million this year and to €4.75 million in 2026, supporting projects to prevent crime and strengthen resilience.</p>
          <p eId="para_61"> The Youth Justice Strategy 2021-2027 also progressed strongly, with funding of €30 million in 2024, rising to €33.2 million this year, supporting youth diversion projects nationwide. We will achieve full national coverage in this important area by the end of this year, again supported by further investment. These initiatives play a vital role in supporting youth workers on the front line to divert young people from crime and support them to address their destructive behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_62"> Tackling domestic, sexual and gender-based violence is a core priority under the whole-of-government zero tolerance strategy. The Department worked with partners to establish Cuan, the new statutory agency leading the national response which was established in January 2024. The agency has a strong board and enthusiastic team and I am very proud of the work they are leading across the Government, co-ordinating refuge provision, victim support, prevention and awareness programmes and providing services.</p>
          <p eId="para_63"> In the 12-month period to April of this year, the Central Statistics Office recorded that almost 125,300 people moved to Ireland. This includes 31,500 returning Irish citizens and 30,200 arrivals from the UK and EU countries. Approximately 50% came from other countries such as India and Brazil to work or study. They make enormously positive contributions to our society and economy and play vital roles in sectors like healthcare, home care, construction, technology, retail, hospitality and transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_64"> During 2024, the Department took over full responsibility for renewing immigration permissions, which had traditionally been a task undertaken by An Garda Síochána in Garda stations around the country. This represented a major milestone in modernising immigration services. It allowed a more streamlined approach while freeing gardaí to concentrate on front-line policing and immigration enforcement measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_65"> Each year, people arrive in Ireland seeking refuge and protection under international law. Those who apply for international protection are entitled to basic needs, such as accommodation, under Irish and EU law. Between 2022 and 2024, 159,000 people arrived in Ireland seeking either temporary or international protection, including 114,000 who fled the war in Ukraine. This placed exceptional demands on the State’s protection and accommodation systems and required a major operational scale-up. While pressures remain, the system delivered much faster decisions in 2024 and handled new applications more effectively. We have stabilised things further in 2025. The International Protection Office, IPO, continued to expand its capacity and improve efficiency. Investment in digitisation, re-engineered processes and additional staffing transformed its operations. Staffing more than tripled from 143 people in 2019 to 620 people in 2024. The IPO delivered over 14,000 first-instance decisions in 2024 compared with 8,500 in 2023 and is on target to decide over 20,000 cases this year. The International Protection Appeals Tribunal, IPAT, closed 3,100 appeals last year, almost double the number in the previous year. These results reflect strong progress following sustained investment, progress that we have continued to build upon this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_66"> I want to specifically address the accommodation services for international protection applicants. The State had to respond to a sudden and intense surge in asylum applications from over 55,000 people in the past four years, which coincided with the arrival of more than 114,000 people from Ukraine, as I already said.</p>
          <p eId="para_67">A massive effort across both the Ukraine and international protection accommodation teams was required and a lot was asked of public services and communities across Ireland. Teams of civil and public servants across a range of Departments and agencies worked really hard during this period to deliver services and increase bed spaces from 7,000 to 27,000, expanding IPAS accommodation capacity, very rapidly, in a very restricted sector. The profound shortages of accommodation persisted throughout that period and from the end of 2023, the State was unable to offer accommodation to all international protection applicants in line with its legal duty. This led to instances of unaccommodated applicants and while most applicants were not rough-sleeping, the numbers waiting for an offer rose to a peak of 3,500 people in March 2025. The crisis period meant that emergency sourcing of a wide range of accommodation options was essential. This is in part why we now have a much larger system than we needed in 2021, but also why it expanded into further commercial provision and parts of the system were not brought on in the ideal configurations, nor at the value for public money we could expect to achieve in more normal times.</p>
          <p eId="para_68"> Since taking responsibility for this service in May of this year, and as application numbers have dropped, the Department has focused on speeding up applications, increasing returns, and reducing the size and costs of the commercial accommodation system, including by developing more State-owned accommodation solutions. We have made good progress, as outlined in the response to the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on these services, introducing an extensive set of new procedures, payment controls and contracting processes. These measures are already delivering improved value for money to the State. As the committee is aware, the Government has prioritised reform of this system, with a focus on reducing costs, making applications quicker and increasing the number of returns when applications are unsuccessful, all the while maintaining fair procedures.</p>
          <p eId="para_69"> The Department maintained strong oversight of our many agencies in 2024 through formal governance and performance agreements that set clear expectations while respecting operational independence. Funding and resource requirements were managed in close collaboration with the Department of public expenditure and I would like to thank my colleagues there. </p>
          <p eId="para_70"> Last year also saw the conclusion of the Stardust inquests and the introduction of a compensation scheme which I hope has brought some degree of solace to the families of the 48 young people who were unlawfully killed in 1981. I thank my colleagues on the inquest team and all those who worked so hard to support the families.</p>
          <p eId="para_71"> I am happy to go into further detail as members require but will hand over now to Ms McCaffrey.</p>

          <p eId="para_72">I thank the committee for the invitation to discuss Vote 21 which had a total net expenditure of €488 million in 2024. As members will be aware, the Irish Prison Service does not have the option of refusing committals and must accept all people committed to us by the courts. In 2024 we witnessed sustained growth in the size of the prison population, with a 9.6% increase in committals and an average prison population of just over 4,900. Numbers have continued to increase and today the system is operating at 120% of capacity, with over 5,500 people in custody. The cost of keeping a person in custody has also increased by almost 12%, with an annual cost of a prison space in 2024 of €99,000. To accommodate these increasing demands, significant investments were made in the prison estate including capital projects to improve security, expand capacity and modernise facilities. The Prison Service was allocated €502 million in gross funding to ensure that key operational functions remained robust, while almost half of the €39.5 million capital budget was strategically utilised to provide additional prison spaces.</p>
          <p eId="para_73"> The Government has made significant capital funding available to the Prison Service in order to enhance our existing prison infrastructure and to provide additional capacity. The revised national development plan capital allocation for the Irish Prison Service will see record capital investment of over €500 million between 2026 and 2030. This funding will achieve over 1,500 spaces between now and 2031. As numbers in custody have grown, so too has the demand for prisoner services. Enhancing rehabilitation and prisoner support remains central to our mission. Education participation rates saw continued engagement, with an average of 58.5% of prisoners participating in educational programmes over the course of the year. Work training initiatives were also expanded during the year with the introduction of nearly zero energy building, NZEB, retrofitting, a critical skill to support employment for prisoners post release and reduce recidivism.</p>
          <p eId="para_74"> In 2024 the Irish Prison Service employed 3,740 full-time employees across a range of disciplines. Despite a competitive job market, the Prison Service recruited 270 prison officers in 2024 and is on target to recruit 300 this year. The digitalisation of services is a key part of our strategic plan and on 1 July 2024, we introduced an online payments system to allow prisoners' families to electronically transfer money into prisoners' accounts. In the final six months of 2024, 80,000 transactions were made to a value of €4.1 million. The success of this project not only reduces our levels of risk with cash handling, which is very significant, but also provides a valuable service for the families of prisoners who no longer have to travel to prison to lodge money to their family member's account. </p>
          <p eId="para_75"> In the face of rising expenditure as a result of a rising prison population, we continue to seek efficiencies and savings. The work of our centralised video link unit reduced the requirement for 9,000 of our staff to attend court physically through working with the Courts Service to leverage the usage of video link technology which was introduced during Covid. These are some of the successes and challenges of the Prison Service during 2024. The Secretary General and I are happy to take any questions members may have.</p>

          <p eId="para_77">I thank the witnesses for coming in today. I want to begin by acknowledging the deeply distressing events that took place in Citywest this week and again last night. My first thoughts are with the young girl at the centre of this matter. I hope that she and her family are receiving all the care and support they need. My heart goes out to them at this very difficult time. I am also thinking of the family of the young Ukrainian man murdered in one of the IPAS centres. I also want to acknowledge the wider community in Citywest who are deeply unsettled and frightened by what occurred. People are genuinely anxious and they deserve reassurance, clarity and very calm leadership. The unrest that followed, the violence, the damage to Garda vehicles and the injuries sustained were completely unacceptable. Gardaí have had an extremely difficult and dangerous job to do over recent days and they deserve our full support and gratitude for their efforts to restore order and protect the public. Those who assault our children must be brought to justice and those who riot on our streets and endanger communities must also be held accountable. Peaceful protest is a cornerstone of our democracy but violence and intimidation have no place in it. </p>
          <p eId="para_78"> Our role today, as members of the Committee of Public Accounts, is to focus on governance, procurement and accountability within the international protection accommodation service. This is about ensuring that public funds are spent transparently, fairly and lawfully and that the systems in place are robust, safe and respectful for everyone involved. It is not about policy or politics today but about ensuring that compassion and accountability go hand in hand, that we protect children, support our communities and uphold the values that define us as a democracy. </p>
          <p eId="para_79"> International protection applicants are protected by Irish law and EU law and those protections cost money. In 2024 the Department of justice spent almost €1 billion on accommodation and related services. A total of €230 million went to just seven providers. How were these providers chosen and did the Department use competitive tendering? What checks are now in place to make sure that prices charged by accommodation providers are fair and reflect value for money for the Irish taxpayer?</p>

          <p eId="para_83">Just to go into some of the questions raised and to back up the point made by the Secretary General, we grew from 7,000 beds to 27,000 in the space of two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_84">That was a very large amount of growth in a short space of time. The Deputy pointed to the EU and Irish legal obligations to accommodate people. The priority was to get beds and make sure that we had accommodation for everyone coming into the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_85"> In terms of competitive processes, we had a procurement process at the end of November 2022 to bring on board a sufficient amount of beds. That process did bring on a few thousand beds but, in the context of the surge we were experiencing at that point in time, that was not sufficient to meet the demand that existed in the system. We then moved to an expression of interest process where anyone who had available accommodation that met our needs at the time, met the planning and building regulation requirements and could accommodate people was accepted. Many of the providers the Deputy mentioned, which are the seven top providers of beds, would have come in through the majority of that process. They would have been assessed at that time, gone through a due diligence process and been identified as being appropriate to provide accommodation to asylum seekers then.</p>
          <p eId="para_86"> In terms of the process being fair and also providing value for money, I can point to the fact that we now have a very robust due diligence process. We require a Company Registration Office number for every company that applies for international protection accommodation. We use a Tailte Éireann mapping service to confirm the property in question. We also insist on tax clearance-----</p>

          <p eId="para_87">Thank you, I am just going to go on. Mr. Delaney said the Department moved from a proper procurement process to an expression of interest process. I do not know what that is, but I know that the C and AG found serious weaknesses when it came to contract management and procurement. Only half of the properties reviewed had all signed contracts, with declared costs and clear cost and capacity details. How can the Department justify making such large payments, where proper contracts were not signed? Can the Department confirm that no new centre will open without a full signed contract, that costs will be set out fully, and that safety and capacity requirements will be in place?</p>

          <p eId="para_88">In terms of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report in respect of the signed contracts, many of those properties had a signed contract as part of the current negotiation process, which is underpinned by a rate card. I can go into that in more detail.</p>

          <p eId="para_101">I can confirm that any property that is either in a contract renewal process right now, or any new property that is being taken on right now, would require all of the planning declarations from the county council, and all fire certification and insurance documents to be provided, before a contract is signed. That has been the case for the last year or so. Going back to that phase in 2022 and into 2023, when so many beds had to be brought on in a short space of time, that documentation might not have been in place, but I can confirm now that no contract would be entered into without that material being present.</p>

It came to light that only 14 of 18 centres inspected in 2024 met the inspection targets and the standards.

          <p eId="para_103">I can confirm that we have done over 300 inspections so far in 2025, 50% of which were by a third party and 50% by civil servants. A report is produced from each of those inspections. Those reports are published on <i>gov.ie</i> so they are transparent and in the public domain. The report is shared with the provider within a fortnight of the inspection and the provider must rectify all issues in the report within 14 days of receiving it. We would reinspect if needed. We would require evidence that all of the issues raised are rectified as part of the feedback from the provider. If the provider continuously fails to rectify as requested, there are clauses in the contracts that allow us to withdraw 10% of the payment requested. If there are ongoing issues, or a serious issue is identified and the provider does not rectify it, we will terminate the contract. So far this year, we have terminated 17 contracts with providers on the basis of non-compliance or non-performance. We take this very seriously. We also have HIQA inspecting about 50 centres a year as well.</p>

          <p eId="para_104">In relation to the Department's 2024 accounts, the C and AG's office discovered overcharging of VAT. The report highlighted that the State was clearly overcharged in the region of €7.4 million. Has the Department now fully recovered that amount? Is that provider still operating under IPAS contracts? If it is, why is it still operating? If the amount is not fully recovered, has the Department initiated legal proceedings to recover the overpayment of VAT?</p>

          <p eId="para_105">That situation relates to one provider. We have looked into it in detail. It relates to a time in the hospitality industry when there was lack of clarity, when moving from Covid-19 to the Ukraine crisis, in terms of the appropriate VAT for emergency accommodation. We had an external expert brought in to check this for us. The advice we received was that the provider in question had acted in a very prudent manner in erring on the side of caution in charging VAT, which is ultimately money that we collected for the State in the circumstance. There were meetings between the Irish Hotels Federation and the Department of Finance, and between the Department of Finance and the European Commission, to clarify this, in a general sense, for the federation. When the clarity was ultimately sought, the provider approached Revenue to do a self-correction. That self-correction was worked through between the provider and the Revenue Commissioners because, ultimately, VAT is between the provider and the Revenue Commissioners. The final settlement was that the Department was owed the money that was paid back with the remainder-----</p>

          <p eId="para_326">I thank Ms McPhillips and all the other witnesses. A bit like the previous questioner, the range of issues I could raise with them reflects the range of responsibilities they have. Also, given all the statements that have been made by everybody else, and I would agree with them, this is an incredibly sensitive time. Equally, however, our role is to ensure that there is good value for the public money that is raised. The scale of the spending we are talking about here, particularly in relation to international protection, is of such an order - for example, the entire tax package available in the budget was €1.5 billion - that when we are talking about an accommodation system that is costing in that order, it just shows the scale of spending. As well as the justice committee, there is a big job for this committee to do in monitoring what is happening within the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_327"> To help me get to the bottom of some figures, for 2024 I have seen a figure of 33,000 in international protection and a figure of €1.1 billion and a separate figure of €3 billion for the cost of accommodation. Could the witnesses help us get to the facts of some of those figures? How many were in international protection for that period and what were the accommodation costs?</p>

          <p eId="para_340">Yes, no problem. The figure of €71 per person per night is the average contracted rate for each bed, whereas the cost across the system would include many more things like funding local authority integration teams, paying for taxis and buses and loads of other different services around the system. We are looking at a very big gap for that reason. In fairness to the Deputy, it was a very specific question about what the contracted rate is.</p>

          <p eId="para_341">Of course, so there is a broader cost than just accommodation. The reason I ask that question is that I was reading the OECD report with regard to the Development Assistance Committee, that is, the DAC-able element, and it has a cost per refugee for different OECD countries. The UK was the highest at $26,400, but Ireland was second at $19,400. Have we looked at other countries and the cost of refugee protection in Ireland as opposed to there? It would appear, in the context of that report - and I accept I am throwing at a report at the witnesses, poorly referenced - that we are a complete outlier in terms of the cost per refugee that we are reporting.</p>

          <p eId="para_342">I am happy to take that. Unfortunately, I have also read the report so I am aware of it. It is an interesting read and it has informed decision-making. Probably one difference in Ireland compared to other OECD countries is that the surge impacted not just IPAS but the whole international protection system. While brilliant work is being done in the International Protection Office and the International Protection Appeals Tribunal, processing times have increased, which means people are staying in the accommodation for longer. That would be out of the norm compared to other OECD countries. As well as that, because of the excellent work done by colleagues on the processing side, an awful lot of people have got permissions, and rightly so, but because of the challenges of getting accommodation in Ireland, be it HAP-----</p>

          <p eId="para_345">However, on top of that, as we have seen in the comprehensive accommodation strategy, owning the centres and using State-owned sites to build on, or using State accommodation, as well as the other factor where other OECD countries are further along the curve and they would have that infrastructure and then their costs-----</p>

          <p eId="para_346">Let me reference some of those countries. In France and Sweden the figure is approximately $6,500. It is possible that an entirely different package is being offered in Poland, but the figure there is coming in at $1,500 per refugee. It is very difficult to understand the discrepancy in the cost per refugee being reported. Mr. Delaney has referenced the report. People want to know whether we are providing a higher level or a more expensive version. Is the taxpayer in Ireland getting poorer value for money in what is being provided, compared with other OECD countries?</p>

          <p eId="para_347">There are definitely differences in how the calculations are done. I looked at the Polish example as well. That factors in that an awful lot of people are not necessarily accommodated in the Polish system, or some are in detention facilities that are not necessarily considered reception and accommodation centres by the OECD or the EU asylum agency. That can change the figures considerably. That is a big factor. Comparators are a variable here, but the three variables I outlined-----</p>

          <p eId="para_349">It absolutely will. We can see the per-person-per night rate in State centres is far lower than the commercial rate. The value already exists there. We can see ourselves getting more value as that State-centred model grows. We have gone from around 900 available State beds approximately two years ago to nearly 4,000 State beds now. We see that as a key in getting more value for money for the taxpayer. </p>

The figure I was taken aback by related to those in special emergency arrangements. I appreciate that not all of those people are seeking international protection. However, for those in special emergency arrangements, a figure of €750,000 per year was given as being the cost of providing support for an unaccompanied minor, and that had come down from €900,000 per year. It was also acknowledged that there has been a huge influx of those people, reporting to be under 18 years of age, seeking international protection. I think it was a figure of over 500 was presented. As other members have said, in the last number of weeks we have had two very significant incidents. I want to stick with the issue of special emergency arrangements for people seeking international protection. Of those 500 people presenting, how many are in special emergency arrangements? That was funded by the Department of children. Has that responsibility transferred over to the Department of justice? </p>

That is happening in the course of this year and we expect it to happen more during next year as well. That is where that comes from. There is roughly €700 million provided for Ukraine in this year and that is €170 million less next year. </p>

We have a new scheme at the moment where we are increasing the amount of funding to try to encourage people to take up that option because it is much cheaper and easier for everyone if they do so. If people do not take that option, in most cases a deportation order will be made for them and in most cases people comply with that order and leave.</p>

          <p eId="para_426">Our community support scheme is for people who serve sentences up to 18 months. The primary consideration is public safety. That is the factor that is taken into account. There is no specific maximum sentence a person needs to serve, but we would be looking at people who present a low risk to public safety and who are in for lower types of offences. For community return, that applies to people serving 18 months up to eight years. For people serving between two and five years, they can be released after half of their remitted sentence.</p>

          <p eId="para_448">Okay. In relation to the importation of firearm component parts for privately owned firearms, my party colleague Deputy Alan Kelly has raised this through parliamentary questions on a number of occasions since the Thirty-fourth Dáil began. The Department would be well aware of privately owned firearms, not official Garda firearms, being imported into the State by An Garda Síochána's firearms store section.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">The unique aspect to this particular squandering of Exchequer funding is that it was conducted by way of fraudulent deception of the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_450"> In response to a parliamentary question from Deputy Kelly, it was said Department officials were deceived by portraying items imported as part of official Garda firearms, when in fact the parts were shown to be service and repair firearms belonging to a hunt and pony club. Former Commissioner Drew Harris was aware of this long before he was replaced by new Commissioner Justin Kelly. He chose not to take any action against those involved. As per parliamentary question replies from the Department, he deliberately neglected to inform the Minister for justice and the Department. Is that correct?</p>

          <p eId="para_497">I thank all the witnesses for attending. Like many of the other speakers, I want to express at the outset my sorrow for the young girl who has been the subject of an alleged sexual assault, and to the Ukrainian who has lost his life. It is important to emphasise that both of these children, one of whom is dead and the other who is alleged to have been sexually assaulted, were in the care of the State. There is no avoiding or evading that responsibility. The efforts, essentially, of people to gather outside Citywest in my view is an effort to dehumanise those acts. It is to perpetuate the othering. We should constantly remember the victims at the coalface of all this, while at the same time hold to account in the Committee of Public Accounts the State's obligation to these human beings and what they have suffered. It is really important to emphasise that because no efforts to dehumanise what took place should get any truck from any politician, and we should stand four square behind our gardaí in the efforts they are making to keep communities safe.</p>
          <p eId="para_498"> I am going to continue the line of questioning in relation to the IPAS system. In the previous Government, a decision was taken to separate the accommodation of international applicants from the decision-making in respect of international applicants. Did that cause a dysfunction in the system as it relates to international applicants?</p>

          <p eId="para_499">I do not think so. It is better now, and the joined-up aspect of the system certainly makes sense to us. However, that was the decision taken, and we made the best of it. We worked very closely, and continue to work very closely, with our colleagues who transferred to the Department of children. I would make the point that, in 2020, roughly 50 or 60 people went to the Department of children, with about €120 million of a budget, and it was considerably larger when it returned to us. The team did an amazing job over the last few years. Certainly, from now going forward and into the pact arrangements, it is definitely useful to have it all together.</p>

          <p eId="para_506">Okay. Obviously, the situation in respect of that poor girl who was allegedly sexually assaulted is that she was an unaccompanied minor. Two weeks ago, representatives from Tusla appeared before the committee and we were dealing with the subject of unaccompanied minors in the IPAS system. I put the question to them in respect of unaccompanied minors and missing children, of which there were several, and they put it in terms of days how long they were missing. I asked whether there had been any bad outcomes and the reply given at that stage was that there had not been. Obviously, since then, in less than 20 days, there have been these two horrific tragedies. One of the things that Tusla did identify is that it is Tusla's responsibility, or it is left with the responsibility, to age verify the unaccompanied minors it is looking after in a kind of colloquial way because it is relying on the Department or An Garda Síochána or whosever responsibility it is to carry out that process, but it is actually not being carried out in a timely fashion. Does Ms McPhillips accept that criticism or that contention?</p>

I do not want to comment on a case, but I do not think the little girl who has been mentioned several times here this morning is within the international protection, IP, system at all. It is just to clarify that.</p>
          <p eId="para_508"> The other issue is in relation to the verification of age. That process is one for Tusla. What happens is that people come into the International Protection Office, IPO, to our staff. We have staff seconded from Tusla in the IPO or certainly we make arrangements to identify-----</p>

          <p eId="para_509">Just on the age verification, the Tusla representatives were quite critical in respect of being left with the responsibility, essentially, to sort of look at the child or person before them and guess basically whether he or she is a minor or not a minor. They were quite critical that the function, which rests with the Department, as best as I understand it, was not being carried out in a timely way. Does Ms McPhillips accept that criticism?</p>

We have two NGOs that work with people who have a permission in centres to help them exit, integrate into the local communities, find accommodation and move on.

          <p eId="para_544">Although I do not want to misquote him, I think Mr. Delaney said something extraordinary when he was being asked by Deputy Neville about the beneficial ownership of companies that the Department is contracting with, and how the Department knows there is no criminality involved. Mr. Delaney pointed him to the Companies Registration Office. He is hardly suggesting that a company having been registered with the Companies Registration Office is sufficient to satisfy the Department that a company, or people involved in a company, are not engaged in criminality. I presume additional due diligence is carried out when the Department is contracting with an entity responsible for providing accommodation services within the IPAS system.</p>

          <p eId="para_547">I can confirm that exactly. It depends on the construction of the company. In some companies, it is very black and white: there is one owner, so we can do that very simply. However, as the Deputy can imagine, there are very large companies - I do not mean in our world but more broadly - that could have thousands, if not tens of thousands, of shareholders. It does not mean the company has a problem. That has to be a factor as well.</p>

          <p eId="para_559">That is correct. This has to be seen through the lens that from early 2022 to the end of 2023, we went from 7,000 beds to 27,000 beds. As the Secretary General outlined, especially with the Ukraine numbers that were coming in, it was a time when a massive priority was put on getting beds as quickly as humanly possible. The civil servants and communities involved in that deserve credit for the work that was done. Now, we are in a phase of getting control of the system.</p>

          <p eId="para_566">No. We would have a very strict inspection regime. I mentioned previously that we have done over 300 inspections so far in 2025. We also have the HIQA inspection regime, which inspected over 50 centres in 2024 and should do the same again in 2025. That regime includes any information that is brought to light or brought to us. If contractors do not meet the standard required, they are given time to rectify that, and if they do not rectify it quickly enough, we dock their payment by 10%. If they do not rectify it after that, we will then move to terminating. We have terminated 17 contracts so far this year, proving we have a strict system in place. We will maintain that.</p>

It is good to have the budgetary commitment. It definitely gives us a direction of travel and allows us to negotiate on a certain number of contracts knowing that we have the capital.</p>

In lots and lots of cases it would form a view that the person is an adult and return them to us. They are then accommodated in IPAS accommodation.

There are so many people who come into our country and contribute immensely, whether in our hospitals, in our tech companies, right across our society, and in our nursing homes. People make massive contributions. They come into this country via a structured system, whether it is the work permit system or a visa system, and they contribute immensely. This country would be lost without them. Many of them are in my constituency and I am friends with them. I know the value of the work they do. However, without doubt, over the past few years the Irish people have lost their confidence in the State's ability to handle our asylum processing system. Why did the numbers of asylum seekers in Ireland rise from approximately 3,000 per year in 2021 and 2022 to more than 12,000 to 15,000 in the following years?</p>

          <p eId="para_653">To come back to what we discussed a little bit earlier, our preference would be for people to leave voluntarily. As I have said, we are on our way towards 1,600 people leaving voluntarily this year. Where they do not, we make a deportation order. Our assessment is that in most cases people move when they get that order. In many cases they have moved before that because they know their case is heading in that direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">We then, in a smaller proportion of cases, take people into custody and remove them, either on commercial flights or on charter flights. As we process more cases, we are investing more resources in scaling this up.</p>

          <p eId="para_657">Okay, that is perfect. I really do appreciate that because we have had great success with many Departments in getting them to publish those figures. I am really hopeful to see that from the Department soon because the Department of children has been doing it to date, so we were able to garner a lot of information. The most frightening piece of information we gathered was that, over the last decade, the top 25 suppliers of accommodation to the Department of children and now to the Department of justice across 4,248 records, accounted for €2.073 billion worth of purchase orders and payments. The Department has to have serious negotiation power with them, so when these contracts come up for renegotiation the downward price pressure the Department should be able to apply to the contracts should be immense. We should see a drastic saving on these accommodation spots in the future, because we cannot see private interests continue to profit from a State crisis. The State needs to be able to respond. The Citywest purchase was the right thing to do because it shows that the State is going to tackle this issue in the long run and the speed at which applicants are being processed is accelerating. The fact that there are 80% refusals shows there is an issue.</p>

They relaxed the rules, €15 million went to a company, and now €7 million of that is not recoverable and it is all a disaster. We have the Department of justice in here today - I know it was the responsibility of the Department of children before - and billions of euro has been paid out on accommodation to manage a crisis. The attitude seems to be that it was a crisis so it can be justified. I have crises in my constituency, such as children who cannot get SNAs or other supports. Those are crises and we are not able to take out the cheque book, so I just have a huge issue with that.</p>

          <p eId="para_676">I have one last question. I believe, in the last few months, there been a marked change in the Department. Since the responsibility for this has gone to the Department of justice, I believe there has been a policy shift. What I am seeing on the ground is that not as many of these contracts are being given out and compliance is becoming rigorous. Things are improving and that reflects the State's ramping-up of its response. Is it true that people are suing the Minister for justice for not giving them IPAS contracts?</p>

          <p eId="para_681">I want to comment on some of the serious failings of the State that a number of members have alluded to. First, I pass on my condolences to the family of the young Ukrainian man who was brutally murdered while in State care in what could be perceived as, and we mentioned this previously in our engagement with Tusla, a questionable usage of unregulated accommodation. There was a gross failure there and it is something the committee intends to follow up on with Tusla and to express serious concerns. My thoughts go to the family and the ten-year-old child who was allegedly brutally sexually assaulted. My thoughts are with the child and the child's family. Again, this was a serious failure of the State on so many different levels. While I understand the huge level of concern among members of the public about these serious failings, I do not think there is any justification for anyone violently engaging to express those concerns they have or attacking members of An Garda Síochána. There are other ways for members of the public to express their concerns and fears and people should be going down those routes. However, here has been a serious failure of the State in regard to these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_682"> I commend the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General for a considerable piece of work in the chapter on IPAS expenditure. I believe that the work went on for nearly a year so I commend the team on that work. Certainly, the chapter is damning and has put a spotlight on huge expenditure with a real lack of due diligence and payment controls. It feeds into a perception of many members of the public that money was being poured into an area without the proper oversight or governance, so we are here today to discuss that.</p>
          <p eId="para_683"> I have read through the witnesses' opening statements and I have heard them here again today. Do you think the C and AG's report is damning?</p>

          <p eId="para_685">The issue of migration is a challenge, not just here in Ireland but globally, due to measures outside of our control. Whether it is global warming, war or famine, all of these are leading to an increase in immigration.

          <p eId="para_686">I think we have made great strides in recent years. We have certainly put a lot of resources into all aspects of the system, particularly, as I said in my opening statement, the IPO first, but also IPAT. We have put a lot of resources into what we call our repatriation unit, which deals with deportations and voluntary returns. All of this is now, I think, yielding results.</p>

I think there have been serious failures there and, again, I will touch on some of those issues around deportation.</p>

          <p eId="para_698">Ultimately, the provider or contractor charges us VAT, where appropriate, as part of the bill. The relationship is between the contractor and the Revenue Commissioners to settle that VAT portion. We do not charge VAT further on down the scheme, as the Chair can imagine. We have a check in our process now whereby when a payment is being authorised, that confirms whether it appears that the VAT rate-----</p>

          <p eId="para_700">We have not identified anything historically. There have been examples in the past where there might have been overpayments. We have rectified those and got rebates back from the providers in question. That is an ongoing thing. When you have 320-odd providers and a system that is paying out a significant amount of money, you are always going to have a recoupment mechanism in place.</p>

          <p eId="para_702"> The C and AG's chapter 10.60 states that a property that had contracted capacity was identified. It included three rooms that were not being used to accommodate IP applicants based on the single-occupancy daily rate of €169 for that property. I suppose it worked out that IPAS was being overcharged by at least €15,000 a month, which is €180,000 a year. There was a piece of work done by the Department that elaborated on that.</p>

What we do not attempt to put a figure on, for the reason we discussed earlier, is the people who have left without telling us where they were going or what they were doing. We check whether they are on our system and whether they are getting a daily expenses allowance. If the Garda comes across them, they can be arrested and removed. That does not happen very often.

          <p eId="para_933">My understanding is that, in practice, Tusla makes an assessment as to whether the person should receive childcare services. In so doing, it effectively is making a determination as to whether that person is in fact a child. There are cases where someone comes to us claiming that they are a child. We bring that person to Tusla and Tusla subsequently comes back to us and says it does not think the person is entitled to child services because it thinks he or she is an adult. We admit that person then to the process. The delay I was referring to earlier is because this is often disputed between the applicant, perhaps with their lawyer, and ourselves and Tusla, meaning that these cases need to be examined further.</p>

          <p eId="para_939">There is some clarity required around it. In practice, the age assessment has been done by Tusla for many years de facto because it decides whether to admit someone to the process. We obviously engage, the lawyers make representations to us saying this person is actually a child and these cases get examined between us. The expectation is that the new legislation will fix it clearly and put a process around how that happens, with a multidisciplinary team.</p>

As things currently stand, where information comes to light of a documentary nature, such as getting a fingerprint hit from another country where someone applied as a 20-year-old, that is clearly fed into the process. Clearly, that will have a massive bearing on the determination of that person’s case. The idea in the pact is that there will be enhanced screening when people arrive to decide whether people are vulnerable, have special needs or can go through accelerated procedures. That part of the process will happen as a person arrives, rather than a few weeks later or when the case is arrived at. As we are running the front end of that process, it makes sense that we lead on that in a clearer way than is currently the case.</p>

It does not feel like it has the necessary capacity to carry out the age assessments that it is currently carrying out. Is that something that is on the Department’s radar?</p>

          <p eId="para_972">Please do so. I am concerned, and I think there is a general consensus in the room on this, about children potentially residing in an adult setting and, potentially, adults residing in a child setting. Ms McPhillips is rightly saying that this is one of the biggest priorities for the Department, but it is all Tusla's responsibility. For 2022, 2023 and 2024, how many examples or issues have been identified where a child has spent time residing in an adult setting or <i>vice versa</i>?</p>

          <p eId="para_973">I do not think that scenario is as likely as the other scenario, if the Deputy follows. As I said earlier, my understanding from Tusla is that, if it had a doubt, it would give the benefit of the doubt and assume that the young person was a child. That child would not be referred back to us unless Tusla was fairly certain the person was an adult. The child would not find their way into an adult setting. The adult or the borderline adult finding their way into a child setting is the scenario we were just discussing. That is the assessment that has to be done.</p>

          <p eId="para_977">It is an assessment that is done on an ongoing basis, which Tusla brings a lot of expertise to. The accommodation is Tusla's accommodation. Where a person is assessed as an adult and comes back into our accommodation, they are put into an IPAS centre and accommodated. They are offered accommodation in an IPAS centre.</p>

          <p eId="para_980">I would say it is and I will definitely check it. I will provide some reassurance about the issue the Deputy is raising. Tusla's working assumption - it is the right thing to do - is to assume if it is a borderline case that the person is a child. People are put into a child setting so that they are not put into an adult setting. It is the reverse that is the issue, that an adult might be accommodated in a child setting and I will check that number for the Deputy.</p>

          <p eId="para_983">There have been two reviews of the direct provision system in the past ten years. One was done around 2014 and the other, which the Deputy referred to, was done in 2021 or 2022. They both focused a lot on speeding up the system. Some elements are <i>sui generis</i> to that period which made assumptions around the numbers and so forth, but the fundamental element of both reviews and of our policy direction is speeding up the processing system so that people do not spend a long time in the accommodation. They get a decision, whatever it is, quickly and can move on with their lives or have to depart if that is the decision that is made. There is a lot in the review that supports that policy direction still. Our approach in the past few years has been to put resources into processing to make sure people get out of the accommodation as fast as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_984">I will finish with Ms McCaffrey. I thank her for being here. I had the privilege of being played off the park in Mountjoy Prison a few months ago by a team of footballers who handed it to us. They were exceptional and it was a real privilege to meet and speak to them. I was astounded by the commitment of the staff we met on site and the testimony many of the lads were able to share about their time in Mountjoy Prison. However, I was struck by the settings in which some of the men were living.</p>
          <p eId="para_985"> Let us finish on a hypothetical. If Ms McCaffrey, instead of the Minister for justice, had the cheque book to make everyone's experience in a setting like Mountjoy Prison the most supported and conducive to learning, rehabilitation and preparing for their next step in life, what major change would she ask the committee to look for to solidify that experience?</p>

          <p eId="para_986">More than 70% of people who come into custody every year come for fewer than 12 months. People who are in prison for a short sentence do not have the opportunity or time to deal with addiction properly and it is addiction that is fuelling a lot of the offending in the background. They do not have time to get an educational qualification that will help them to go on to further study in the community. We do not have time to give them a skill so they can get employment when they leave.</p>
          <p eId="para_987"> For people serving longer sentences, there are incredible resources and incredible staff. I thank the Deputy for paying tribute to the staff and service providers in our prisons. For people serving shorter sentences there are co-morbidities of mental health and addiction issues. A lot of work is happening on the reform side, particularly in the Probation Service, to put supports in the community instead of having people come to prison for a short period, where we are not in a position to reduce the risk factors giving rise to their offending. There are plans to amend the number of community service hours that can be given, which is an alternative to a custodial sanction a judge can use. The more people in the system, the more challenging it is to provide services.</p>
          <p eId="para_988"> Specifically on what we could do better, if we could get more support in the community for the people who engage in low-level offending because of addiction, mental health issues or low levels of educational attainment, it would be a significant change.</p>

We probably spent similar amounts in 2022 and 2023 when we were ramping up, but the sense I get - we were talking about what happened with Tusla - is that no one is happy with how things have gone in the past few years. I get the sense the Department was at sea in 2022, 2023 and 2024. The proper controls and processes were not in place. We are trying to rectify that now, but a significant amount of money was paid in those times to a lot of individuals who have made themselves rich off the back of the State. That is ultimately the case here. We are not sure what web of companies is behind some of them. Some of them we tried to figure out. We cannot be sure whether there is even a small number of people with criminal links. That was stated by Ms McPhillips in response to a question. We cannot be sure. That is a serious situation for the State to be in. There was probably no other time when the State was or needed to be in that situation. I asked whether we tried to push back at any point on where people might be coming from. We did not.</p>

          <p eId="para_1059">In my constituency last year, there was a site in Newtownmountkennedy where a serious failure occurred. This is probably replicated across the State. There was a failure to properly engage with communities and inappropriate locations were chosen in which to put accommodation. There were a lot of concerns in that instance. I will try to get some of the figures now, but a considerable amount of work was done on that site to prepare it. It was only used for a very short time. Maybe Mr. Delaney can provide an update. I do not think it is being used now. What is the selection process for sites? There is the failure to engage with communities and public representatives. There is also the appropriateness of sites like Newtownmountkennedy, which is in a very rural area. There are the additional pressures they put on communities and the failure to appropriately engage with the communities and other service providers. Maybe Mr. Delaney does not have the information now. That site was formerly a disused HSE site. How much did it cost to prepare it? What is its current status? How long was it utilised for? It is my understanding that it is not being used. What is the long-term plan for that site in Trudder House, Newtownmountkennedy?</p>

          <p eId="para_1060">I will give a bit of background. Ironically, that links to the Cathaoirleach's question about people waiting an offer of accommodation. March and April last year were when the crisis worsened there. We had asylum seekers sleeping in tents on the street and in parks in the city. We had to act exceptionally fast to come up with solutions to offer accommodation to those who required it. We made a call out to the wider system for offers of sites and potential buildings that could be used as a solution, so State sites and, if possible, State buildings-----</p>

I know there were pressures involved, but does he think there was a failure in the critical engagement with communities in the context of the locations chosen? They were chosen not because they were the best sites or locations or because they had the best services, like access to schools or GPs, it was a case of "We have this site. Here you go."</p>

          <p eId="para_1074">No, that is not necessary. On the appropriateness of the sites, I will use the example in Newtown Mount Kennedy, which is a rural site. That is replicated right across the State. Earlier the witnesses referred to other costs. Obviously there were the accommodation fees but there were also other costs. There was reference made to the cost for taxis. In rural settings, there would be a necessity to provide taxis. What other costs would be associated with this, other than the likes of taxis? </p>

          <p eId="para_1083">It would be useful if we could get a breakdown year-on-year. Another point I wish to touch on was referenced earlier and relates to the 4.65 sq. m for people who are being provided accommodation. That goes back to the 2019 guidelines. The experience I have in my constituency is that emergency accommodation was being provided in a hotel. I had a lot of back and forth with the Department on this specific case where bunk beds were jammed into what was a ballroom. This was quite recent. It was certainly after the 2019 guidelines. How does a situation like that arise? That particular accommodation was being utilised to provide emergency accommodation and then overnight a decision was taken to double the capacity in the hotel by putting in more bunk beds. How does that a situation like that arise, given that these guidelines are in place from 2019? </p>

          <p eId="para_1084">Ultimately, it goes back to the crisis that the Secretary General and I outlined. It went from 7,000 beds to 27,000 beds in a short space of time, less than two years. Although we ask and work with providers to get to the national standards, even in some emergency accommodation if it a choice between not being able to provide beds for everybody or emergency accommodation, it may have a lower space ratio than we would like, or bunk beds. We have been clear that emergency accommodation does not always meet national standards. Where it can, we work with providers to try to meet that standard.</p>

To go back to the core point I made earlier in respect of having a fair, efficient and enforced immigration system, this is not on the witnesses but there were failures at different levels which have added to the pressures that we have been experiencing. There have been different initiatives taken that have increased a draw factor to Ireland.

          <p eId="para_1103">Ms McPhillips is satisfied but I remain to be satisfied. There have been serious failures there. I heard that some changes have been made. Some of those changes are only coming about because of the work that is and has been carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor General's office in terms of the comprehensive piece of work it has done over the past year. That has probably affected some of the changes we are seeing now. Those changes may not necessarily have come about without that piece of work. I commend the work of the C and AG for putting a serious spotlight on this issue. While there were 20 sample cases selected by the C and AG's office, I am still not convinced that is it. There are a lot more issues there given the number of contracts and the failure to have the proper due diligence in place. There is potentially a lot more there that we still need to get the answers on. </p>
          <p eId="para_1104"> I thank the witnesses for their engagement. It is going to be an ongoing process because there will be supplementary questions from members. This concludes our engagement with the Department of Justice, Home Affairs and Migration. I thank the Secretary General and her officials for attending. I also thank the officials from the Department of public expenditure and the C and AG's office for their attendance once again. Is it agreed that the clerk will seek any follow-up information and carry out any actions agreed arising from the meeting? Agreed. The committee is now adjourned until Thursday, 6 November 2025 at 9.30 a.m. when the committee will engage with Uisce Éireann.</p>

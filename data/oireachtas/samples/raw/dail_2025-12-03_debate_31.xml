          <p eId="para_10">Apologies have been received from Deputies Michael Murphy and Cathal Crowe.</p>
          <p eId="para_11"> The purpose of our meeting this morning is to consider the Supplementary Estimates for the Public Services, Vote 31, Transport. I remind members that the committee has no role in approving the Estimates. It is an ongoing opportunity for the committee to examine departmental expenditure to make the process more transparent and to engage in a meaningful way on relevant performance issues. I thank the Department for providing the briefing note. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Jerry Buttimer, and his officials to the meeting today.</p>
          <p eId="para_12"> Before I go further, I will read out the note on privilege. Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of that person or entity. Therefore, if their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative they comply with any such direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_13"> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I remind members of the constitutional requirement that they must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex in order to participate in public meetings. I will not permit a member to participate where they are not adhering to this constitutional requirement. Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting. In this regard, I ask members partaking via Microsoft Teams that prior to making their contribution to the meeting, they confirm they are on the grounds of the Leinster House campus.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> I now call on the Minister of State, Deputy Buttimer, to make his opening statement.</p>

          <p eId="para_15">I dtús báire, is cúis mhór áthais dom a bheith i láthair inniu. I am pleased to have the opportunity to appear before an roghchoiste to discuss the 2025 Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Transport. The Supplementary Estimate is in two parts, a substantive Estimate, voting additional funds to the Department, as well as a technical Estimate. In total, €208.9 million in additional current expenditure funds will be allocated to the Vote.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> Taking the substantive supplementary for current expenditure first, €208.9 million will be allocated to public transport services. A total of €211.283 million is needed to address a shortfall in land transport services. However, due to savings of €2.383 million across our non-pay expenditure, this has reduced our substantive supplementary ask to €208.9 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_17"> I am pleased to see passenger numbers performing so well and expect continued growth in passenger numbers through the remainder of 2025. The Department sets the overall policy direction and funding framework for the delivery of public transport services nationwide.</p>
          <p eId="para_18"> This supplementary allocation reflects the Government’s commitment to ensuring that public transport services can continue to operate reliably and sustainably in the face of growing passenger demand and increased operational costs. It will also allow for the continued delivery of targeted fare initiatives, including the recently introduced free travel for all children up to the age of nine and the young adult card for those aged between 19 to 25, as part of the NTA’s national fares strategy and funding to ensure the continued delivery of vital transport services across rural areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> These measures help to ensure that public transport remains accessible and affordable for families, students and young workers across the country. The Department and the NTA continue to review service needs and deployment to support this growth. My Department will continue to maintain robust oversight and performance monitoring of this additional investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_20"> Turning to the technical supplementary, the Department will receive additional supplementary development contributions held by TII with respect to public transport projects. This funding will allow the Vote to utilise appropriations-in-aid in addition to savings to fund projected expenditure on subhead B4, public transport investment, and specifically MetroLink.</p>
          <p eId="para_21"> The Railway Procurement Agency, now TII, received Exchequer advances to fund Luas extensions to Cherrywood and the Docklands. TII is now remitting the related supplementary development contribution scheme income which it did not require to fund the projects over their respective periods of construction to the funding authority, namely, the Department of Transport. I propose to allocate this amount to the National Transport Authority for MetroLink-related costs. Today’s Supplementary Estimate will facilitate this arrangement.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> It is also proposed to allocate €18,883 million from subhead E3.3, IRCG SAR helicopters non-pay, to offset cost pressures across the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> I thank members for their time here today. I commend the Supplementary Estimates to the committee. I am happy to address any questions that members may have.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelCollins2016" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Deputy Michael Collins<recordedTime time="2025-12-03T09:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_24">I thank the Minister of State for appearing before the committee today. In fairness, public transport has come a long way particularly over the past five years. To be honest, it was shocking and dismal prior to that. We have to look at where we are and it is a success. I wonder if we are using our budget correctly. That needs to be looked into. I see some great new services including in my own area in west Cork. There is no point in denying that. We have four new services coming out of Mizen Head that were never there before, which is incredible. The same is true of the Beara Peninsula and the Sheep's Head Peninsula.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> However, there are areas where we could deliver further and which might actually be done under the current budget at the present time. I refer to areas like Caheragh and Drinagh that have no service passing their door any day of the week but rural transport is passing them within maybe five minutes at the same time in other areas. While I do not think we are going to make any savings as such, we should certainly look at public transport in areas like that, which are completely omitted from having any public transport service passing their door. Most places in Ireland would expect to get some kind of bus service and they are continually saying to me that is not happening in their communities. We need to look at having a budget for public transport in areas that do not have a connection to rail and probably will never have rail.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">Many rural communities in the area where I live are 140 km away from rail. That is an astonishing situation. There is not even a budget for a sign showing where the nearest railway station is, which is Cork city. For myself, I come straight to Dublin by car. There is no point in driving two hours and then hopping on a train. There is a point in keeping going while you are at it.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> There is no point in me coming in here saying to the Minister of State that there should be a budget to bring light rail to west Cork. I do not think that will ever happen. Even though it came to Schull at one time, incredibly, it is not going to happen going forward. However, there should be a public transport bus connection to rail every morning. Everyone in this country should have a God-given right. I should not have to come in here, meaning no disrespect to others, to talk about improving rail or improving the amount of time rail costs the communities when we do not even know what it means. Is there to be such a budget? I have brought up here on numerous occasions the need to connect communities that will never have a train but certainly could have a bus-to-train transport service. That is where we need to focus here. There is no point in me spending my time talking about bringing rail to communities when it is never going to happen. Has the Minister of State a budget in place for that to happen out of this Supplementary Estimate?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JerryButtimer" eId="spk_4" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Transport">
          <from>Deputy Jerry Buttimer<recordedTime time="2025-12-03T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_28">I thank Deputy Collins. The Deputy is right. We have seen many parts of Cork county now connected. I have met with representatives in the Caheragh-Drinagh area who are concerned at the lack of a bus service and we are looking at that.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> I suppose there are two parts to the Deputy's question. First, as the Minister of State with responsibility for rural transport, I am ambitious and want to see connectivity enhanced. We have the public service obligation, PSO, which is the overarching funding. We have a well developed plan, Connecting Ireland. It requires ongoing resourcing, both human and financial. If you take it in the context, as the Deputy said, of from where we have come, we have seen an increase in passenger numbers and connectivity. I should pay tribute to the former Minister, Eamon Ryan, for his vision in terms of driving the whole piece around rural transport. We have made significant progress. We are very much driven by the need to have people connected. We cannot get everybody from a bus to a train but the ambition is there. We have seen in Cork, as the Deputy sees from Mallow and An Gleanntán to Midleton, an enhancement of the services.</p>
          <p eId="para_30"> We will not have an historical debate about the west Cork railway line. The Deputy and I would probably agree on that. In hindsight, maybe that should never have been closed.</p>
          <p eId="para_31"> We have made significant progress. The important point, for me and for the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, and the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, in the Department is that we must ensure that public service obligation, that Local Link piece, is continuing to uplift, to connect people and to ensure people have that accessible transport and connectivity.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelCollins2016" eId="spk_5">
          <from>Deputy Michael Collins<recordedTime time="2025-12-03T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_32">I appreciate that. I am on the board of Local Link and was on the board of rural transport prior to that in a voluntary capacity before I got into politics so it was not the political side that drove me; it was delivery. While it is progressing and I do not want to come in here with any kind of real negativity on it, you could see where those improvements could be made without even an added cost where an area could be included. I have put forward suggestions. At one time when it was the local transport company was in charge of things, you could get somewhere. You tend to not get anywhere today. The Minister of State needs to look at that in the budget that is there because the budget must be huge. There is no point in saying it is not costing a lot of money but people are using it.</p>
          <p eId="para_33"> I look at West Cork Connect. Damien Long rejuvenated and reopened transport in west Cork. Nobody else wanted to touch it. As soon as he did, Bus Éireann and all the rest wanted to follow suit. That is fine. There was no problem, but there are 20, 25 or 30 people waiting for a bus on the side of the road. It is great. It is a real positive, but I do not want areas such as Caheragh, Drinagh and Ballincarriga left behind when they could be included in new routes that are being put in place and that are not far away. I put that suggestion to the Minister of State. There should be no community left behind when it comes to public transport. Even if it is once or twice a day, it is at least something to start with. Some of these communities are being left behind.</p>
          <p eId="para_34"> I would not close a door on a direct transport service to the train station. Let no one come into the Dáil and say that they are connecting Ireland when there are some communities that do not have a connection within 140 km. That has to be looked at. There has to be an understanding that no Government is going to deliver rail to the people of west Cork but we certainly need a public transport connection to rail, and maybe the airport in Cork, on a daily basis. These services are hugely important for our future. I would appreciate it if the Minister of State were to take that on board for future budgets.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jerry Buttimer<recordedTime time="2025-12-03T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_35">I share Deputy Collins's ambition for west Cork. I would be happy to meet with the Deputy and the committee. Councillor Caroline Cronin had me down there during the summer. The Deputy is right. Damien Long has made a hugely positive impact for people in west Cork. As part of BusConnects and as part of the Connecting Ireland piece, there is a need for a detailed examination to develop what the Deputy discussed, if possible. As a Minister of State, given that I am from Cork, I am very much of the view that we need to look at how we can enhance services for people.</p>
          <p eId="para_36"> As a Government, we are funding smart demand responsive transport for remote areas which will extend the reach of rural transport further. Everywhere I go across the country, people are praising Local Link. They want more of it and I certainly hope we can deliver that.</p>
          <p eId="para_37"> I take the Deputy's points on board. I would be happy to go to west Cork to meet with the people in those areas. It is an important part of west Cork, even from a tourism point of view and from an economic point of view, but from a human perspective, it is one that we should look at.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pa Daly<recordedTime time="2025-12-03T09:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_39">I thank the Minister of State for coming in. Meaning no disrespect to Deputy Buttimer, we were expecting that the Minister would be here and maybe we should have got more notice of that. The Minister was not there for Oral Questions last week and he is not here this morning.</p>
          <p eId="para_40"> I have a few questions. I see that €211.283 million extra has been allocated for public transport services. I came up on the train this morning. Apart from the Dublin-to-Cork and Dublin-to-Belfast trains, there is still no trolley service on those trains. One would think that, with an extra budget of that amount, that could be facilitated at this stage. Are there any plans to do that?</p>
          <p eId="para_41"> There were leaks during the summer from the Department that we would have to choose between infrastructure and fare reduction. Fare increases for 2026 have not been ruled out. Will the Minister of State guarantee that there will not be fare increases?</p>
          <p eId="para_42"> Those are my two initial questions. One is in relation to the trolley service and the other is whether the Minister of State will guarantee that there will not be fare increases because, as he stated in his opening statement, public transport needs to be accessible and affordable for families.</p>

          <p eId="para_43">In terms of the catering trolley, it has been raised in parliamentary questions and on Commencement matters in the Seanad. Funding should be prioritised for public transport services. Catering is viewed as an ancillary service but in my opinion, as somebody who has used the train, there should be no deficit in the provision of catering on a variety of routes. It is important to recognise that the travelling public should have that level of service. It is not good enough to say that you can by a cup of coffee or tea on the platform and have to take it onto the train.</p>

          <p eId="para_44">It has been costed at approximately €2 million to restore those services. In my view, there should be direct employees of Iarnród Éireann performing that service. When there is €211 million, one would think it would be an easy fix to do on the more peripheral areas. If you were going for a medical appointment in Dublin on the Castlebar train, the Ballina train or the Tralee train where you are on the train for four hours, you do not want to be changing trains. You take the direct train and you cannot even buy a bottle of water. One would think there would be a spare €2 million out of the €211 million to do that.</p>

          <p eId="para_45">I am not disagreeing with the Deputy but I would make the point that the amount of money he speaks about relates to the provision of a public transport service. This is seen as ancillary. Maybe the model should be examined in the context of franchising.</p>

          <p eId="para_48">What about the leaks that took place suggesting fare increases have not been ruled out for 2026? Can the Minister of State guarantee that the fares will not be increased, given that he has said the measures must ensure public transport remains affordable? There has been, as he said in his opening statement, growing passenger demand. To continue to have that demand and to avoid the problems with the M50 we all saw on “Prime Time” last night, there is a need to at least maintain, but ideally increase, the passenger numbers on public transport. Will the Minister of State guarantee that the increases will not take place in the new year?</p>

          <p eId="para_49">What I will say this morning is that public transport needs to be funded. There are basically two sources of funding: fares and the Exchequer. We need to have a debate on the funding of public transport. We are having it. As the Deputy knows quite well, we have seen a huge increase in passenger numbers. The “Prime Time” programme last night illustrated that we have a capacity issue on our roads. That is why we have Connecting Ireland, BusConnects and the plans for Dublin, Cork and Galway. The plan for a Luas in Cork-----</p>

          <p eId="para_56"> On the fares, the OECD is coming in to review the funding model next year, so we will have a further competition. It is important to have the conversation.

          <p eId="para_57">I have one more question. The Minister of State is aware the average cost of an electric vehicle, EV, is over €50,000, and many cost €60,000 to €70,000. People buying those types of cars do not need a €3,500 grant. Are there proposals, given the extra money, to introduce a tiered system so people around the country, not just those in the more affluent areas of Dublin and Cork, will be able to buy cars? Maybe there should be a tiered system for rural areas and for cars that do not cost as much as those I have mentioned?</p>

          <p eId="para_58">It is a fair point. We need to incentivise people to transition to EVs. As of now, there are no plans to have a tiered approach, but I will certainly have people come back to the Deputy on that.</p>

          <p eId="para_60">In that context, we have the all-island rail review, as the Deputy knows. We saw the plans announced for Navan. It is all part of the discussion. We will examine the whole issue. The “Prime Time” programme has illustrated that an all-Ireland strategic rail review is necessary. The whole point is getting people out of the car and onto public transport. The Department is committed to that.</p>

          <p eId="para_64"> Third, what are the main drivers of the increase in the PSO cost? The Minister of State referred in his overview to contract costs, energy costs and so on. Could he give more detail on what is driving the overall increase?</p>

          <p eId="para_67">First, what are the measures to improve budgeting and forecasting for next year so we will not have a similar Supplementary Estimate again next year? Second, where is fare revenue not matching what was forecast and why is fare revenue this year down by comparison with what was forecast? Third, what are the main drivers of the PSO cost increase? Fourth, where exactly will the €71 million in TII funding for MetroLink be used?</p>

          <from>Deputy Jerry Buttimer<recordedTime time="2025-12-03T09:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_68">These developments entail a contribution scheme put in place by local authorities, which collect the money in terms of the fares and transmit to the statutory transport provider. The practice has been that every few years the Department has instructed the transport provider to remit the money to the Department. The last occasion was around 2017.</p>
          <p eId="para_69"> The significant uplift for the PSO next year is around €940 million. Fare revenue is below what it might have been due to the fare initiatives. Passenger numbers are very good overall but the fare initiatives have taken money out of the system. The PSO cost drivers include service expansion, input costs and fuel costs. These costs have increased.</p>
          <p eId="para_70"> It is difficult to give the Deputy a definitive answer on how we can ensure we will not be here next year. I believe there will always be a Supplementary Estimate for the Department of Transport. In this regard, it is a bit like the Department of Health. It is passenger led and a matter of demand. It is about the PSO. There is a commitment in the programme for Government to developing a sustainable funding model. The package we are introducing today involves a commitment to ensuring accessible public transport across the board.</p>

          <p eId="para_71">To return to fares, is the Minister saying the expansion of the Leap card to children aged between five and eight brought down the overall fare receipts forecast? Surely that was costed in. Is there a softening in demand? If the main reason for fare revenue being below what was forecast is the expansion of the Leap card to children aged between five and eight, was it not factored in when the programme was introduced? Was it done mid-year?</p>

I am just trying to understand why the cost of them was not projected a year ago and why it is impacting on the revenue. If it is the case that passenger demand is not softening, that is fantastic. That is great but it is not what I want explained. I was surprised to see lower than expected fare revenue coming in and I am trying to get the bottom of what is driving that. Is it that these initiatives have impacted fare revenue in some cases? Surely, that would have been costed when those programmes were being rolled out.</p>

          <p eId="para_110">That is fine. Yesterday and today, a number of measures are being announced in terms of significant reforms in the delivery of infrastructure. No doubt public transport is included in that. The transport plan was announced last week. In that announcement we saw allocations for projects that have already been granted planning permission, such as the Luas Finglas which was granted planning permission only four weeks ago. DART+ South West was granted planning permission a year ago. We see decisions that Luas Finglas will only go to procurement in 2027 and DART+ South West in 2028, with Luas Finglas starting in 2029 and DART+ South West starting in 2030 plus. On the planning side, these projects are out the gap. They have received their planning permission and are ready to go. Can the Minister of State understand my confusion and the very real frustration felt by commuters in Finglas, south Dublin and across Kildare in terms of planning permission having been granted and yet there being this inordinate delay of four or five years before we go to construction? Can the Minister of State explain that because I just cannot?</p>

          <p eId="para_111">First, I agree with the Deputy completely that we need to look at accelerating delivery. That is why today the Government is announcing its accelerating infrastructure development plan. </p>
          <p eId="para_112"> The Luas Finglas project was funded under the previous NDP for planning and design, and its construction start date under the approved greater Dublin area, GDA, transport strategy was for the post-2030 period. The real time means that, under the NDP, we are bringing forward the construction start date, which I think we all agree is important. That is an important one.</p>
          <p eId="para_113"> In regard to the DART+ South West project delay, it is a hugely important programme. We will see construction start on it under the NDP. We have already had the first of the new trains in Ireland undergo testing which will introduce a massive uplift in capacity on the network. The point the Deputy is making is that we all need to see and want to have accelerated delivery of projects. He is right. It is frustrating and it does impact on people. We, as politicians, want to see projects, and certain capital infrastructure projects, expedited so we can have delivery for the people.</p>

          <p eId="para_114">Yes, and the Minister of State is absolutely right to put that focus on accelerating delivery, but the transport plan for these two projects is decelerating delivery. It is actually adding years to the delivery of these projects, projects that have planning permission. Over the next number of days there will be a big debate about the planning system and various groups, environmentalists, etc., will be blamed for delaying planning. Here, it is not the environmentalists or judicial review; it is a Government decision to hold off funding on these particular projects that is failing commuters in Finglas, south Dublin and across Kildare.</p>

          <p eId="para_115">I do not necessarily think the Deputy is right on that one. If we look at it, we need DART+ West first because it fixes the capacity issues in the city centre and also allows for the construction of the new depot to house the new fleet, which will be important to serve other projects. We both share the overarching goal and philosophy which is that we must deliver projects more quickly, accelerate delivery and increase the reliability for passengers.</p>

          <p eId="para_116">I just want to express my disappointment that the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, has not appeared. I will start with the sectoral investment plan. I welcome that funding has been allocated to the western rail corridor. It has been a very long time coming and is a very important project for the west and it is key that we actually see the project delivered within the lifetime of the Government. I know there is an aim to start construction by 2028, but does the Department have any specific target for when the project will be delivered?</p>

          <p eId="para_160">The Minister of State is very welcome. Following on from the Leas-Chathaoirleach, I want to ask the Minister of State a little about the lower fare revenue performance. Passenger numbers are performing very well, with further growth expected, yet we have lower fare revenue performance and I would really like to understand why that is. It is a fairly significant supplementary amount of money the Department is looking for. I am a huge supporter of public transport. I take public transport. I got the train here today. I am one of those TDs who uses public transport. Unfortunately, however, in my area, instead of having lower fares, our fares have substantially increased. I am talking about Skerries and Balbriggan. We are not benefiting from the €2 fare. We are not benefiting from affordable and accessible public transport, as stated in the programme for Government, because our fares have substantially increased. I am a bit concerned. Our services have decreased. We have fewer train carriages. No new train carriages have been ordered since 2022 and the ones that have been ordered have not been delivered. There have been no new buses, either Dublin Bus or Bus Éireann, I understand, since 2022. We are putting a huge amount of money into the PSO levy but I am not seeing that in return for services, and my constituents are seeing it not in lower fares but in increased fares. The Minister of State might please give us a little more understanding as to why we are looking for such a huge increase in the Supplementary Estimate.</p>

          <p eId="para_161">The PSO programme, as the Deputy knows, is funded through a combination of Exchequer funding and passenger fare revenue. The fare revenue is not the main driver in 2025. The commitment is to service expansion. As regards things necessitated today, we have service expansion, we have cost increases, as the Leas-Chathaoirleach already said, and we have had, if we are honest, underfunding in recent years. Since Covid, there has been a need to review the whole structure. That has been the driver in terms of the costs. From a Government perspective, and as a Department, we are committed to ensuring that fares are competitive. I take the Deputy's point about the areas she refers to in terms of reduction in carriages-----</p>

          <p eId="para_162">A substantial increase in train fares. We are subsidising the reduction in fares further up the line and the €2 fare in Dublin, and that is just not right, particularly now when we are looking to put in a Supplementary Estimate of over €208 million.</p>

          <p eId="para_164">We must continue to review existing fare structures to ensure public transport is accessible for everyone and the delivery of services are supported. We also need to do more to incentivise and encourage people to use the off-peak period. Under the programme for Government, we are also committed to the roll-out of contactless fare payments on all public transport. What we have committed and tried to do is keep fares low and affordable, as well as examine the further expansion of free public transport for children. We will then look at the whole sustainability of the model in terms of the PSO services into the future.</p>

I have, on many occasions, discussed this with the NTA. I wrote to the NTA and asked for formulas to explain its decision.

          <p eId="para_173">In terms of the service, obviously, we have reduced train lines. I know there are issues with the train carriages. It looks like we are not going to get the new carriages until quarter 2 of 2027 at the earliest. We should look, if we can, at leasing rolling stock to try to supplement the train carriages we have. We need to look at everything we can do because the demand is there on all lines. The fact that we do not have new carriages means we cannot cascade the other carriages onto all of the other lines in the country. We need to look at what we can do. We are expecting a growth in numbers over the next couple of years but we simply do not have the buses and train carriages to meet that demand. Despite this, we are putting over €208 million into the PSO levy without additional infrastructure.</p>

          <p eId="para_175">I appreciate that. Lastly, the Minister of State mentioned off-peak services. The last train to Drogheda and Dundalk is 20 minutes to midnight during the week, which means I regularly miss my last train home. It would be great to see more off-peak services. When I get the last train, which is regularly, there is quite a demand. Having the last train to Drogheda and Dundalk on the northern commuter line at 11.40 p.m. is just not sufficient, certainly for anyone working in Leinster House. I would appreciate it if off-peak services could be looked at.</p>

          <p eId="para_176">I am giving the Deputy a personal view as opposed to a departmental one. We need to be radical in how we look at the delivery of off-peak services. I have the same issue in my constituency with, for example, workers and passengers at Cork Airport. The points the Deputy made are relevant. I certainly would love to see a more innovative, radical approach taken to off-peak services. We can have more of them. I have raised the matter with the NTA in the case of Cork, rather than the Deputy's constituency, but this may be something on which we can work and advocate together with the NTA. The Deputy makes a good point because we need to encourage people to use public transport rather than putting barriers in people's way. For example, the Deputy could have driven, although I know she said she took the train this morning, because she knows she will not make the train back home tonight. It is a fair point.</p>

          <p eId="para_180">First, it is about maintaining the service as it is. Second, the F spine is being unfurled and then there is the whole overarching umbrella of Connecting Ireland. As I said, the key cost drivers in terms of the higher PSO payments are energy, wages and network expansion. The allocation is a reflection of the Government’s commitment to reliable sustainable public transport and increasing connectivity. It is also about making sure that we roll out the two new BusConnects spines, the E spine and, in particular, the F spine. Those two new services under Connecting Ireland will be rolled out later this year or early next year. There is then the whole piece around Mullingar and Ennis which are due to commence, maybe, in quarter 1 of next year but there is no definitive date on that yet. That is part of where we are expanding the services.</p>

          <p eId="para_181">The NTA was before this committee and, obviously, my focus is Dublin West. It stated that its objective is to make what we have work. There are severe capacity issues in Dublin West, however. That was not helped by the fact that, over the last five years, in the previous term, there was an absolute lack of investment in capacity issues in Dublin West, both in existing services and areas where new housing has been built. I have been able, with the NTA, to secure an additional €700,000 this year for capacity issues in Dublin West but it is still not enough. The Minister of State mentioned earlier the underfunding in the last couple of years. We saw the “Prime Time” programme last night regarding the M50. We also see return to office mandates and an increase in congestion on our roads in the last couple of months. There is a major drive and interest in using public transport. Where does the Minister of State see all of this going?</p>

          <p eId="para_182">The Deputy raises an interesting point in asking where we see all of this going. First, I agree with her that we need to ensure the focus is on maintaining the network in terms of better punctuality and increased capacity and reliability. If we learned anything from the “Prime Time” programme last night, it is that this has an implication, and the Deputy has been a long-time champion of working from home. It also requires us to continue to fund and increase the funding for BusConnects to deliver it and have it rolled out to ensure the significant progress we all agree has been made continues. That is why the programme for Government is very much committed to ensure that BusConnects delivers. Today, that is why we have the transport accelerated development plan being put in place because all of us benefit from having enhanced public transport that is reliable and punctual.</p>
          <p eId="para_183"> It is also about continuing to work with the Deputy and others to ensure there is an augmented and enhanced upgrade of the bus fleet so that we can have that critical piece, which is reliability and accessibility. The key point for me, based on the Deputy’s experience of Dublin West, is that we continue with the network redesign programme and ensure we are a bit radical, a word I used earlier, when it comes to local routes. We need to look at how we can take some of the existing services and not just streamline the network but deliver for the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_184"> Undoubtedly, the programme last night raised issues with the M50.</p>

          <p eId="para_186">I only have two minutes. Dublin West is not going to see the roll-out of the bus route redesigns under BusConnects until 2027. We need investment in our existing services particularly in areas with new housing growth. Hollywoodrath currently has one bus service, the 40E, and it connects to Broombridge Luas station. The bus only comes every half an hour. I get emails about congestion, bus stops mobbed with people, the visible frustration of people waiting for buses at those bus stops and the knock-on effect in the area. We are getting the extension of a bus, the 40D, which I have pushed for since I became a TD, from Tyrrelstown to Hollywoodrath in March. This typifies what is happening with new housing growth and new areas. They do not get the investment they need when it comes to bus services. We feel deprioritised because we will not see BusConnects roll out until 2027.</p>

It is about next year delivering a key focus on what the Deputy has articulated but also on seeing an improvement in existing services. It goes back to my three points earlier. It is about punctuality, capacity and reliability. The travelling public the Deputy represents and speaks about are justifiably upset and disappointed.</p>

          <p eId="para_191">It is very interesting because it will be over €208 million. I asked myself what value for money will we get from €208 million. I will have to vote on this eventually in the Dáil. We in Laois got no money at all for the roads or anything like that. I said if I got some portion of that €208 million, it could be very good. I can see the Minister of State looking at me. Look back at the statistics; I did not get anything out of the last tranche.</p>
          <p eId="para_192"> I thank all of the people who run public transport at the moment. I use public transport. I do not just talk the talk, I walk the walk. I use public transport every day. The only time I cannot use public transport is when the Dáil sits after 10.30 p.m. because I cannot get the train home to Portlaoise. The last one is at 10.10 p.m. We were kept here last week until 1.40 a.m. and then we are talking about the carbon footprint. We should have a look at ourselves from that point of view. With the traffic congestion at the moment, I speak to people in my own town of Portlaoise and in County Laois. They can get public transport to their jobs, mostly people travelling up around Dublin, but other people travel the other direction down to Limerick. My point is those people do not want to be sitting in traffic. Leaving Portlaoise at the moment, if you want to be in Dublin at 8 a.m., you now have to leave at 4.20 a.m. There is no quality of life attached to that sort of commitment that person has to make. That is the gridlock. I often wonder, if Ministers used public transport and their ordinary car once a week - I think every Minister should have to use their ordinary car every Wednesday if they come up from the country - then they would see the gridlock. Then we should see changes very quickly. When you are able to motor in and out with the blue lights on, there is no headache for you. People are sitting there - a young girl told me yesterday morning it took her three and a half hours from 4.50 a.m. to get to work. She cannot get public transport to work. She has to bring her car. She would love to have public transport. There has to be joined-up thinking. We cannot just continue what is going on at the moment. There are more and more cars, lorries and vans on the roads every morning. We can all see that. I did not see the programme last night - I was on public transport on my way home when it was on. I ask the Minister of State to please do something about. It has to be done. Those people commuting are entitled to some form of a standard of living, not to be up and on the road at 5 a.m., coming home at 9 p.m., maybe 8 p.m., having to look after children. It is not fair to them. The Department is looking for €208 million. Show us what it can do to improve the quality of life for those people.</p>
          <p eId="para_193"> The hop-on, hop-off bus is fantastic. It is only after coming into Portlaoise. It is absolutely brilliant. Some people voiced their opinions about it when it came in. The problem now is it does not go to a quarter of enough of places. That is the way forward. We will have to see something like that. If there is a growth in population like we are after having - our population has nearly doubled in Portlaoise - something has to be put in so people can move from A to B. No longer can you go in cars because it takes an hour to cross the town. From that point of view, if the Department is looking for more money, show us the results at the end of the day. I always acknowledge the work that has been done. We have a good train service out of Portlaoise in the morning and home in the evening provided your job will allow you to get that train. I said already it is important there is joined-up thinking. It could be a lot better for everybody if we put that money to use.</p>

          <p eId="para_198">I have been talking to Councillor Chris Maxwell in west Mayo. There is a serious issue there in relation to the National Transport Authority. It suspended part of the bus service through Westport, Louisburgh, Killeen and Killadoon. A request from local representatives to reinstate the Killeen to Killadoon section has been refused. This decision has left residents isolated with no viable alternative for essential travel. I ask the Minister of State to acknowledge this reality. These communities are being neglected. People are forced to rely on private cars for every journey whether getting to work, school, medical appointments or simply accessing basic services. This is not just a social issue, it is a climate issue. Road transport accounts for 11.8 MtCO2eq annually and 21.5% of our national emissions are from private cars, which dominate energy use in transport. I would appreciate if the Minister of State would look at why this service was suspended. It is not easy for rural communities like this one in Mayo to have the service suspended. Councillor Chris Maxwell asked me to raise that issue at the first opportunity for the people of his area and his fellow public representatives. Will the Minister of State comment?</p>

          <p eId="para_200">I would appreciate that. In fairness, I only got it yesterday evening and I would appreciate if the Minister of State did that. I know there is a lot of money which the Minister of State spoke about earlier and there is the positive roll-out of public transport, which I noted earlier. I know he is probably not connected to this but I will turn to the roads budget. It is not his area but transport is transport and a road is a road, whether a car is being used or a tractor.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">The situation we find ourselves in in west Cork is that since the bypass for Skibbereen, which could be 30 years ago - though I could be wrong - there has not been a brown cent spent other than on pothole repair. There has not been a passing bay. With the northern relief road in Bandon, there is a couple of quid to draw up another fancy report which will probably be a nice few quid for someone along the line but my brother, Councillor John Collins, asked the other day at one of the those public meetings when there will be a bucket on the ground. People want buckets on the ground. They want their bypasses put in place. They could not tell him, so that is not going to happen. With the southern and northern relief roads for Bandon, Clonakilty relief road, Bantry relief road there is nothing other than reports and kicking the can down the road.</p>
          <p eId="para_202"> There are no passing bays either. The Minister of State told me he would come down to west Cork and I certainly will invite him at the appropriate time. However, if he comes down, especially during the summer, he could be caught from Bandon to Clonakilty behind a tractor. That is an astonishing situation to find yourself in as a motorist. I would love to tell the Minister of State to use the train but that is not there, so we have to use what is available to us. My point is simple: passing bays have not even been considered. I am not sure whether it comes under the Minister of State's brief but if it does not I would appreciate it if he could go cap in hand - because no disrespect to him but I thought it was the Minister who was going to be here and it does come under the Minister's brief - and fight for the people of west Cork. He is a Corkman and he will certainly come down to west Cork and he understands what I am saying. I am not making it up. It is not just something I have come up with off the top of my head. I am at it every day of the week. I am at it since I came into politics into 2014 at local level. Simple passing bays would be an almighty start, but nobody is willing to invest. There is no future thinking. It is just that is the way it was 25 years ago and 30 years ago, so drive on. There is more traffic on the road and we need simple passing bays on our bypasses to be got to the point where we can say in five years' time there is a bucket on the ground and it is going to happen, rather than in 25 years.</p>

          <p eId="para_203">I thank the Deputy. On the roads he refers to and requires, we are seeing an increase in funding for our road network over the next five years. It is true that the Government funds but it is also about working with the local authority and its members to ensure, whether it is the N71 or the different relief roads the Deputy is talking about, that the works take place. Certainly the volume of traffic in west Cork has increased. I am very familiar with the places the Deputy referred to. I am there quite a lot. The whole piece around safety is one we need to look at and I have spoken to the relevant authorities about that already because it is a source of concern. The Deputy made reference to tractors being stuck behind cars. He is right to because people are taking chances in some cases. I will talk to the officials in our Department about the issues he has raised. I am sure he has spoken to Cork County Council about the roads he has mentioned here. It is fair to say though we have seen funding in some of the projects the Deputy referenced. The town of Bandon in particular has benefited from some of the works we have done.

It comes to a similar thing I was getting at with the fare case. Is that not factored into account so when a new phase of BusConnects is being rolled out it is factored in at the start of the year?

We are committed to the rolling out of different phases of BusConnects. It is about that redesigned network and about ensuring with the NTA that we have the measurable aspects the Leas-Chathaoirleach speaks about so we can ensure we have a public transport system that will not necessarily have incremental supplementaries the whole time. However, it is about, as I said earlier, public service and the PSO.</p>

          <p eId="para_224">For sure. I am not disputing that at all. What I am trying to get to is on the planning. For example, we know there are issues with the F spine roll-out. There will probably be significant revision of one of the routes as part of that. That is the sort of thing I would expect a Supplementary Estimates to be called into account for. That does not strike me as the reason driving the Supplementary Estimate in this case and that is what I wanted to get to the bottom of.</p>
          <p eId="para_225"> In reference to the OECD, my understanding was it was coming in to review the fare structure as opposed to the budgeting or planning process for public transport.</p>

          <p eId="para_226">We have an underfunding of PSO in recent years and that is where we are at today. That goes back to my point earlier that the structural piece needs to be looked at in terms of how we can continue to have that sustainable model of delivery, but public transport is not going to be making money, as the Leas-Chathaoirleach knows.</p>

          <p eId="para_227">Then it falls to there being a general issue with the PSO as opposed to network expansion, because the network expansion is something we can plan for and we know what is going to happen. Are we saying that is related to the pressure that is coming on the PSO as well or is that a separate point?</p>

          <p eId="para_228">It is related. What we are looking at doing is ensuring we get that balance between the PSO payment, the increased passenger payment, the increased passenger numbers and the fare initiatives. Deputy Daly spoke about the Leap card and there is that move from cash to Leap payment. Then there is maintaining the PSO level of provision along with the fare initiatives. I make the point again we have seen passenger numbers increase. The volume is there. If you take the question of the roll-out of the new BusConnects you will have an increase in service provision which is a good news story.</p>

          <p eId="para_237">One of the most striking things from the "Prime Time" programme earlier this week about the M50 was Transport Infrastructure Ireland basically accepting that it could not fix the congestion problems on the M50. The M50 has grown to capacity and there is literally no room to expand its capacity right now. For me, that certainly makes the case for Dublin. I recognise other Deputies have spoken about the challenges they face in other parts of Ireland but as a Dublin TD, I just want to speak about Dublin for a moment. For Dublin, our solution has to be public transport based. That is why I was so disappointed in the transport plan last week to see that move away from a 2:1 spend on public transport versus roads back to a 1:1 spend because it fundamentally fails to acknowledge that for Dublin and large parts of our country, it is the investment in public transport that is going to get us out of the congestion mess we are in at the moment. I would argue that the consequence of that change is related to the points I made earlier. There is not the money to build Finglas Luas in the next five-year period. There is not the money to build DART+ South West in the next five-year period. That is why they are being bounced into the 2030 to 2050 period. It is because that decision was made. We have a certain amount of cake in the public transport budget and rather than going two thirds to one third on public transport to roads, we are reducing it by a quarter, and that means fewer public transport projects can ultimately be delivered. Therefore, I would just like an understanding in terms of the Department's perspective. How is it going to ultimately deliver the solution for commuters in Dublin city and all the surrounding commuter counties who are going in and out of Dublin every day if it is deliberately choosing to deprioritise investment in public transport?</p>

          <p eId="para_240">If the Deputy lets me finish, I am going to make the point and I am not going to have an argument because we share a common goal in terms of the Department and we in government getting people onto public transport. Under the previous Government, there was a commitment in relation to the 2:1 ratio in favour of new public transport infrastructure over new roads. The point I would make to the Deputy is the fact that this NDP has a funding ratio of at least 2:1 in favour of new public transport over new roads. That is a fact. That has not changed. That is a reality. What we need to continue to do is ensure that we deliver on our transport commitments. As I said earlier, we are ambitious around public transport. It has worked and it is working, notwithstanding the challenges we do have and that are experienced by people. However, the provision of public transport services is a commitment of the Government. We have seen it across the country. I disagree with the Deputy in terms of the interpretation he has of the plan. The M50 piece last night on "Prime Time" illustrated the importance of getting BusConnects and delivering on our various rail projects. I am going to dovetail into other parts of the country here, particularly Cork, and Deputy O'Hara mentioned Galway. We need to make sure people are not stuck in traffic and that they have better public transport. That is for the Government to address in this regard.</p>

I am a little bit puzzled to hear the Minister of State arguing that the 2:1 ratio is still there when the political message going out across the Government is that 2:1 is not there. When I did the sums on what was published last week, I cannot see 2:1 being there either. The Minister of State's comments on that would be helpful.</p>

The big issue is the threat of compulsory purchase order, CPO, whereby many landowners were being threatened with CPO, particularly at a very early stage in the process, which is not the correct way that should be carried out. I would like to hear the Minister of State and Department's views on the CPOs and whether he will be pursuing any changes to the process or at least ensuring the process is being followed correctly by TII.</p>

          <p eId="para_255"> The code will be reviewed next year. However, I would make the point to the Deputy that in the context of some of the projects he raised, there needs to be proper engagement.

I will make the point very genuinely as somebody who thinks the greenways are a benefit to our communities that something is fundamentally wrong when people who never protest or never get involved in a dispute are exercised beyond belief. That is not good enough. I certainly believe there needs to be a better and more meaningful engagement with the people in question. TII-----</p>

We have capacity issues on rail services across the State, particularly in my constituency with rail services in and out of Galway. There are huge capacity issues on many of the peak services. Some of them have only two carriages, for example the 7.49 a.m. service each morning from Limerick via Athenry to Galway. The issue is that we have new carriages coming on the DART line that will allow the older diesel carriages to go to the regional routes, but we are talking about 2027 before that is scheduled to happen. People in my constituency who are being left behind on the platform and crowded and jammed into unsafe carriages cannot wait for two years or more for those improvements and additional capacity on these services. Is that something the Department is looking at and engaging with Irish Rail on? Is there any way to accelerate that process to get new carriages in place quicker?</p>

For me, the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, and the Minister of State, Deputy Canney, who is responsible for rail, it is about ensuring we get people onto rail. It is about engaging with the relevant stakeholders to ensure we have a delivery of service. It is also about ensuring that in doing all of that, we provide a service that is reliable and gets people to their point of destination in a safe way.

          <p eId="para_275">There was a deliberate decision though to prioritise new routes over enhancing or sustaining existing services. That is obvious. I turn to the NDP sectoral plan announced last week and to DART+ West. We are through planning, there are no legal issues and it is included in the sectoral plan to start construction in 2027. There is an indicative figure of €1 billion. Is that just for the start of the construction? Will more funding have to be allocated at a later stage? Will the project be broken down into different phases? Does it have to go through any further public spending gates or is that it?</p>

          <p eId="para_276">In the context of any project there will be that transparency piece and the different gates that have to be navigated to ensure the project is transparent. The Department will engage with the relevant stakeholders. In the context of the timeline today, with the publication of the accelerated infrastructure plan it is about ensuring we deliver projects quicker, on time and on budget. The actual project costs will vary. In the context of the €1 billion, it is the standard Department of public expenditure cost band. That is what it is allocated under. It is not the actual specific project cost. The short answer to the Deputy is that yes, it will require further approvals, because if it did not the Deputy would come in here on a different day with a different set of questions. That is part of what we do. The question perhaps is if we should take the accelerated infrastructure plan and use that for some of the projects the Deputy spoke about there.</p>

          <p eId="para_277">We have to look at the hurdles involved in progressing essential State infrastructure. The NDP sectoral plan allocates €1 billion plus to DART+ West. I do not want to be sitting here in a year's time in front of the NTA saying it has to wait for another allocation to start the next phase, especially with MetroLink and the problems that have to be overcome legally with that. We need to push on and reduce the number of gates and stages to try to construct this piece of infrastructure as soon as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_278">I agree with the Deputy. We need to do things better and faster. DART+ West will need to go to tender and then for further approval to have the contract signed.</p>

          <p eId="para_280">What we all share is the need to accelerate delivery on behalf of people. I was in Qatar recently and they were building infrastructure projects much faster than here. That poses the question of why and what we can do differently. That fundamental question needs to be addressed by us, as a State. That will have an implication for people at local level perhaps but what serves the greater good?</p>

          <p eId="para_282">What influence does the Minister of State have in talking to Irish Rail as regards trains going through Portlaoise on to Ballybrophy that can take students to Thurles and places like that? Is there any joined-up thinking because I have loads of students who would love to go on the train? Their parents would love to have them on the train. As the Minister of State knows, even secondary schools are having a problem now because there are students driving to school.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">In my day, going to school, no one had a car. I remember one young lad coming in a tractor, but that was all. It was not me. Could there be more joined-up thinking from that point of view to get the best possible results from our time on the tracks?</p>
          <p eId="para_284"> The railway track is the most truesome infrastructure that we have in this country. It is not that long since somebody, somewhere, decided to take up tracks. I would love to know what the thinking behind closing down railways was. I will leave that aside, because it is not a history lesson here. I would love to see more openings for carriages on trains and more stopping of trains at particular times. Even in the school terms, if there was a change, that would allow students to be brought from A to B. That would be great.</p>
          <p eId="para_285"> In the national development plan, in this famous envelope, the Portlaoise northern orbital route is not contained in the first round that was opened the other day. Who actually says what is to be done? Who actually says we are going to put a road here and not put a road there? If you take the town I represent now, it has north of 30,000 people in it. You see other places that have half of that population getting something. I want to know who that group of people are. I would love to sit down with them and ask them to tell me why we did not tick boxes. I would love to know that, because as the Minister of State knows, all our traffic is coming through Portlaoise and all going to the west of Ireland. It has nowhere else to go. It cannot hide. We are going down by schools and everything like that. I cannot understand, in my head, why the Portlaoise northern orbital route is not up at the top. I would like the people sitting there to tell me why they are not doing it.</p>

On the NDP envelope regarding the roads, the short answer is that the local authority, as the Deputy knows as a long-time public representative, is the statutory roads authority. It makes requests. It prioritises-----</p>

          <p eId="para_12">You are all very welcome to today's meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts. Before we proceed, I have a few housekeeping matters to go through. Members are reminded of the provisions in Standing Order 226 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government, or the merits of the objectives of such policies. Members are also reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I remind members of the constitutional requirement that in order to participate in public meetings, members must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex. Members of the committee attending remotely must do so from within the precincts of Leinster House.</p>
          <p eId="para_13"> The agenda for today is No. 1, accounts and statements, No. 2, correspondence, and No. 3, upcoming meetings. We will then suspend and begin the engagement with officials from Uisce Éireann at 10.30 a.m. Before we go into the next item, I congratulate a former member of this committee, Uachtarán-elect, Catherine Connolly, who did tremendously in the election. I commend her. She was a diligent, productive member of the public accounts committee, both in this term and in previous terms. I am sure all members would agree that she did this committee proud and she will do the State and country proud when she is inaugurated next Tuesday. That is just to note that. I do not know whether any members want to speak.</p>

          <p eId="para_14">I, too, congratulate President-elect Catherine Connolly. It is probably the first time in the history of the State that a member of the Committee of Public Accounts has become President of Ireland, so it can be said that there is hope for us all. I am a new member of this committee but all of us who are new and those who sat on the previous committee can recognise and observe the experience and talent that she brought to this committee. She will be a loss to this committee, but this committee's loss is Ireland's gain. We wish Catherine Connolly well as President of Ireland and I look forward to her inauguration.</p>

          <p eId="para_15">I also want to congratulate Catherine. It is fitting that the seat beside me is empty, because that is the one in which she always preferred to sit. I am delighted for Catherine. She proved herself to be a brilliant candidate in an election that she won convincingly. We all recognise that. She will make a great Uachtarán na hÉireann for us all, as she said. I also want to speak on my personal engagement with her here. She was very knowledgeable as she went about her business dealing with people. Anything she said was articulate, intelligent, not aggressive and she did not have to push too hard, but at the same time, she was able to get her point across and was inquisitive. I learned much from watching her do her business. I look forward to watching her with her elevated status. Congratulations to Catherine. I look forward to meeting her on Tuesday.</p>

          <p eId="para_16">I would also like to congratulate Catherine on her astounding victory. She did fantastically. I commend her on her first words of wisdom, that she would bring Irish to Áras an Uachtaráin and that would be the working language as Uachtarán. I would also like to present an idea here, that on the 100th anniversary of the Committee of Public Accounts, we could invite Catherine as she was a former member.</p>

          <p eId="para_17">I would also like to extend my congratulations to Catherine. I did not get to know her that well because I was in the Seanad, but I followed her campaign, which was extraordinary and a huge success. I am really excited to go to her inauguration. It will be the first inauguration I have ever been to. I wish her well. She will definitely be a loss to our committee.</p>

          <p eId="para_18">I echo the words of the other members and note my own congratulations to President-elect Connolly. As the others have said, her experience here was very obvious from the word go. I am sorry I did not get to share the committee a bit more with her to learn from her experience, but so be it. She will be a loss to the Committee of Public Accounts, but obviously she is now elevated to being the first citizen of the nation. It is a proud moment for her and I wish her all the best in that role.</p>

          <p eId="para_19">As the Vice Chair of the Committee of Public Accounts, I want to congratulate Catherine on her amazing victory. I know that the diligence that she brought to this committee will be something that she brings to the Áras. The thing that always impressed me the most about Catherine was that it was very obvious that she had consumed all of the briefing material and more in advance of hearings here. I know when we were selecting a Vice Chair for the committee, it could as easily have been Catherine as me. If that is the height of my achievement, I will be happy to be included in her company.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">Whoever is looking after the finances in Áras an Uachtaráin better have a keen eye because, I have no doubt that President-elect will be keeping an eye on them.</p>

          <p eId="para_21">I also wish to offer my congratulations to Catherine. As a new member of this committee, I was very privileged to sit beside her. As my colleagues have said, she came in here and put us all to shame with her scribbles and notes on every single page. She knew her brief inside out. I have every confidence that she will take that diligence and intensity into her new role. I wish her very well, and I look forward to welcoming her back.</p>

          <p eId="para_22">Thanks, Deputy Byrne. I agree with the views of all members. It is notable that Catherine's chair has been left vacant. No one has the courage to take it just yet. She will be a loss to the committee and to the Oireachtas in general. It will be Ireland's gain to have her as its first citizen. I congratulate her. I think an invitation has been sent or will be sent to her to attend the event relating to the 100th anniversary of the PAC. It would be good to see her there.</p>

          <p eId="para_26">We will move on to No. 5. The minutes of the meeting of 23 October 2025 have been agreed and will be published on the committee's website. At that meeting, officials from the Department of justice asked to make a clarification in respect of one of their responses in the committee to a question from Deputy Ardagh regarding the maximum number of prisoners that the State had in custody. The official stated that the highest number, some 5,699, was recorded on the day prior to the meeting, which would have meant that prison system was at 110% of capacity. The Department wishes to correct the record and has stated that the correct figure was 5,599, meaning that the system was operating at 120% of capacity.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> Ten sets of accounts and financial statements laid before the committee between 20 October and 31 October 2025 and are due to be considered today. We are joined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, who is a permanent witness to the committee. I will ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to address these before opening the floor to members.</p>

          <p eId="para_28">Go raibh maith agat. No. 1 is the accounts of the National Lottery Fund for 2024, which received a clear audit opinion. No. 2 is the Regulator of the National Lottery financial statements for 2024, which received a clear audit opinion. No. 3 is the account of the State property miscellaneous deposits account for 2024, which received a clear audit opinion.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> No. 4 is the financial statements of St. James's Hospital for 2024, which received a clear audit opinion. The turnover figure there is incorrect. I will seek a correction in that regard for the committee. Apart from issuing a clear audit opinion, I drew attention to three matters. First, a material level of procurement non-compliance, which continues from year to year. Second, claims to the value of €396,000 were rejected by private insurers on the basis that the hospital had not finalised the claims within the required timeframe. Third, services to the value of €1.44 million were purchased from an unlimited company owned by employees of St. James' Hospital in circumstances where no formal contract was in place and for which most services were not subject to an open, competitive process. In addition, we identified that employees had not declared their interests in the company in annual declarations of interest. Both of the items there were replicated previously. I drew attention to similar issues with Children's Health Ireland, CHI, and in the HSE.</p>

          <p eId="para_30">The C and AG provided some context when he mentioned how a similar issue had arisen in the context of CHI. I want to be clear about what he identified. He said that the hospital paid €1.44 million to a company that was owned by employees of the hospital and there was no public procurement process in relation to the contract.</p>

          <p eId="para_32">Those moneys would have come from the revenue of the hospital, which is taxpayer money, by and large. Not only that, but there are obligations on employees to submit declarations of interest. Where do those declarations go?</p>

          <p eId="para_39">They disclosed the facts. I would expect to see maybe a doubling down on declarations of interests and more action being taken to ensure that such declarations are made. There is not an obligation, necessarily, on somebody who does not have interests to declare to make a declaration. It would be good practice to issue a nil-interests declaration. If someone has an interest, however, there is an obligation to disclose it.</p>

          <p eId="para_40">This is something that the committee will have to come back to. We should bring representatives of St James' Hospital before the committee to answer on a fairly huge chunk of money that has been handed over to a company owned by employees. That is quite startling and it is in line, as the C and AG said, with issues that have arisen in CHI. Those involved need to be answerable and accountable for what happened.</p>

          <p eId="para_43">I suggest that, in the first instance, we write to the board of St. James's Hospital in order to get a full briefing on this matter because it is very serious. A significant amount of money was spent without the proper processes being undergone. I agree that this is a matter to which the committee will return. We will wait for a response to our correspondence and make a decision at that stage. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>

          <p eId="para_44">Thanks, Chair. I will come back before the end of the meeting with the correct turnover figure.</p>
          <p eId="para_45"> No. 5 is the financial statements of the Marine Institute for 2024, which received a clear audit opinion. No. 6 is the financial statements of An Bord Iascaigh Mhara for 2024, which received a clear audit opinion. No. 7 is the financial statements of the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority for 2024, which received a clear audit opinion. No. 8 is the financial statements of the National Pediatric Hospital Development Board for 2024, which received a clear audit opinion. In that case there was a qualified opinion. The accounts, in my view, give a true and fair view, except that they account for the costs of retirement benefit entitlements only as they become payable, but that is a standard approach for many health bodies. No. 9 is the financial statements of the Royal Irish Academy for 2024, which received a clear audit opinion. No. 10 is the financial statements of the Technological University Dublin for the year of account 1 September 2023 to 31 of August 2024.</p>
          <p eId="para_46">The financial statements received a clear audit opinion but I drew attention to two matters. The university incurred a deficit of €8.2 million for the year ended 31 August 2024, following a deficit in the prior period of account of €8.4 million. Note 29 explains how the governing body is satisfied to present the financial statements on a going concern basis. I also drew attention to the fact that the draft 2024 financial statements were submitted for audit only in May 2025, which was almost six months after the target deadline of November 2024. This was due to ongoing capacity issues. In addition, following the audit, significant adjustments were required to the results stated for the year of account. Normally the audit would be expected to confirm the financial statements that would be presented. It is a matter of concern it was not in a position to present the draft on time and for the draft to be correct.</p>

          <p eId="para_47">With regard to Technological University Dublin, the final operating results has been adjusted from the initial draft submitted in May 2025 by approximately €3.85 million and this relates to certain payroll matters. I am trying to reconcile in my mind how payroll matters might amount to such a large sum. It would seem like a large sum. The second line looks like a routine matter. Will Mr. McCarty tell us the nature of what this is?</p>

          <p eId="para_48">There were three matters that required adjustment. First, there was an accrual. A requirement for back pay which totalled €0.47 million had to be recognised. There was also a provision for funding under the Building Momentum pay agreement. The agreement allocated 1% of basic pay to sectors to deal with outstanding complaints, and it was appropriate for it to recognise an accrual in respect of this to the total €1.3 million. The final element was a provision for hourly paid part-time assistant lecturers. There was an accrual of €2.1 million where there was an agreement to compensate staff in respect of the terms of their contracts. This also needed to be recognised.</p>

          <p eId="para_51">The financial statements were submitted six months behind schedule and then, following the audit, significant adjustments were required. This is quite concerning in my view. That they did not meet the timeline and then significant changes were needed points to a litany of failures. Will Mr. McCarthy go into some of the amendments that were required to the result?</p>

          <p eId="para_52">They are the items I just mentioned for the Deputy. It is significant. A board is entitled to know at all times, and should be able to know at all times, what the financial position is, how much has been spent and what the trading position is for the year. Some of these matters were identified as needing to be recognised in 2023 and 2024. They will not necessarily be recurring items. It is already in a significant financial deficit position. To have deficits of €8 million two years in a row is quite significant. It is engaging with the Higher Education Authority in relation to its financial management. I would expect that we will not be seeing a repetition of these matters and that the performance in relation to the 2024-25 period of account will be significantly better.</p>

          <p eId="para_74">As members are aware, Uisce Éireann is Ireland's national water utility company responsible for developing and maintaining water and wastewater infrastructure, and for providing related services. Its operations are regulated by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_75"> The income statement indicates that Uisce Éireann had revenue from its continuing operations totalling €1.6 billion in 2024. Government subvention funding accounted for just over €1.1 billion, representing over two thirds of the company’s operating revenue. The subvention is provided in substitution of the company’s estimated potential income from domestic water charges. Revenues in 2024 from non-domestic water charges were €272 million. Fees for new connections generated income of €195 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_76"> Uisce Éireann’s operating costs totalled just over €1 billion in 2024. Uisce Éireann incurred expenditure totalling €336 million in 2024 in relation to hired and contracted-out services. The company incurred expenditure of €159 million in respect of its own employee costs. A further €138 million was incurred in relation to costs arising from long-standing agreements with local authorities. These comprise payments in respect of local authority staff and other costs associated with the continuing involvement of local authorities in the delivery of water and wastewater services. Uisce Éireann’s operating profit for 2024 was €332 million. Unusually for a body on which I report, it incurred tax charges of €42.5 million in 2024. As a result, the profit after tax and net finance costs was €279 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_77"> During 2024, Uisce Éireann invested €1.32 billion in capital projects. At the end of 2024, the company held €8 billion in property, plant and equipment. Deferred revenue totalling €334 million was held at the year-end in respect of new connection fees. These fees are received in advance of development and are recognised as revenue once the related connections are made.</p>
          <p eId="para_78"> As set out in note 25, the State funding of Uisce Éireann extends significantly beyond the recurring subvention in substitution of domestic water charges. In 2024, Uisce Éireann received a capital contribution of €571.7 million issued from subhead B5 of the water services programme of Vote 34. This brought the aggregate capital contribution to €4.5 billion at the year end. Uisce Éireann also has a €1 billion loan facility, agreed with the Minister for Finance in 2020, drawn from the Central Fund of the Exchequer. The facility was put in place to allow Uisce Éireann to repay non-domestic commercial debt it had previously taken on and to fund its future non-domestic water borrowing requirements. A sum of €644 million was drawn during 2024, bringing the total drawdown to end 2024 to €998.6 million.</p>

          <p eId="para_81">Go raibh maith agaibh, a Chathaoirligh and members of the committee. I thank them for the invitation to discuss our financial statements for 2024, as laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and published on our website as part of our annual report. As this is our first meeting with many of them, we provided a short high-level submission, which gives an overview of our role, governance structure, as well as financial and performance highlights from 2024.</p>
          <p eId="para_82"> Uisce Éireann has been subject to annual audits by the Comptroller and Auditor General since 2023. We are pleased to have received a clear audit opinion for the second year in a row for 2024. This is testament to our robust well-established system of internal controls, policies and processes that ensure overall consistency and compliance by staff across the organisation. We thank our board for their ongoing governance and oversight.</p>
          <p eId="para_83"> The year 2024 was the final year of Uisce Éireann’s third regulatory revenue cycle, which ran from 2020. During this period, we invested more than €5 billion upgrading and improving water and wastewater infrastructure and assets. Last year, we invested an estimated €1.37 billion in capital improvements, which was a record amount. This included the completion of 17 new and upgraded wastewater treatment plants and nine water treatment plants; the laying or rehabilitation of hundreds of kilometres of water mains and sewer network; and the daily treatment of some 1.7 billion litres of water and 1.3 billion litres of wastewater across the country. These projects and programmes addressed our regulatory compliance obligations, created capacity for growth and supported the implementation of Government policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_84"> Some strategic milestones from 2024 include the completion of the Saggart reservoir project, which delivered €59 million to improve security and resilience of supply for hundreds of thousands of people across the greater Dublin area, and progression of the final phases of the €139 million Arklow wastewater treatment plant, eliminating the discharge of raw sewage into the River Avoca. Its official completion was earlier this year, six months ahead of schedule. We completed the Troyswood water treatment plant serving Kilkenny city, with an investment of €33 million, removing the area from the EPA’s list of vulnerable water supplies. Significant progress was also achieved against the Athlone main drainage scheme, which is due to be completed later this year at a total investment of €114 million. In parallel, we continued to implement and progress one of the largest transformation programmes across the State, bringing all water services under one single national utility through the transfer of operational responsibility, knowledge and skills from local authorities to Uisce Éireann. These are just some of the projects and programmes we delivered across the country last year, but they demonstrate our capacity to leverage Exchequer funding to create lasting benefits, including safeguarding public health, protecting the environment and enabling communities to thrive.</p>
          <p eId="para_85"> We have received clear commitment from the Government to support our continued work, prioritising areas identified through national and regional plans to enable housing, economic and environmental goals. Our strategic funding plan covering the period to 2029 includes €10.3 billion worth of investment in infrastructure and assets. This, with commitment to an additional ring-fenced investment of €2 billion to 2030 under the national development plan, provides record funding for water and wastewater services infrastructure. Uisce Éireann welcomes this additional funding. We set out a clear case for its need and we are working closely with the Government and stakeholders to realise this funding and deliver on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_86"> To this end, there are a number of important milestones and underpinning dependencies. A key step in this process is the upcoming consultation by the CRU, our economic regulator, on Uisce Éireann’s draft fourth revenue cycle and capital investment plan for 2025 to 2029. The outcomes of this process will ensure we have a robust set of objectives and priorities to deliver against and be accountable for. Uisce Éireann is also playing a central role in the accelerating infrastructure task force established by the Minister, Deputy Chambers, both through my own participation in the steering group and through our direct secondee to the Department of Public Expenditure, Infrastructure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation. We are working closely to identify and resolve the barriers to delivery of key infrastructure, address regulatory and legislative burden, and create an efficient, co-ordinated approach to achieve national objectives. We also have a secondee to the housing activation office under the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage as we continue to support the Government in the delivery of its housing policy. Progress against our strategically important national infrastructure projects, the water supply project eastern and midlands region and the greater Dublin drainage, GDD, project, is paramount to unlocking capacity, ensuring resilience and reliability, and delivering for the common good.</p>
          <p eId="para_87"> We welcome July’s planning approval by An Coimisiún Pleanála for GDD. It is disappointing the decision is being challenged for a second time but we remain focused on the delivery of this essential project and are committed to commencing delivery as soon as possible. For the water supply project, WSP, we will be submitting our planning application by the end of the year and hope to see its timely progress through the necessary processes.</p>
          <p eId="para_88"> Further delay to these two strategic national infrastructure projects will have serious consequences for the delivery of housing and broader economic growth and development. It could also significantly hinder our progress towards essential climate and environmental objectives, putting both local communities and the wider environment at risk. By investing in resilient, sustainable water and wastewater infrastructure, we are enabling prosperity, safety and well-being for all. This guides our decision-making and reinforces our resolve to deliver real and lasting benefits for generations to come.</p>
          <p eId="para_89"> We welcome today’s discussion on our financial statements for 2024 as a means of demonstrating how we are delivering on this commitment on behalf of the Exchequer. In a follow-up to this meeting we would welcome the opportunity to invite the committee to visit one of our infrastructure sites in the near future so all members can see first hand the scale and significance of our operations.</p>

Per head of population, our network is twice the size of Germany's so we cannot say that people are not tapping in. We know there are places with connections that should be metered that are not metered but we are continuously improving the information we have in our database. Over the past 18 months, we have set up a dedicated system within Uisce Éireann and a dedicated team whose job is to look after metering of domestic and non-domestic customers.</p>

          <p eId="para_142">With regard to any of that, has there ever been a request from the State for any dividends to be paid back to it?</p>

          <p eId="para_143">No. The reality of this is we have a very intensive capital investment plan over the next number of years. All of that money goes straight into our capital pot. Yes, the profit would typically be given back to the State as a dividend if we were a commercial organisation but the reality is we have such a large investment plan from years of underinvestment that we have no choice but to invest it.</p>

          <p eId="para_168">Perfect. I want to jump back to the point Mr. Gleeson made regarding the people coming over from the local authorities. This relates to one of the issues I came across in my time as a councillor when talking to local contractors. Is there a risk that people are not coming across? First, how many people from the local authorities are left? I know this will run until 2026. Are still a significant number? Can we get an indication of the number of people who will be coming across?</p>

          <p eId="para_169">I will ask Ms Attridge to come in on the details. It is certainly challenging. We are encouraging as many of the local authority staff as possible to come across. Some have been with the local authorities for years and would prefer to be redeployed. That is understandable. Where we have those skills gaps, we are having pretty good success in recruiting in the market here as well. Ms Attridge might elaborate on the number of transfers.</p>

We have just over 1,200 local authority staff still working in water services.

          <p eId="para_175">I guessed as much. I just wanted to clarify that.</p>
          <p eId="para_176"> One other issue is the brain drain. Knowledge loss is something I would be afraid of. I was talking to a local engineer about specific pipes. There is almost a kind of wizardry that goes with someone who has been operating in a place for 30 years and knows the direction in which particular pipes go. It is like a labyrinth underground, and none of us fully realises the knowledge of that guy who is in his late 50s and has worked in a place for 30 or 40 years until he steps across to, say, be the engineer in Kildare County Council. Is there a fear about that?</p>

          <p eId="para_177">That is something we were very concerned about. We have lost a lot of local authority staff in the last 12 months, either by way of retirement or they have moved back to the local authority already. However, we have got in a lot of really good, skilled people as well. Through it all, there has been a huge transformation programme. All of the services remain quite stable, however. We have programmes in place. When we bring in new people, we have mentoring programmes. If somebody is leaving, we do a lot of knowledge capture. We are trying to systemise a lot of our information, get contingency maps done and get everything on our GIS, so we are not relying on individuals.</p>

          <p eId="para_225">I ask the Deputy to hear me out on this. Back in 2013 there was a pay agreement whereby we have a market-based pay model. The market-based pay model has two components: one is the base salary and the other is pay at risk. If there is pay at risk, the person is incentivised to work harder and incentivised more to deliver objectives. It is rather than an incremental system. For example, if the person is working within the local authority, he or she is on an increment system which is based on the number of years. The person could be doing the same thing for ten years but getting an increase every year automatically. In this situation, the person will not get an increase year on year automatically; it has to be benchmarked and it is based on performance objectives. We are a high-performing utility similar, to the ESB and Gas Networks Ireland, GNI, and so on.</p>

Irish Water was established as a standalone utility with the expectation that there would be income from domestic and non-domestic customers. I suppose the vast majority of the income now comes from the State and there is no expectation that it will be any other way in the future. I want to look at the structural things that are left as a result of the model that was placed on Irish Water, and whether there are additional costs as a result of that. The first one mentioned was the pay model that is applied. Mr. McCarthy's clarification around increments versus pay at risk is interesting. Has Irish Water ever done a comparison between the two models as to which would be more expensive?</p>

On transfers over, Uisce Éireann has taken the income away from the local authorities in terms of commercial charges - Uisce Éireann now receives it rather than them. Uisce Éireann might take the staff member over but it leaves the pension responsibility with the local authorities. The local authorities might have had 20 or 30 years of those people being employed with them and they have the pension responsibility for those people, but Uisce Éireann has taken the income from the local authority.

Drinking water quality in Cork city has been a significant issue in recent times, particularly from the Lee Road plant and the issues there with high levels of manganese.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">There have been samples that the HSE has verified are at such a high level that they would pose a risk if they were consumed on an ongoing basis, and most people do consume water on an ongoing basis.

          <p eId="para_401">We have made really good progress in the past 12 months. We have put in additional measures at our treatment plant to optimise the process. We now remove manganese at source, and we have adjusted the alkalinity so that we are not impacting on the network. In comparison to October two years ago, when we had close to 300 customer complaints coming in, this October there were fewer than 40. That is back down to the baseline levels there would always be in a city like Cork, where there is a huge old network. In Cork, there is 300 km of old cast-iron network. Cork has, in the past two years, replaced 30 km. That is 10% of the network that has been replaced. There has been huge investment in Cork in trying to upgrade the network.</p>

In terms of communications with politicians and with customers, I noted the report of the CRU 2023 does mention some what I would consider serious failures, such as failure to report on key customer metrics resulting in a formal non-reporting letter from the CRU, some 62,000 affected by boil water notices lasting more than 30 days when the target is zero, and the customer charter and compensation rights seem to be completely and utterly unknown to the customers. If people complain to Uisce Éireann directly, they may be entitled to compensation, yet as we can see with more than 8,000 complaints to politicians who have followed up it, they are coming to us. There seems to be a gap in knowledge. Uisce Éireann’s customers do not seem to realise that if they went directly to Uisce Éireann, they might be eligible for compensation. What steps is it taking to rectify that?</p>

Residents are going around in circles, as are potential homeowners and public representatives. Issues are complicated. There does not seem to be anyone whom we can pick up the phone and speak to. We get emails back and, to be honest, they do not really tell us very much. They refer to instructing a developer to avail of an alternative connection point or that the design for the connection point has yet to be agreed. Essentially, the reply is "not with us". There is no one that we can have a conversation with to talk about how we move these things along. Is there a process? I have more complicated questions than that.

It very much works with developers to address technical issues and to help with any issues that may arise during planning, and also to work on the detail of those applications with respect to water services as they come through our process, and identifying where it is possible to connect and where we can facilitate it.</p>
          <p eId="para_467"> Right across our organisation, from within customer to infrastructure delivery and asset management, we are always trying to find ways to enable development and to say "Yes".

Where they relate to a one-off house, I hope she understands that it could be complicated. For large developments, we have a specialised team in place. The small one-off connections are coming through our call centre. We have a new team in place there as well to try to fast-track that.

          <p eId="para_470">I thank the witnesses very much for joining us. I come from Drogheda, the largest town in the country. I am sure the witnesses are well aware that there is a huge development boom, both infrastructure and much-needed housing, under way in the northern environs of Drogheda. There are also significant plans for the next five to seven years. There are concerns that capacity constraints in Uisce Éireann will impact on the delivery of houses and much-needed access to the port with the port access northern cross route, PANCR. Those who are aware of Drogheda will know the first phase of the PANCR, which was delivered in the last couple of years, was funded and aided by development levies. The housing and the roads go hand in hand. We need the road to unlock the residential development and we need the housing to perhaps fund part of the road. Will the witnesses give me an update on where we are at currently with the plans for water and wastewater treatment in the north of Drogheda to be able to facilitate the boom and growth that will come in the next couple of years?</p>

          <p eId="para_471">Perhaps we could send the Deputy a note on Drogheda in particular. With any large town, we are endeavouring to ensure those plans are in place. We might just take that away in order to give the Deputy the specifics that she would need in a note.</p>
          <p eId="para_472"> We work very closely with the local authorities. We have a forward planning team and we engage quite a lot in the plan-making process to ensure that we are aligned. The new Planning and Development Act has extended the length of those plans, which I think will help us all to be more aligned and to plan better for the future as well. We endeavour to share our information in terms of our capacity registers with the local authorities and they share their plans with us. In that way, we are trying to deliver in a plan-led way and find solutions in the interim if a development is moving at a faster pace than we might have anticipated.</p>

          <p eId="para_473">I appreciate that. I do not want to put Ms O'Dwyer on the spot, but I would appreciate it if she could send me a note on Drogheda.</p>
          <p eId="para_474"> It is heartening to hear Ms O'Dwyer say Irish Water has a good relationship with the local authorities and it works with them. A relationship is needed with developers as well to ensure that the infrastructure is in place to support the delivery of much-needed homes. Like some of my colleagues who spoke before me said, we have already met difficulties in regard to some of the development that has been delivered recently. I refer to Beaulieu Banks on the Termonfeckin Road, which is the most recent one. New homeowners were held up for a number of months recently as they tried to get connections. These houses are badly needed in the middle of a massive housing crisis. It can be very difficult. As elected representatives, we are the first point of contact. We go to the local authority, which tell us they are impressing on Irish Water the volume of applications that are in the system. The developers have not mentioned the developer liaison teams Irish Water referenced. They are telling us they cannot get answers. There is a huge difficulty already. I have major concerns that with 5,000 houses and a potential population growth of 20,000 people coming in the next five years, we will meet more difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_475"> I also have huge concerns about capacity. As a councillor in 2018, I visited the Stalleen water treatment plant when the new pipeline was being delivered. At that stage, we got a figure of the export rate being 30,000 cu. m of water being delivered a day in Stalleen at that time. The new pipeline was not going to deliver much more than that. It was going to improve efficiency, but it was not going to increase capacity. Seven years later, we already have 2,000-plus new houses added on to the capacity requirement, with another 4,000 to 5,000 to come over the next few years. I and every other elected representative in Drogheda, be it a councillor or TD, past or present, have major concerns about capacity. Any information and, in particular, reassurance that Irish Water could give would be appreciated. The witnesses could also highlight areas that we could help them with, as we are not just here to criticise. We are a point of contact, not just for the people who live in the area but for developers as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_476"> We are relying on all these houses to deliver much-needed community infrastructure and sporting amenities such as new football stadiums and municipal pitches. There is a new IDA park coming in and we hope to attract FDI companies. Everything hinges on utilities. It is not just Uisce Éireann, because we also have difficulties with the ESB, which I am sure the witnesses can appreciate. There is a real fear that all of this will hamper the growth of the town and the infrastructure that is needed to support it.</p>

          <p eId="para_481"> The third comment I would make is that the future of the water supply for the Drogheda area, which is dependent on Stalleen and Cavan Hill, is dependent on the water supply from the Shannon going across to the greater Dublin area, so we can stop taking water from Stalleen and Cavan Hill and feeding it to Dublin and we can direct it towards Dundalk and Drogheda.</p>

          <p eId="para_497">The number of homes is not particularly large. It is interesting to note that 70% of all the applications we get for connections are for developments of ten houses or fewer. Many of the extant developer-provided infrastructure, DPI, cases relate to developments of fewer than 25 houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_498"> I could not give the Deputy a cost at the moment because that team I mentioned that we have put in place is assessing every single DPI. We have yet to settle on a final figure because, as we work across the various local authorities, we are finding more that were not listed in the initial survey. All I can say is that it will take about ten years. Some of the solutions are relatively complex because the discharge from existing wastewater treatment plants is going into water bodies, causing environmental damage. We will have to consider a different mechanism for the disposal of the wastewater. I would not like to mislead the committee by giving it a figure. It will be substantial; there is no doubt about that. It is going to take time. However, the technical details associated with getting things fixed are relatively straightforward. The legal issues associated with maintenance and acquiring ownership from companies that have become defunct, acquiring wayleave and acquiring rights of way and access are where the challenges will arise. That will be time-consuming.</p>

I represent the northside of Cork city, where the water quality has been absolutely disastrous for a number of years. I want to refer to the number of complaints made, as mentioned by Deputy McGrath. The number of complaints has come down because people are not complaining anymore. They are sick and tired of complaining; that is why the number has come down. Two friends of mine living on Lee Road, Cork, took a brown shower on Tuesday night. They did not make a complaint whereas previously they would have. That is why the number of complaints has fallen.</p>

We have extensive flushing programmes in those areas. We have been proactive in our flushing over the past few years and the results are good.

          <p eId="para_542">To be perfectly honest, I could not comment because the prioritisation is based on the assessment of the planners in Cork County Council and where they see their priority settlements. Ultimately, we are working internally. As I mentioned this morning, the Minister has been very clear that he wants small towns and villages and rural settlements to be catered for. We accept that because we understand people need homes.</p>

I understand, because I drink from the tap, that hard water is not going to have an effect on my health, but has Uisce Éireann ever communicated to the Department that we need a grant for water softeners for hard water supplies within the country? Has Uisce Éireann ever communicated that to the Department based on the number of complaints it is receiving?</p>

As that 50,000 capacity is taken up every single year, we need to replace it with something.

          <p eId="para_626">It is an eye-watering figure. Mr. Laffey said maybe some of the non-domestic load use will be pre-treated to reduce it. A big issue is the effluent and untreated sewage that goes into Dublin Bay. It is not just from the treatment plant; adjacent to it is an open pipe that comes from Ailesbury Park and St. Alban's Park. I do not know how familiar Mr. Laffey is with that. It is a very localised area but this has plagued people living in the area for a long time. It is a UNESCO biosphere. It has had no-swim notices for the last six or seven years in a row. What can Irish Water do about those notices and the environmental issues arising in Dublin Bay from the pipes going in from an estate with storm water outflow and from the treatment plant itself?</p>

On the storm water overflows on the networks, we are looking to work with local authorities. We want blue-green infrastructure. We want people to stop hardening their driveways.

          <p eId="para_640">Very few. I do not know of one person. I am not saying there has been no such case, but for the most part it has happened the other way: people have gone back to the local authority and then asked if they can change their minds and come back to us.</p>

          <p eId="para_642">We will engage with them, see if we have a position and if they can come over to us through recruitment, but they have made the decision to go back. Working in water services is a career and people live and work in their communities. For some people, when they move into other sections of the local authority, they lose part of the community involvement they have had. Many local authority people fear they will be relocated to some other area of their county. What is emerging is they are not. We have many operational centres across the country that facilitate people staying and living locally. We want people staying and working in their communities. As people see that, it gives them more confidence to come over to us.</p>

          <p eId="para_643">I understand that. Having been a member of a local authority for six years, I clearly see that it is progressing but it would be remiss of me not to emphasise the frustration felt by huge pockets of the community about who they can hold to account, question or get information from. If you ask the council, the query is often put forward to Uisce Éireann. It is a difficult situation. Hopefully, when that is completed in 2026, that will come to an end and there will be increased communication between communities and the utility.</p>
          <p eId="para_644"> What is the nature of the relationship between Uisce Éireann and the big five? What is the nature of its work with external consultants? What is the level of engagement on design? What roles of third-party consultants did Uisce Éireann avail of in, say, 2024?</p>

          <p eId="para_645">Specific consultancy as required under the code is spelled out in our annual report. The number is, from memory, in the region of €3.5 million and it is spread across the suite of requirements. That is specific consultancy as required under the code, which is where we rely on a specific piece of advice or report from them. It is not just the big four. It is all sorts of technical matters. Given the nature of our organisation, there is a lot of engineering and technical expertise required that is not financial in nature.</p>

          <p eId="para_658">We have strong governance systems overall. Any project that we do is managed very well. From that perspective, we have not had any issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_659"> Within our financial reports, we have a write-down number of €7.4 billion right across our estate of €8.8 billion but that is required under IFRS requirements where we have to do an impairment review annually and then bring it into the financial statements. That was across 40 projects, mainly not ICT related with the exception of one. If I was to say one, it was not even, I would say, an ICT type but was around the modelling of weather data because, obviously, given our nature, we have a huge requirement to understand forecast weather patterns, rainfall, drought conditions, etc. We were using the information that was available from Met Éireann. However, Met Éireann, we believe, is now doing up its system and we are going to get further information. As a result of that, we have paused that project. We have actually written down the cost - it was less than €50,000 - but in the event that we need it down the line, we can go back to it when we understand what information Met Éireann now makes available to us.</p>

          <p eId="para_669">In terms of settlement, there is no absolute drop-dead date with regard to settlements. We forecast on an annual basis what we believe will be settled in the following year. In some cases, they are settled. In some cases, they carry on. There are some legacy cases there since pre-2014, pre our inception, that are still ongoing and we are still going through that. In fairness, we deal very swiftly with a lot of the smaller ones, like, as I said, the 500 insurance claims a year.</p>

I had a very positive engagement a few months ago with Uisce Éireann where they took me through its procurement system and showed me how it manages procurement, tendering and all of its obligations. Given that the C and AG has given it a clear audit opinion, I am not going to be focusing on procurement today. I know it is publishing its purchase orders and operating a transparent and quite comprehensive corporate governance model.</p>
          <p eId="para_671"> What I want to focus on today are maybe some things that are working well for Uisce Éireann. Sometimes we do not often enough look at projects that have done well and I would like to give my first minute to that. I am from Athenry. I have seen the upgrade of the wastewater treatment system there and the extension of our sewage network be quite positive and I know that the Arklow plant was delivered on time and on budget. Could I get maybe a minute on why those projects were able to come in on time and on budget and in how many more projects can we expect to see similar results?</p>

The vast majority of our cost increases are caused by delays - planning delays and judicial reviews - where, basically, inflation just drives the cost of the project up.</p>

          <p eId="para_682">One of the toughest experiences that faced many of my constituents in Galway East this year was during Storm Éowyn at the start of the year. Nobody could have anticipated just how devastating that storm would be, but it showed that there is a massive gap in our resilience and ability to respond to storm events like that, and particularly with a lot of our drinking water plants in north Galway and Roscommon. We had plants that were out for six or seven days. I cannot fault the people on the ground who were working hard to get them back online and I cannot fault the fact that Uisce Éireann had to go and find generators for them. My question is looking to the future. What is the plan if power to a treatment plant or one of our water systems is cut again? Will Uisce Éireann have generators in place the next time this happens? That is an issue that the public want to see serious action on.</p>

          <p eId="para_684">When Storm Éowyn hit, we had a peak of approximately 100,000 people without water because of the lack of electricity supply, but we had 400,000 people getting their water supplied by generator-driven plants, so we had a lot preparedness already built in. It was just that Storm Éowyn was quite exceptional. We have ordered a lot more generators. There are two things with generators; one, is to make the plants generator-ready-----</p>

We have to hard wire them in. That is a big programme we are undertaking at the moment. That will be done. We have also things like in the more remote areas like Galway there are pumping stations, which could be a small thing on the side of the road.

          <p eId="para_689">We have put in permanent generators at an additional 30 sites over the summer months. We have purchased another 80 generators that we have ourselves. We have also worked with suppliers to make sure we have more availability of generators through our frameworks in the event of an incident. We are putting in an additional 300 plug-in points this year.</p>

          <p eId="para_690">I welcome that Uisce Éireann has taken that action to put those generators in place, but it is important to say that the one thing about that storm is that people suffered a lot more going six or seven days without water than electricity. The water really hit people hard. I emphasise that point again. Uisce Éireann should take as much action as it possibly can because it is a worthwhile exercise. It might only happen once a year, but there is a fear that it will become more frequent. If Uisce Éireann takes action, people will be grateful. That we are ready for events like these is the minimum people expect given all we know about climate change.</p>

          <p eId="para_691">Storm Éowyn was a national event. There was a much quicker response to recent storms, such as Storm Amy, because it was more localised. We could move all our stock of generators to one area. Most storm events hit one part of the country and are not national. By having that central stockpile, we can move them to where the need is greatest.</p>

          <p eId="para_692">I want to talk about farmers. Farmers are at risk of losing their nitrates derogation. There is rightly a huge amount of concern. Ireland is one of the only countries left in the European Union that has a derogation. Farmers have been pushed so much over the past few years to their bit for the environment, to contribute and to comply. Is Uisce Éireann doing as much as the farmers?</p>

However, at the start of 2024, a letter was sent out that made it official that Uisce Éireann is responsible for those DPIs in the future. As a result of that, we have gone back out and done more surveys with local authorities.

That being said, when the letter came from the Department we gave an undertaking that we would provide the exact same services as were being provided to DPIs by local authority staff and local authorities prior to us being asked to take them over, in terms of operating and looking after them. If a local authority was de-sludging or taking a tanker-load of waste out of a particular septic tank once a week, then we are still doing that. </p>

          <p eId="para_741">Mr. Laffey said there had been ongoing engagements with the Department and the Minister for the previous two to three months in relation to this. Obviously, with the numbers that have been mentioned around dealing with those legacy cases and the announcement that we will be going down a similar model in terms of development by developers, there is an additional workload for Uisce Éireann. Has there been a commitment to increase budgets? What are the additional needs, both in terms of finances and in terms of staff complement, to address both the legacy and the new proposals?</p>

The mechanism was that a company would be set up. Every member of the estate would be a member of that company and they would contribute to the ongoing maintenance and upkeep of the wastewater treatment plant.

We have seconded somebody in there for approximately three months. It is setting up. It is starting to understand what the challenges are in delivering housing. We have done a lot of preparatory work involved. We have identified approximately 70 settlements where we believe we have capacity or where we can invest additional money. We are working with the other utilities to make sure that if we invest in an area then the ESB and rail and road have the same capacity, so we are not all working in different areas and delivering different capacities.</p>

          <p eId="para_832">I thank Mr. Gleeson. There is a frustration in terms of Uisce Éireann co-ordinating with local authorities. For example, if a road is to be resurfaced the local authority notifies Uisce Éireann it is about to happen but I have very often seen roads resurfaced where there is a water pipe that has been damaged or has broken several times and clearly needs rehabilitation. However, this is not done before the road is resurfaced. Two months after a road is resurfaced, it is dug up to fix a water main or a burst pipe. Have we improved in this area? There is nothing more frustrating for the general public than seeing a lack of co-ordination between utility companies and local authorities. I would like the take of the witnesses on this.</p>

          <p eId="para_833">We are improving on that. We are setting up a team in the asset management function. As I said earlier we generally decide our rehabilitation of water mains at short notice because it is based on breakages and we have such a large network and our funds are limited. We are going to work with local authorities because, ultimately, if we identify a pipe that needs replacing or it comes to light that a pipe can be replaced at a lesser cost to both bodies and the taxpayer we can do that. What we are doing now is putting all of our projects on a GIS layer and sharing them with the local authorities throughout the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_836">I appreciate that a lot of the funding Uisce Éireann has received needs to be directed towards housing delivery and that this is a top priority. Rehabilitating water mains that constantly burst needs to be a priority as well. Co-ordinating with the local authorities is critically important. If a road has been resurfaced and then Uisce Éireann has to dig it up, there are obligations on it to resurface that road to a high standard. It really is doubling the work.

When we look at water services there was significant underinvestment for many decades in this country and Uisce Éireann has a monumental task before it. It is appreciated and acknowledged. There are issues we have to quiz at the committee but the scale of the challenge before Uisce Éireann needs to be noted also. I thank the witnesses for their work.</p>

          <p eId="para_844">There are probably three mechanisms we are going to use, which are complementary. We are looking at what we call free treatment. If we have a project to upgrade a wastewater treatment plant in the pipeline, pardon the pun, we will allow developers to treat their own waste to a certain standard on site and we will accept it. When the plant is upgraded, we will ask them to decommission their on-site wastewater treatment systems.</p>
          <p eId="para_845"> The second mechanism has come out recently. In cases under 100 PE, we can work with developers for stand-alone solutions that we would take in charge and operate at public expense.</p>
          <p eId="para_846"> We are considering a third mechanism. It is a piece of work that will take a while. We are considering modular solutions that can be fabricated off-site, in a factory-style setting, and we can produce units up to 1,000 PE that we can simply install next to an existing public wastewater treatment plant.</p>

It is something I see when I deal with pricing at local authority level when dealing with tenders. Is Uisce Éireann instructed to go with the lowest price? How does it deal with balancing the lowest price, the medium price and delivery?</p>

          <p eId="para_854">When we go to the market for tender, we take the most economically advantageous approach. We would have a contract strategy in place that allows us to have large, medium and small contractors in our system. We have a lot of frameworks there that are designed to allow us to deliver at scale. We are now in our regulatory control 4 process for the next five years, out to 2029. That is where we would have identified contracting solutions. There are a number of large frameworks there. There are a number of other frameworks in our capital space, capital programme and ancillary works. Depending on the nature of the work we are doing for large capital projects, we will still go out to the market. It is important to us that the technical capability is there. Depending on the work being done, we will determine what percentage is associated with those requirements and what piece is associated with cost.</p>

          <p eId="para_859">That is exactly right. It would be quicker. May I ask one more question? I am relating the situation to scenarios I have experience of. There is an issue that comes up quite a lot in Leixlip. I alluded to the bursts we have had and I only use this example because it is my hometown and first port of call. Burst pipes always happen at 7 p.m. on a Friday or Saturday, to make things worse. I am sometimes on site. If someone tells me, I go out and see the pipes bursting. You wait for the lads to come and dig and there is a process. Typically, water is not restored until the next morning. Are we happy that we are so reliant on third-party workers for that? I am fearful at 7 p.m. because how do we know those lads have not gone home? By definition, they should have. We need crews available to dig out through the night. As importantly, I always found when I was a councillor, and it is still the case now I am a TD, that it was me who was putting the information into the local Facebook group. At 11 p.m., I am writing posts to tell people where we are. It is instant communication. I presume all the other local representatives are in the same situation. It is the same event, but critical work needs to be done. Are we happy that we have people to do it? How can we improve our communication and get the communication out there? Ultimately, that is the thing that drives people mad. Sometimes we have a gap. We find a similar gap in local authorities. Uisce Éireann knows that running water is the thing, especially for those with children, vulnerable people and the elderly. People like me can call over to someone else who has water but vulnerable people cannot do so.</p>

          <p eId="para_864"> With regard to the communication, that is a matter we are continuously trying to improve to get immediate updates back from the field. Part of our transformation programme is to roll out handheld units to all our water network operators so that on locating and investigating a burst, they can provide information from the field. That will go through automatically to our contact centre, which will then send text messages to all customers in the area, as well as notifications to TDs, to the effect that there is a burst in a particular location. We know we have to improve that communication trail from the field and it is something we will be working to improve.</p>

          <p eId="para_879">Perhaps it is not something that has previously come to Mr. Gleeson's desk. I genuinely mean this to be helpful. Ms Attridge said earlier that Irish Water has changed its public representative system and she hopes public representatives are feeling the change. I do not think they are. I do not know if Irish Water has asked public representatives. My dealings with Irish Water, first as a councillor and now as a TD, have proved challenging. I am not here to lambast its representatives about it, but I do not think Irish Water's systems function the way we, as public representatives, operate, either at a council level or a TD level.</p>
          <p eId="para_880">Those of us who can work hard find the official we might have a relationship with in the local authority who is talking to Irish Water, who can very often solve the problem for us, or we might know someone in Irish Water. It's all very higgledy-piggledy, whereas if Uisce Éireann were subject to parliamentary questions, Members throughout the Dáil would be able to just simply submit that question, which would be referred from the line Minister, and it would have to reply in ten days, in the same way the HSE and NTA do.

Sometimes, the system does not work but, sometimes, you do not like the answer. There is a difference in how we do it. We will try to improve the LRSD system. I think that would be far more effective. As I said, there are 13,000 queries every year on that system, so some of it has got to be working.

          <p eId="para_882">No. Unfortunately, Uisce Éireann would keep both open, from my experience of those systems. I do not know what it is. It is probably due to the legal requirement on the Minister, but you get a better reply there. That is just the reality to things. I wanted to ask those questions and I have got the answers.

There are loads of areas where you can have delays, but if we are talking specifically, if the developer has his connection agreement, has it signed off, and the estate is ready to be connected, I do not believe there are huge delays in that process. There are issues where the developer has come to us late with the connection and we are trying to play catch-up, but I do not think it is a fundamental issue.

We were delighted, obviously, to get planning in the summer. That came with a number of new conditions, so the team are working through those at the moment in terms of what that means for the project estimate. As Mr. Gleeson said, we were judicially reviewed subsequent to that. We are waiting to understand the implications of that. We are pulling together a revised estimate looking at a number of contingencies. There are a lot of moving parts at the minute. We are hopeful that we are going to get a positive outcome out of the court case in December, or possibly in the new year. We will then make a submission to the Government to proceed with our procurement.</p>

There was one really frustrating case at Corke Abbey, a pumping station that, unfortunately, I had been reporting over a three-day period at Christmas time before action was taken.

We are currently looking at about a thousand plants around the country, but we will roll that out to plants, to pumping stations, to everything. Right now we do not have great visibility of a lot of these. We do not have the telemetry. While the EPA says it is easy to fix, I am not sure. We need to get telemetry. Every single pump and every single station needs to be reporting back into that national control centre so we have the oversight in order that when there are equipment failures or where the operator maybe has not done something, we will be alerted straight away back in the control centre and be able to react.</p>

          <p eId="para_949">My final question is about a parochial issue. It relates to two sewage treatment plants in Wicklow, one being the Murrough in Wicklow town and the other being in Greystones. I have, unfortunately, had to go down the route of referring them to the EPA because of serious ongoing issues in terms of severe levels of really bad odours, above and beyond what would be expected. The EPA has carried out site investigations. Uisce Éireann has told me that both plants are on a list, there are different pieces of work going on and they need to be upgraded in terms of the odour abatement systems. I have been told it will be potentially next year before this happens. I do not know whether you would have any specific information in relation to those. They have been going on now for a number of years in terms of the negative experience, not just in Greystones, a highly residential area, but also in the Murrough, which is an area of high public amenity and a special area of conservation. Is there any clarity or any assurance that can be given to people in those areas that we are not going to experience the same levels of serious failures within those two plants and that the upgrades will actually take place?</p>

          <p eId="para_950">I will take that. On the Murrough pumping station, since quarter 1 of 2025, we have been surveying that just to track the odour levels at the treatment plant. The plant is operating within the original design capacity. However, there are upgrade works that can be done to improve it. As regards those upgrade works, following the survey, we have identified the capability of the pumping station to deal with it. Those upgrade works will commence in quarter 1 of 2026 for the Murrough. For Greystones, what was needed there was just some upgrade works, that is, the capacity is okay but it just needed some maintenance works carried out. Some of that work has been progressed and we have seen a notable reduction in odours for quarter 2 and quarter 3 in 2025. We will continue to monitor it. We are also working back through the network. Our source control team is looking at what is discharging into the network that is contributing to the odours.</p>

There was actually repayment of €460 million. The net borrowing in the year was €184 million, and that effectively exhausts the full borrowing capacity there. That is just for the record.</p>

          <p eId="para_953">That is a clarification. Okay. That concludes our engagement today with Uisce Éireann. I thank the chief executive officer and his officials for attending our hearing. I also thank the officials from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the C and AG for their attendance once again. Is it agreed that the clerk seek any follow-up information and carry out agreed actions arising from the meeting? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_954"> The committee is now adjourned until Thursday, 13 November 2025, at 9.30 a.m., when we will engage with the Department of Transport. Go raibh míle maith agaibh.</p>

One of the schemes does not have a similar statutory guarantee of provision of the funding. The value of the liabilities in respect of that scheme is approximately €144 million. That is an estimate. That puts Fáilte Ireland into a net liabilities position on its balance sheet. However, it takes the view that it will be able to meet the liabilities. In a way, it is a little anomalous. It expects it will get the funding but does not treat it as a receivable into the future. Almost all other State bodies that are in a similar funding position assume that they will get the funding into the future and, therefore, recognise an asset. This is an anomalous accounting position. Fáilte Ireland's position is not different."

The correspondent contests a statement made at the meeting by the CEO of the Charities Regulator. When asked how the Charities Regulator became aware of issues at the Peter McVerry Trust, the CEO of the Charities Regulator stated that it first became aware of the issue by way of letter in July 2023 stating, “The letter referred to some cash flow difficulties but not beyond normal ranges and there was nothing to worry about, etc.” At the meeting of 17 October, it was confirmed that the letter was received from the correspondent, who takes issue with the CEO’s statement that the cash flow difficulties were not beyond normal ranges and there was nothing to worry about. In evidence provided in support of this, the correspondent has submitted a letter to the committee dated 14 July 2023. In the second paragraph of the letter, the correspondent states:",

It is absolutely unacceptable to find ourselves in this position, and I think most of us are pretty furious about that - I certainly am. It almost feels like it has been, in many ways, deliberate to try to avoid the kind of scrutiny this committee would have the opportunity to provide on one of the biggest spends - a set of accounts that are one of the oldest ones we would have looked at. There is a lot of public concern about it. It is completely unacceptable. I regret that I am saying this on the last day I will be in the Dáil and this public accounts committee.

One of the stark things I have seen in my time here is not so much the fact that accounts are not properly scrutinised, because they are, but the fact that when there are glaring examples of wastage of public finances, there is virtually no accountability whatsoever. That is very disappointing. Had somebody told us at the first meeting of the public accounts committee in this Dáil term that, by the end of it, we still would not have a completion date and opening date for the national children’s hospital and we still would not know the final cost of that project, I do not think many members, and certainly people within the public, would have believed them. The fact that is the case is a national scandal. Over the course of this Dáil term, this committee has dealt with a number of blatant examples of wastage. For example, we dealt with a situation where the three leaders of Government, behind closed doors, agreed to apply the highest salary in Europe to a civil servant with no rationale. That is a finding of this and another committee of this Dáil. That has set the standard, in my view, to how public bodies operate and how they feel as to whether they are answerable to the Irish people.",

It is only in a position to do that because of a culture that allows organisations to feel they can avoid scrutiny, even when a Dáil committee with a constitutional right requests them to do that. I absolutely agree with the proposition that we ask the incoming public accounts committee to further this issue. I hope that the incoming Dáil and Government will finally, once and for all, ensure that every public body that has ownership of moneys that ultimately belong to the Irish taxpayer is accountable and answerable for wastage of that money. I hope the incoming Dáil finally brings an end to what has been a blatant and disgraceful wastage money and a lack of accountability.",

I thank her for an incredible length of service to this Dáil and in particular to the Committee of Public Accounts. One can only highlight the number of issues on which she has given huge public service – big projects have come under huge public scrutiny that perhaps would not have without her work.

It is incredibly frustrating. It was good that we all worked together on this matter. We all spoke with the one voice from the same hymn sheet. Incredibly important work is done here. We need to make sure the public accounts committee, no matter who is on it, can continue the work that has been done up to now and that we continue to work together and make sure public bodies and whoever spends public money comes in front of this committee in order that we can do the work we have been tasked to do.",
                "It has been agreed that the secretariat will write to the next committee and urge it to consider this particular item regarding the national children’s hospital. It will be an extremely important piece of work. We do not know when this hospital is due to be ready for action. God knows at this stage what the final price will be. Unless members have any further comments on this matter, that concludes our consideration."

                    "The various grants the Government has made available to support small businesses are extraordinarily welcome and very important. The increased cost of business grant and the power up grant are the two most recent ones. In every scheme, anomalies will always arise. A number of anomalies has arisen here, which I want to draw attention to this morning, and that I ask the Minister of State and the Department to look at. One is the issue whereby a business is running an operation in a property but it is renting the property and the property owner is paying the tax. This happens because sometimes property owners were left with the rates bill in the past if the business was not paying the rates. The arrangements were made in many cases where the rates cost would be included in the rental cost, and the landlord would pay the rates and would ensure that it was paid. What has happened now is, because the business itself is not paying the rates, it is deemed ineligible for the power up grant and the increased cost of business grant. That is quite unfair.",
                    "I have been looking through some of the documentation the Department has put together. In fairness to the Department and the Government, they have done great work in this particular area. The Minister, Deputy Peter Burke, stated that \"the priority has been to ensure that as many businesses as possible\" in the hospitality and retail sectors that are facing great difficulty due to increased costs of running a business \"receive the money as quickly as possible\". However, these particular small businesses are now excluded. Another frequently asked question is who is eligible for the grant. The eligibility criteria states: \"Your business must be a commercially ... [traded entity] currently operating from a property that is commercially rateable.\" If the rates are being paid, even indirectly, I contend that we can find a mechanism whereby the business can actually receive the grant and it can be kept in business and keep people employed. It should not be beyond the bounds of possibility to do that.",
                    "Other issues have arisen as well. Somebody applied for the increased cost of business grant and did not tick the fact he or she was a retailer. The person might be a retailer anyway, but, for example, if the person was involved in art or something else instead, if he or she goes for the power up grant, the algorithm in the computer the person applied through will not allow him or her go any further and he or she is stopped. The person contacts the local authority, which says it cannot talk about that as it is a Department issue, but there is no one to talk to. There is a number of business owners around the country doing the best they could, were honest and straightforward and did not tick the correct box the first time and now cannot go forward for the power up grant. Again, I ask the Minister, and the Department, if it is listening, to have a look at that and see if there is a way of actually sorting that out.",
                    "A third anomaly is if somebody was in a rateable property and rates were being paid, and the person moved to a different property during the course of this particular grant being administered. The person is paying rates on the second property as well. That person also cannot draw down the power up grant because he or she moved properties and the property he or she is in now is different. The person has not had the time involved in paying rates through that property in 2023 to claim it back. The ratepayer needs to talk a person, not a computer, in order to fix that. It is unfair on the people if they have paid the rates and did everything upfront, lawfully and so on. I ask that it be looked at and fixed.",
                    "The final issue is slightly unrelated to the point this morning is that the Government has also made grants available for businesses to put solar panels on the roofs of its properties to cut down the cost of electricity. If the property is rented, the landlord or property owner cannot apply because he is not the business owner, and the business owner cannot apply because he does not own the premises. Again, there is a lacuna or anomaly there where nobody wins. Perhaps the Minister of State can shed some light on this."

                    "As Deputy Stanton is aware, the power up grant scheme was announced in the budget to deliver a grant of €4,000 to eligible businesses right around the country. The scheme follows the success of the increased cost of business, ICOB, scheme which has paid out more than €244 million to 75,000 SMEs, including 39,000 SMEs in the retail and hospitality sector. The power up grant was introduced in recognition of the difficulties that businesses in the retail and hospitality sector continue to face. Businesses in those sectors that received a second grant under the ICOB scheme are in line to receive an energy grant of €4,000 under power up. Local authorities that are administering the scheme have emailed relevant businesses in the hospitality and retail sectors that received the second ICOB payment with information on how to register. In order to get payments to businesses before the end of the year, the registration period is short, so I would urge eligible businesses to register before the 8 November deadline.",
                    "Deputy Stanton specifically asked about landlord and tenants, and the Minister, Deputy Burke, has informed me that the criteria for the power up grant are aligned with the increased cost of business scheme. Businesses that are tenants and received the second payment under the increased cost of business scheme can register as long as they are ratepayers. A tenant who pays his or her rates to the landlord, who then pays the local authority, is not eligible. The person running the business must be the ratepayer. While the Minister is aware that some businesses have entered into arrangements with their landlords whereby the landlord pays the rates for his or her tenants, the legal position is that tenants whose rent incorporates their rates obligation, which is remitted by the landlord, cannot be deemed to be ratepayers.",
                    "The Minister recognises the issues the Deputy has raised, however, as stated, there are legal reasons for not including tenants who pay rates through their landlord. The Deputy will appreciate that it would be inappropriate and potentially counterproductive for the Minister to attempt to interfere with existing commercial arrangements between small businesses and their landlords in the context of any business grant scheme. The priority has been and continues to be to ensure that as many businesses as possible in the hospitality and retail sectors, which are facing great difficulties due to the increased costs associated with running a business, receive the money as quickly as possible. Again, I urge businesses which received the second ICOB grant to register by 8 November. Businesses that are having difficulty registering should contact their local authority directly."

                    "I thank the Minister of State for his response. I understand exactly what is being said here, but I will quote to the Minister of State from the frequently asked questions on the Department website. Under the question \"What is the eligibility for the grant?\" the response states that: \"Your business must be a commercially trading entity currently operating from a property that is commercial rateable.\" It does not say that the business owner has to be paying the rates. The rates are being paid. I understand the criteria to encourage people to pay rates and acknowledge people who actually pay rates, but these people have been paying their rates albeit indirectly, and now they are being penalised massively because of it. I ask and plead with the Department officials, who I know are listening to this debate this morning, to find a way so that if the rates have been paid, the grant is allowed to be paid to the business owner who is struggling. It should not be beyond the bounds of human ingenuity to allow that to happen.",
                    "There is another issue I wish to bring up with the Minister of State and Department this morning. In some instances, people did not for whatever reason apply for the increased cost of business, ICOB, grant. They forgot about it and did not do it or were away and missed the deadline. I understand they also now cannot apply for the power-up grant because part of the criteria is that they must have received a second payment of the ICOB. Again, it should not be beyond the bounds of possibility for the Department to find a way to allow these people to actually do that. The date of 8 November is a tight deadline. Perhaps one thing to do would be to move that and give it another week.",
                    "It is hugely important that the Department has some kind of helpline so people can ring up if they run into these blockages. The local authorities are saying it is not their problem and that they are only administering the scheme. There is nobody to talk to, however. The Department could have a helpline people could ring to talk to a human and say they have a problem they wish to discuss to find a resolution. Getting back to my main point, however, if the rates have been paid honestly, fairly and upfront, even though it is indirectly, surely we can find a way to make the money available to the business that actually made the money available, even though it was done through the landlord."

Tagann na mílte turasóirí as chuile chearn den domhan. Má théann tú go dtí an céibh i gCill Rónáin, feiceann tú daoine ón tSeapáin, ó Mheiriceá, ó chuile thír san Eoraip agus mar sin de. Tá Dún Aonghasa tábhachtach ní hamháin go náisiúnta, ach go hidirnáisiúnta. Tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach i gceantar an iarthair ó thaobh na turasóireachta de. Ar ndóigh, tá go leor daoine ag brath ar Dhún Aonghasa mar shlí bheatha ar an oileán leis na busanna, na capaill agus carranna agus mar sin de. Tá an dún mar a bhí riamh. Fág mar sin é. Tá Cill Mhuirbhigh cúpla míle siar ó Chill Rónáin agus, i gCill Mhuirbhigh, bíonn tranglam tráchta chuile lá. Níl áiseanna páirceála ag Oifig na nOibreacha Poiblí ann don dún. Bíonn idir bhusanna, dhaoine a bhíonn ag siúl, dhaoine a bhíonn ar na rothair, na capaill agus trapanna agus dhaoine a thagann i gcarranna, daoine as an áit nó atá ag obair ann agus mar sin de, ann. Bíonn siad ar fad trína chéile. Níl sé sábháilte. Is fada atáimid ag caint air seo ach is beag atá déanta. Ní mór tuilleadh talún a fháil agus carrchlós ceart a thógáil chun go bhféadfaí cionroinnt a dhéanamh idir na haicmí éagsúla, na rothair, na capaill, na busanna agus na carranna, chun go mbeadh gach duine sábháilte. Tá gá le háiseanna níos fearr freisin. Ba cheart breathnú air seo mar rud náisiúnta. Tá geallúintí faighte thar na blianta. Mar sin, bheadh súil agam go mbeidh sé scríofa san fhreagra atá ag an Aire Stáit go ndéanfar rud éigin faoin gceist seo, go bhfuil sé idir lámha go gníomhach faoi dheireadh agus go gcuirfear deireadh leis an scannal agus contúirt atá ann ar an láthair seo."

The site marks the entry point to the reserved pedestrian route. Tá sé sin ciliméadar amháin ón suíomh ársa é féin. Mar is eol do chách, seasann an suíomh sin ar an aill álainn sin, ag féachaint amach ar an bhfarraige. Tá Dún Aonghasa 3,000 bliana d'aois. Is é an dún is mó agus is tábhachtaí ar an gcósta Atlantaigh. Taispeánann an dún stair sheandálaíochta an tréimhse réamhstairiúil. Tagann na struchtúir is luaithe ó 1,100 RCh. Bhí 144,000 cuairteoir ann in 2023. Is méadú mór é sin ó 2021 agus 2022. Tá an t-ionad cuairteora oscailte thar na blianta. Gan dabht, uaireanta bíonn sé dúnta de bharr na haimsire. Aontaím leis an Teachta. Caithfear dul chun cinn a dhéanamh ar na háiseanna atá ann ag an ionad. Mar fhreagra air seo, tá maoiniú faighte ag an OPW ó Fáilte Ireland do na hoibreacha caipitil atá de dhíth. Mar is eol dúinn, tá togra ar an suíomh faoi láthair. Tá súil againn go gcríochnófar é sin roimh dheireadh mí an Mheithimh 2025. The project will be delivered as part of the OPW, Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage and Fáilte Ireland capital investment programme. Rinneadh tograí eile sa bhealach seo, mar shampla, an t-ionad cuairteora ar na Blascaodaí agus an ceann ar na Céide Fields i gContae Mhaigh Eo. I will stop doing the live translation because I am not trained in it."

There is a need to refresh the visitor experience. The interpretative exhibition at the centre has not been upgraded in many years and needs to be renewed. There is a need to address the requirement of visitor information and exhibitions relating to a large number of the other national monuments on the three Aran Islands both in terms of static provision and online information.

Is í an áit a bhfuil an chontúirt agus an fhadhb ná leis an bpáirceáil. An féidir leis an Aire Stáit a shamhlú, ó tharla gurb as Contae na Mí dó, mura mbeadh aon pháirceáil ag an OPW ag Brú na Bóinne? An féidir leis a shamhlú go gcaithfí páirceáil ar an tsráid agus go mbeadh cóistí capall, rothair – tá an t-uafás daoine ar na hOileáin Árainn ar rothar, mar is eol dó - agus go leor busanna ann? Is é seo an rud is gá díriú air. Ba mhaith liom a bheith dearfach agus breathnú an bhfuil féidearthacht le réiteach éasca a fháil air seo. Ba mhaith liom go rachadh an tAire Stáit ar ais chuig a Roinn le fáil amach cén fáth nach suíonn an OPW síos leis an gcomhairle contae agus leis an Roinn Forbartha Tuaithe agus Pobail le féachaint an bhféadfadh siad iarratas a dhéanamh faoin ciste RRDF leis an bhfadhb fhadtéarmach seo a réiteach, talamh breise a fháil agus a cheannach, agus ansin dul ar aghaidh agus forbairt a dhéanamh ar na háiseanna páirceála ansin. D’athródh sé sin chuile shórt. Chonaic muid nuair a rinne muid an cé in Inis Mór. Bhí sé ina sciob sceab ar an gcé go dtí gur tógadh an cé nua. Anois, tá sé an-eagraithe agus sábháilte agus tá áit do chuile shórt ar an gcé. Is é seo an rud céanna a theastaíonn anois anseo. Nach iontach an rud é go bhfuil 144,000 duine ag dul amach ann? Caithfidh muid cuimhneamh ar rud amháin, is é sin, go bhfuil muid ag iarraidh go gcuirfear scéal maith amach gur áit iontach le dul é, le háiseanna thar cinn, agus ar ndóigh, go bhfuil Dún Aonghusa mar a bhí sé riamh, le lámh leagtha air agus é ann don phobal."

Is bóthar náisiúnta é agus tá polasaí ag TII nár chóir go mbeadh cead pleanála tugtha d’aon duine le teach aonair a thógáil atá ag teacht amach ar an bhealach sin. Is fadhb mhór í sin mar téann an bóthar seo ó bhaile Dhún na nGall fríd go dtí Tamhnach an tSalainn suas go dtí Ard an Rátha agus na Gleannta fríd an Clochán Liath agus isteach go Gaoth Dobhair, thart ar An Craoslach agus amach go Leitir Ceanainn.

It is an issue that we have raised on many occasions down through the years and there is huge frustration in Donegal that this issue is still not dealt with. It is the national policy which restricts the one-off building of homes accessing the N56 national secondary road.",

It stretches from Donegal town, clockwise, right through Letterkenny, and it passes through towns such as Mountcharles, Ardara and Glenties, up through Dungloe, Falcarragh, out to Dunfanaghy and Creeslough, through Kilmacrennan until it reaches Letterkenny again. It is the spine of Donegal.",

Over the years, they have found it increasingly difficult to do that because of this national policy, which prevents the building of homes that lead onto the N56.",
                    "This has resulted in children of people who have contacted me not being able to return home from Australia. In particular, it has resulted in some cases of people who have gone to Australia because they cannot get build in their own county. It has resulted in huge financial issues for others because the land that they have, their family land, is sterilised for the purpose of housing and they have to fork out €50,000, €60,000 or more for a site.",
                    "Cuireann sé seo brú fosta ar cheantair Ghaeltachta. Mar a dúirt mé, is é seo an ceantar Gaeltachta is mó sa tír. Téann an bealach seo fríd an cheantar seo agus níl cead ag daoine cead pleanála a fháil fá choinne tithe aonaracha ar an bhealach seo agus cuireann sé sin brú mór ar theaghlaigh atá ag iarraidh clann a thógáil le Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht. Tá ar chuid acu an Ghaeltacht a fhágáil.",
                    "As the Minister of State will be aware, the reducing of speed limits across the N56 was announced recently in legislation. All secondary roads will see the speed limits reduced. This potentially has the possibility to open the door for this national policy to be reviewed, especially in light of the impact that it is having in Donegal. Housing being permitted on an appropriate and limited basis on adjacent roads to the N56 should be permitted now. Cars going slower along these roads make them safer and allow appropriate houses to be built on adjacent roads. I am asking the Minister of State to engage with Transport Infrastructure Ireland and ask it to have this policy reviewed considering the impact it is having on Donegal.",
                    "The issue of planning stands on its own two feet. This is not an issue of planning. The Donegal County Council planners, in the main, on many of these occasions have no issue with the houses being built there. The roads section of the county look at the braking distance and the vision lines and those are also being satisfied, but there is a blanket policy within TII which basically says that if you are on the N56 or, indeed, if you are coming out onto the N56, you are not getting planning. It is heartbreaking. It needs to stop. It needs to change and I believe the change in policy, in terms of speed limits, gives us that opportunity to do so."

                    "In September 2023, the Department of Transport published a speed limit review. This review made key recommendations that the default speed limit on national secondary roads should be reduced from 100 km/h to 80 km/h, on local roads from 80 km/h to 60 km/h and on roads in built-up areas from 50 km/h to 30 km/h. These changes were legislated for in the Road Traffic Act 2024, signed into law in April.",
                    "The Deputy will recall that national legislation sets default speed limits for different classes of roads but the final decision will be with local authorities, who can leave them at the default or apply different limits through so-called \"special speed limit\" bye-laws. This is quite right, because it is the local councillors and local authorities who are best placed to assess the characteristics of each road and apply the appropriate limits, in light of safety and traffic management considerations.",
                    "Implementing the changes requires local authorities to review the roads in each of the three classes affected and to consider whether the new default or another limit may be appropriate. This is a large task, and therefore the implementation of the changes is being undertaken in phases, with local roads being treated first. The Department has worked closely with the local authorities towards implementation, and has issued new guidelines to assist them.",
                    "In light of the complexity of the work, the Department has agreed that the new local default limit, originally intended to come into effect in late November, will now take effect from early February.",
                    "Changes to national secondary road speed limits and speed limits on roads in built-up areas will be dealt with after this is completed.",
                    "The Deputy has particularly raised the question of developments along national secondary roads. Luann sé ceantair Ghaeltachta go háirithe maidir leis an N56. TII and the local authorities engage on the setting of speed limits on national secondary roads, with TII having the final say. I expect that the Deputy is considering what the relationship would be between new developments and possible speed limits. We can all imagine scenarios where a new development beside a road will lead to significant increase in traffic, and that will impact on the appropriate speed limit. It might well be necessary to reduce a speed limit in cases of a new development, either because it was actually being built or because it was planned. I assure him that in these cases TIl and the local authorities engage closely in ensuring that the proposed speed limit alterations are appropriate. Formal requests for consent for the making of special speed limit by-laws involve a public consultation phase and are processed by TIl on an ongoing basis. Speed limits are designed to be appropriate to current road requirements, including traffic levels, and can be changed if these requirements change. Local authorities can change the speed limits to fit new developments, and speed limits which may currently exist do not act as a barrier to future developments."

There are TDs across different political divides who raised this issue with the National Roads Authority before it was subsumed into TII. The authorities are not budging. There is a blanket policy here. I understand the rationale for some of it in terms of road safety but we have planners and road sections of the planning division where they look at braking distance and vision lines and decide whether it is safe and appropriate for a house to be built in that area, allowing for access onto a road. TII takes a completely uncompromising approach, which says if a development is coming onto the N56, which is the spine of Donegal, it is not allowed planning. It is sterilising land right across the area. We have major issues with depopulation. I believe in vibrancy in our rural communities and our Gaeltacht communities. I want to see young people being able to build on their own land. We have a policy at national level that is frustrating that and causing serious damage. I am asking Government to reach out to TII and to say that it needs to review its policy. This blanket, sledge-hammer approach is not fair to the people of Donegal. Of course, road safety has to be at the heart of it. We know in Donegal how many people have lost their lives on the road, without a doubt, but blanket approach to this policy is not acceptable.",
                    "Back in July, Donegal County Council submitted a proposal to enable what it described as the continued survival of our rural and Gaeltacht communities to TII, to allow where necessary appropriate and limited access to the N56 in respect of planning permissions. TII is not listening. We do have a change in terms of speed limits but that is a separate issue. What we need is a change in policy, a more appropriate policy in respect of TII. It is not acceptable where the whole west and south of County Donegal is serviced by this main road and proximity to the main road does not allow people to build on their own land. It has to stop. Will the Minister of State intervene with TII today?"

The speed limit issue has been dealt with and the local authority and local councillor colleagues of the Deputy can engage with TII. An allocation of almost €30 million was provided to Donegal County Council for national roads in 2024. There are six major projects in the county, including Dungloe to Glenties and Mountcharles to Inver on the N56. There has been a lot of investment in roads in Donegal. We want to make sure those roads are safe. I agree with the Deputy.

                "We bring forward this motion with no joy or satisfaction. It is with a heavy heart and an unshakeable sense of duty that we confront what is unfolding before us and what we see very clearly in Gaza, namely, a genocide that is happening in real time. Recognising genocide in this House is a grave responsibility, but it is also a necessity. Such recognition removes from any grounds on which future generations might look back and say they did not know. We cannot allow history to ask why we were content with being the very least bad when it came to action to prevent genocide and call it out. We must speak with clarity and conscience, standing firm in our commitments to condemn this atrocity, but also do all within our power to stop it.",
                "As we consider this motion, I acknowledge with respect and sorrow the historical suffering of the Jewish people, victims of humanity's crime, genocide. So too do I acknowledge those victims of the Armenian genocide, the Rwandan genocide, the Srebrenica genocide and all the atrocities of the 20th and 21st centuries on which all of us looked back and said \"never again\". They endured horrors no human should ever face and systematic attempts to annihilate them that led the world to establish international institutions aimed at ensuring that such war crimes could never happen again. Those institutions are crumbling at the moment because of the indifference. When we were taught \"never again\", we committed that those words would hold true for all of humanity, no matter the oppressor, no matter the victim.",
                "Today, it is precisely that commitment that compels us to act. What we are witnessing in Gaza is the systematic destruction of a people. Since Israel began its invasion more than 12 months ago, in excess of 150,000 Palestinians have been either killed or wounded. Among them, over 43,000 have been confirmed dead, two thirds of whom are women or children. Israeli missiles have levelled hospitals, schools, universities, UN facilities, refugee camps, bakeries, bread mills, farms and places of worship. Critical infrastructure for sanitation, water and communication lies in ruins. As we speak, 90% of Gaza's population has been displaced and 70% of its buildings have been destroyed or damaged by Israeli bombs. An Israeli blockade has restricted Gaza's food supply so severely that 83% of the required food aid is blocked from entering, while water production capacity has dropped to just 5% of what is needed. The entire population of Gaza faces food insecurity and the numbers enduring catastrophic hunger are to double imminently to nearly 400,000 people. Just last month, the United Nations released a report documenting Israel's deliberate policy to dismantle Gaza's healthcare system as part of a broader campaign of destruction, identifying these actions as war crimes and crimes against humanity, including extermination. Days later, on 28 October, the Israeli Parliament voted to expel the UN Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA, the main provider of humanitarian aid in Gaza and the occupied territories, from the country within 90 days. These are not isolated actions. They are hallmarks of genocide.",
                "The Tánaiste, Deputy Micheál Martin, has previously condemned, and used the word \"genocide\" to describe, Russia's actions in Ukraine. If he can identify and condemn genocide when it occurs elsewhere, surely he must do so with the same honesty and resolve when it unfolds before our eyes in Gaza. This is not about political alignment or diplomatic posturing. It is about moral integrity and our fundamental human obligations. Ireland ratified the genocide convention in 1976. It sets out clear obligations for states to follow when there is evidence of genocide. Under Article 1, all state parties have an obligation not only to punish but to prevent genocide. This is not a passive responsibility. It requires us to actively take measures to halt actions that might contribute to the destruction of a people. Preventing genocide means that when we see evidence of such crimes unfolding, we cannot stand idly by. We must intervene, be that diplomatically or economically and through every legal means available to us.",
                "Over the past year, we in the Social Democrats and others across the Chamber have brought forward a number of parliamentary motions asking for actions. Each time, they have been voted down or have been passed without any commitment to act. This obligation compels us to suspend any military trade that could support the perpetrators, to revoke dual licences for goods that could have military applications, to restrict the use of Irish airspace and airports for any weapons transfers, and to impose comprehensive trade, travel and diplomatic sanctions. When we signed that convention to prevent genocide, did we really believe that after a year of watching the annihilation of a people, we could point to the fact that while Ireland's voice has been undoubtedly stronger than most, the outcome remains the same? We are not meeting our obligations to prevent genocide, be that through indifference or not knowing. Neither is justifiable.",
                "These actions are not only possible under the genocide convention; they are mandated when evidence of genocide is present. To fail in those obligations is very much to risk being complicit. We can be complicit in many ways, whether through indifference or whereby, when we are told certain actions that are happening in the Irish State are adding to Israel's capacity to annihilate the people of Gaza, we step back, question and equivocate to say that maybe we will act at some point in the future. We say that maybe we cannot act alone and that we have to bring our European partners with us, but at a certain point we have to stand up and do something.",
                "Almost ten months ago, we brought forward a motion setting out actions that included expelling the Israeli ambassador, because we did not believe at that time that we could have normal diplomatic relations with a country so hellbent on annihilating the population of Gaza. We were shot down and told we were naive and did not understand the nuances of diplomacy. Ten months later, Gaza lies in ruins, with children under rubble. I recall a time in this Chamber when we debated whether Israel would actually bomb a hospital. It has now bombed every hospital. There was a time when we talked about whether we should use words such as \"invasion\" or even go further. At this point, not only have 90% of the population of Gaza been displaced; they have been consistently displaced. They have been told to move from northern Gaza to the south and been bombed when they got there. Nothing we have seen over the past year has suggested in any way that this will stop.",
                "Only yesterday, I watched the Tánaiste question the motivations of people who sought to even highlight our difference. I will address some of those disparaging remarks he made about the online publication The Ditch, which has reported on the use of Irish airspace for munitions transfers bound for conflict zones and shared crucial information about US pressure over the occupied territories Bill passing. In a democracy, we cannot ignore or diminish voices that bring difficult truths to light, nor should we attempt to discredit the sources of uncomfortable information based on a perceived political bias. Questioning the political motivations of truth-tellers is a heinous practice. If applied to other media organisations that hold us to account, we would be rightly called out for it. A free press should be inclusive of all voices, especially those who dare to challenge powerful interests and bring uncomfortable facts to the public's attention. The uncomfortable fact in this instance is that through indifference, sovereign Irish airspace is being used to transfer munitions, and that fact only came to light because of the good work of the reporters.",
                "The Irish people, as we know, understand suffering deeply. We remember our history of enforced famine, displacement, oppression and loss. It is our own history of starvation and enforced population decline that gives us a unique moral duty to speak up when we witness such suffering elsewhere. Irish people know the pain, and because of this we are called on to stand with those enduring it now. By not opposing this motion, the Government implicitly recognises the scale and nature of what is happening in Gaza. If the Government will not oppose it, it must accept that genocide is happening and that we have a duty to do all we can to stop it. This moment calls on us to fulfil our commitment to humanity. We must be able to look back with an assurance we did everything within our power to recognise, prevent and condemn the genocide and to seek action we believe can enforce consequences on the State of Israel to stop its barbarity in Gaza and the Palestinian lands.",
                "By affirming this motion, we declare that we will not be silent and, beyond that, that we will act, because we have obligations to prevent genocide. Our voice has been strong and we have stood in a world that has increasingly looked away from the suffering, but we can go further. Israel needs to feel consequences now. Ours is a small nation but a proud one, and when we take a stand, others follow. Even this parliamentary recognition of genocide today is not going to do much to stop the suffering that people are experiencing in Gaza, but it can allow us to go further and take a stand to say we did everything we could and were not complicit."

We still maintain normal diplomatic relations with Israel. We still maintain normal travel relations with Israel. We have actually increased our trade in dual-use technology with Israel. We continue to allow military aircraft carrying bombs and munitions to travel through our airports and airspace, and this Government still will not call Israel’s actions what they are.",
                "This is a genocide. There is no doubt. There is no alternative motivation or terminology for Israel’s actions. The Israeli State is doing everything within its power to wipe the Palestinian people and the Palestinian State off the map. It has not made any attempt to hide this. Israel has been relentlessly starving, bombing and maiming the captive civilian population in Gaza and the West Bank, doing everything it possibly can to increase the already astronomical loss of life, doing everything it can to ensure that Palestine becomes entirely uninhabitable for the millions of Palestinians who live there. Hospitals are bombed and sieged, schools and universities reduced to rubble, refugee camps bombed and set alight. Heritage sites and cultural institutions across Gaza have been purposefully and cynically destroyed. An ancient harbour from 800 BC, a mosque that was home to rare manuscripts and one of the world’s oldest Christian monasteries are just a few of the hundreds of cultural sites that Israel has targeted over the last year.",
                "These actions are an attempt not just to wipe out a people but all memory of a people, all evidence of one of the oldest living cultures in human history. These actions constitute genocide, so why will this Government not say as much? Why is it continuing to hide behind the excuse of waiting for an international process to be concluded? Why did it not have any hesitation in using the word “genocide” in relation to Russia’s targeting of civilian infrastructure in Ukraine? What was the difference there? I would have to guess it is the position of America and key European allies. It was easy to call Russia’s actions what they were when our western allies were standing beside us and when everyone was working together to implement an EU sanctions regime. This is different. The European response to the genocide in Palestine has been appalling in its moral hypocrisy. There have been no EU sanctions applied to Israel. Billions in EU trade continues to flow into the Israeli economy, directly funding an apartheid regime, directly funding a genocide. Some countries in the EU take it further, with Germany supplying 30% of Israel’s arms. We need to continue to work on an EU level to suspend EU trade, and I appreciate the Taoiseach’s efforts to progress this. However, how can we be taken seriously in demanding that the EU do everything within its power to take action when we are not willing to do the same?",
                "The occupied territories Bill was first introduced to the Dáil in 2019 by a Fianna Fáil TD but as soon as Fianna Fáil entered government, it disavowed the Bill and said it was unconstitutional. Fine Gael, on the other hand, has always been opposed to the Bill. With just days left in office, the Government admitted the Bill can be enacted but it claims it has run out of time. It is a cynical and transparent excuse. If the Government wanted to pass the occupied territories Bill, it would have. If it was genuine about needing extra time to pass it, it would have accepted our offer to use this time slot, and Sinn Féin’s yesterday, to pass it. Alternatively, it could have kept the Dáil in session until it passed it, as it did for many other pieces of legislation it deemed a priority. It seems the occupied territories Bill is not a priority for this Government, and if it is not a priority in the face of genocide, it never will be.",
                "On Tuesday, The Ditch published some very concerning information. The US ambassador to Ireland contacted the Government last month to warn about “consequences” if the occupied territories Bill were enacted. Apparently, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste’s office were warned about the “economic uncertainty” it would cause for some 1,000 US businesses based here. This stems from a US law that prohibits companies from complying with unsanctioned foreign boycotts. The ambassador then offered to connect the Attorney General and Government enterprise teams with “relevant offices in Washington” for “discussions to ensure the best outcome” for the legislation. The Government has still not clarified whether the Attorney General, or any other Government official or Minister, contacted counterparts in the United States to get advice on this. It has still not answered the crucial question: is this the real reason it is refusing to enact this legislation? Is the Government refusing to implement domestic legislation because it is more concerned about a backlash from the United States - Israel’s largest arms dealer - than the genocide unfolding before our eyes? If this is the cowardice shown by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party when faced with resistance from the Biden Administration, why would we have any faith they will take a stronger stance against a more hostile and vindictive administration under Donald Trump?",
                "This is legislation the public are demanding in their thousands every week on the streets. They want to see the occupied territories Bill enacted now. We cannot wait until all our allies are lined up beside us before we act because the Palestinian people do not have the luxury of time. We have a legal responsibility under the Genocide Convention to do everything in our power to stop genocide. Instead, we are nearly facilitating it. We know Shannon Airport and Irish airspace are being used to transport bombs and weapons to Israel. We know this not from the Minister for Transport, not as the result of any inspections of military planes in Shannon, but from investigative work by The Ditch. Since these issues have been made public, the Government does not seem to have taken any action at all to prevent further flights. Countries and airlines are trampling over our neutrality and sovereignty because it is convenient for them, because cutting through our airspace means a smaller fuel bill and, crucially, because they know there will be no consequences. They know this Government will look the other way because it always has.",
                "This position is not credible and it never has been. We cannot, as a state, claim to be militarily neutral when we are facilitating the passage of weapons through Ireland. By failing to act to prevent this, the Government is ensuring that Ireland is complicit in the slaughter of the Palestinian people, complicit in a genocide this Government refuses to name. Enough is enough. For 75 years, there has been no accountability for the crimes committed by Israel against the Palestinian people, for the denial of their basic rights, the seizure of land and all of the brutal injustices of an apartheid government. We must take every action we can as a state to ensure that Israel is held accountable. Symbolic gestures are valuable and have meaning, but we can do more than that. Ireland can suspend trade, travel and diplomatic relations. Ireland can end the use of Shannon Airport by the US military. Ireland can stop the export of dual-use goods to Israel. We can call this horror out for what it is: a genocide of the Palestinian people. However, at every opportunity, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have failed to take action. If they have not acted to date, why on earth would anyone believe they will do it in the future?"

                "I welcome the opportunity to address the situation in Gaza, which remains an issue of profound concern and horror for the Government, this House and the people of Ireland. It is now over 12 months since this House adopted a motion in the aftermath of the attacks perpetrated by Hamas and other terrorist groups against Israel on 7 October 2023. At that time, we unreservedly condemned these brutal attacks, which indiscriminately and systematically targeted civilians, resulting in over 1,200 deaths. We called for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages. The Dáil called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and for immediate and unimpeded humanitarian access to meet the urgent needs of all civilians in Gaza. We underlined that Israel must act within international law, stressing the universal applicability of international law, including international humanitarian law. These priorities have been, and remain, central to the Government’s approach. Our leadership and work with like-minded partners placed these issues at the centre of the EU and UN agenda.",
                "In the 12 months since, the horror and despair have deepened. An agreement on a ceasefire and hostage release deal has not been achieved. There have been over 43,000 more deaths in Gaza alone, where the level of destruction and human suffering is truly horrific and completely unacceptable. Israel’s war on Gaza is beyond any moral compass. We are witnessing the collective punishment of an entire population and the destruction of the entirety of Gaza. In northern Gaza, terrible atrocities are being committed, with the forced removal of the population from that part of Gaza.",
                "I repeat, an immediate ceasefire, the release of all hostages and a surge of humanitarian assistance into Gaza must remain the urgent focus of the international community. While our discussions today are focused on Gaza, we continue to face the risk of even wider regional escalation, which would have devastating consequences for the innocent people of the region as a whole. This is a trajectory that is deeply troubling and must be reversed. Given the gravity of the issue under discussion today, I want to be clear that the Government will continue to pursue policies and initiatives that have a real and meaningful impact on the realities faced by the Palestinian people and take full account of the overall political and legal landscape. Effective leadership on foreign policy issues means bringing others with us and ensuring that our actions have a relevance beyond the domestic sphere. I stand over the Government record in this regard. Our principled position of tireless advocacy and considered actions are appreciated by Palestine and our like-minded partners in Europe and the region. I suggest the Deputy ask Palestinians or the Palestinian Authority their perception of Ireland's stance or even ask the Arab world more generally about the Irish Government's stance. It is a very unequivocal, positive one and they wish that others would do more."

                "As this House is aware, steps are being taken by the Israeli Parliament against UNRWA. These could bring about the collapse of the entire humanitarian response in Gaza, which rests on UNRWA’s infrastructure. The Government is working within the EU, as well as with a core group of like-minded states at the United Nations, to explore all possible political and legal avenues to protect the role played by UNRWA. This is consistent with the Government’s steadfast support for UNRWA in the face of continuing and systematic attacks from the Israeli Government. This political support was further underscored by the immediate provision of an additional €20 million of support for UNRWA earlier this year, announced in the presence of Commissioner General Lazzarini during his visit to Dublin in February. This leadership at a critical juncture had a material impact on the approach of other donors, including the European Union. That is real action which had real impact and changed the direction of travel in Europe towards UNRWA. There is no question about that and Ireland led on it. It was very impactful for the people of Palestine and that has to be acknowledged.",
                "Ireland's recognition of the State of Palestine was a deeply significant moment in our bilateral relations with Palestine and a clear signal to the rest of the world of Ireland’s solidarity at a time of immense despair for the Palestinian people. I already set out the Government’s approach in detail to this House in May. What I wish to underline at this point is that the timing and context of this decision were carefully calibrated with other partners to build momentum behind the Arab peace plan and implementation of the two-state solution. This momentum has continued in recent months, including through the launch of the global alliance for implementation of the two-state solution during UN high-level week last September. This will include several follow-up meetings at senior official level, the first of which took place last week. I stress that our decision to recognise the State of Palestine was a national prerogative, fulfilling a commitment in the programme for Government. However, the Government’s decision was taken to ensure a strategic approach and a meaningful impact on the international landscape.",

As I have stated, the advisory opinion delivered by the International Court of Justice, ICJ, has changed the legal context for the Bill. The Deputy ignored this in her contribution. What has not changed is the EU’s exclusive competence in the field of trade for all its member states, including Ireland. It is against this background that the Taoiseach asked the Attorney General to provide updated advice in relation to this Bill. In light of the new context provided by the advisory opinion, the Government has decided to progress the Bill and to prepare amendments. As I set out to the committee on Tuesday, the amendments required are not merely technical in nature. The Government’s analysis is that substantive amendment will be required to most, if not all, of the Bill’s provisions to try to bring it into line with EU law and our Constitution, while prohibiting imports from the occupied territories. This has been acknowledged by the sponsors of the Bill."

The Government contributed actively to the proceedings through its written submission in July 2023 and the oral submission made by the Attorney General to the court in February of this year. Ireland’s core objective in making submissions in this case was to encourage the court to clarify the rights of the Palestinian people in international law and the opinion of the court largely confirmed the Government’s own legal analysis. Far from using the issue as a domestic political football, the changed legal context that has given rise to further consideration of the occupied territories Bill has emerged from a process supported and shaped by the contributions of this Government.",

We understand that South Africa filed its memorial last week. Israel has until 28 July 2025 to file its counter-memorial.

We are also committed to supporting and promoting a strict interpretation of the Genocide Convention to ensure the highest level of protection possible for civilians caught up in situations of armed conflict, and to apply the highest standards of conduct on those engaged in conflict. At my direction, work is progressing on the preparation of Ireland’s declaration of intervention, with the intention that it will be filed before the end of this year. In formulating this declaration, Ireland will set out a robust basis for its intervention before the court. It will then be a matter for the court to rule on its admissibility. We want to test the Genocide Convention and broaden its interpretation to encompass what is happening in Gaza. That has been a very considered approach by the legal team in my Department.",

This is precisely the same approach followed in our intervention in the case of Ukraine v. Russia. In that instance, provisional measures were ordered by the court in March 2022. Ukraine filed its memorial in July 2022. Ireland made its declaration of intervention in September 2022. In both cases, Ireland has made timely Interventions consistent with the ICJ’s rules. We have done so in a considered manner, having regard to the gravity of the facts at issue in each case and a detailed assessment of the applicable legal standards. This is not only to ensure the success of our arguments, but also to maintain Ireland’s well-earned reputation as a serious and respected voice in support of the international legal order.",

He says he is deeply committed to international law and accountability, but where are the sanctions against Israel that we desperately need now? Why is Irish airspace being used now to facilitate weapons being transported to Israel to kill children? It is fine to say there are policies and regulation in place on dual-use technology but the facts are that dual-use technology from Ireland, made in Ireland and designed in Ireland is being used in munitions and weapons that are killing children, men and women in Gaza. That is what is happening now and it has been happening for the last 12 months.",
                "As the Tánaiste says we will be doing this and doing that, the slaughter continues. We are asking for the Government to act now. The impact is the slaughter of children in Gaza - children who are being killed every day and should have their lives ahead of them with hopes and dreams for the future - children blown to pieces by weapons that have passed through Irish airspace, brutal carpet bombing of residential areas with weapons that have passed through Irish airspace, media workers killed by weapons that passed through Irish airspace, healthcare workers killed and humanitarian relief workers killed. An estimated 10,000 Palestinians are under rubble whose bodies have not even made the official count of the dead in Gaza. Every day in Gaza children are seeing their parents murdered in front of their eyes.",

An entire way of life is being destroyed and some of that is with weapons that have passed through our airspace.",
                "Genocide is taking place in an attempt to eradicate the Palestinian people and there is complicity from Ireland. The Government has not stopped the use of Irish airspace for the transport of weapons. We have not inspected a single plane. Indeed, the Government denied that our Irish airspace was being used until work done by The Ditch showed that was the case. That is complicity in the slaughter and genocide. The dual-use technology, made and designed in Ireland and exported to Israel and used in weapons that slaughter people, is complicity in the slaughter and complicity in the genocide. Ireland has failed to take any economic actions against Israel despite the continuing slaughter of men, women and children. That failure by the Government to act is complicity in the slaughter and complicity in the genocide.",
                "There has been support from the Government to pass the occupied territories Bill. Even though we offered time this week and Sinn Féin offered time, that is not happening. That failure to act is further complicity. The illegal settlements Bill has not been progressed and has been blocked by this Government; that is a failure to act. When we see children in Gaza being orphaned and screaming for the parents they have lost, parents who may have been killed with munitions that went through our airspace, that is complicity in the genocide.",
                "There is overwhelming support from the Irish people for the people of Palestine, the people of Gaza. There is no question of that. The Government has been outspoken when it comes to the rule of law internationally and domestically. However, while the Government has been vocal on this blatant disregard of international law, there has been a complete lack of the sanctions that are absolutely needed on this. Even though the Tánaiste says that it will and should happen at European level, 12 months into this there is no sign of sanctions coming from a European level. Genocide is taking place, as this motion recognises and I welcome that the Government is not opposing it. Where are the sanctions that are needed now? We need the Government to act on this."

There need to be consequences for what is occurring, which cannot be described as a country defending itself. Hospitals, schools, people's homes, universities and places of worship are being reduced to rubble. Gaza is being described as a graveyard for children with thousands slaughtered. Those who have survived are being denied the basics for life. This will be made worse, if that is possible, by making UNRWA illegal.",

The term was established after the Holocaust and was defined in the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. Israel is being supplied with weapons of war primarily by the US but also by some EU member states. By doing so, they are complicit in the genocide. How can we be told that the use of a 500 lb bomb is precise and targeted? How is it that we are watching in real time citizens being used as target practice? What is occurring is an attempt to wipe out the population of Gaza and occupy those lands. Men, women and children - whole families - are being wiped out. Ethnic cleansing of Gaza is the official policy now. No Palestinian will be allowed to live in northern Gaza and it is just moving further and further.",

We are not seeing the sanctions that are needed or any stopping of the supply of weapons in this scenario from countries that we regard as friendly to us. We need to be the voice because the people in Gaza feel they do not have a voice. We must ensure that this slaughter stops."

What will bring an end to the slaughter is the same thing that brings an end to apartheid and repressive and oppressive regimes anywhere else in the world, that is, international pressure. It was international pressure that brought an end to the apartheid regime in South Africa and ensured that the peace process in Ireland took hold and has largely kept hold. It will only be through international pressure that Israel will finally be brought to the point whereby it ends the apartheid, occupation, annexation and ongoing destruction of the Palestinian people.",

In fact, it was so upfront that it quickly managed to get Fianna Fáil and the Green Party to remove it as a manifesto pledge and ensure that it did not form part of the programme for Government. When public pressure came to bear, it then came up with EU law as a rationale. That was not an issue when Fianna Fáil first moved the Bill in this House.

We should not allow companies based in Ireland to export any dual-use item that could have a military use by the Israel Defense Forces. It is simple. We should end the illegal arms trafficking through sovereign Irish airspace and hold the companies that are accountable criminally responsible. They are things that could and should have been done by the parties in government but they failed to do any of them. What that says to me is that neither Fianna Fáil nor Fine Gael can be trusted to do the right thing."

We are told that this cannot be done or this amendment has to be done. We have tens of thousands of very able civil servants.

It is good that Ireland has been very much to the forefront in speaking out against the actions of Israel and in condemning them, but we have not done what we could do, which are the things that are within our control, number one of which is the occupied territories Bill. The Minister of State's own party agreed with it before they were in government and now they cannot seem to put it into action. What we need in this Chamber is to all grow a bit of a spine to stop what is going on with the munitions flights going through our airspace even as the people in this State are completely on the side of the people of Gaza and even as we are constantly telling Israel to stop. Yet, we then find out - not from the Minister or from the Government - from The Ditch that munitions are being flown over and through our airspace. Not only that, we then find out that The Ditch warned the Government in advance at least four times that this was going to happen on four separate occasions and the Government did nothing about it. When I say that we need to grow a spine my God it is this Government that needs to grow a spine. It is really outrageous. It goes against the complete will of the Irish people, it goes against what is morally right and it goes against what is legally right. It is absolutely shocking.",

I look forward to hearing his response on that. We must ask ourselves what it is we are doing to stop this genocide and what role we have as a State in allowing this to continue. This may be the last day of this Dáil term but one thing that had always united this entire Dáil was the issue of Gaza. We stood together in relation to this. It is incredibly disappointing that now at the conclusion of this Dáil we did not and could not do what we wanted to do such as the occupied territories Bill, to stand strong against what is happening in Israel and to put our heads above the parapet, and not just shout stop but make sure that we have no hand, act or part in the genocide in Gaza. Unfortunately now the time has run out. The Dáil will probably be dissolved tomorrow and none of this will have happened. I find this outrageous."

I believe that the answer on a two-state solution is absolutely clear from Benjamin Netanyahu. We all welcome that we recognise the State of Palestine. We recognise the appointment of the ambassador properly but what will she be ambassador to? Who will be left? What are we talking about? I believe that Benjamin Netanyahu, as he makes sure that he holds on to his job, is willing to do whatever is necessary. He does not care who he has to kill, whether that is in Lebanon, whether it is endangering our own UN troops out there, or whether that is in an absolute and disgraceful humanitarian apocalypse in north Gaza.

It is not a word that should be used lightly or a word that we in this House are using lightly. It is the only appropriate word to use to describe the horror which is now unfolding in Gaza. What other word is there? It makes the legal definition that we understood under the Genocide Convention that the civilised world drafted to prevent a repeat of the horrors of the 1930s and 1940s.",

However limited our power is here - the Government side can say it cannot really stop anything- we have a moral responsibility to use whatever leverage and mechanisms we have, not in a protracted legal discourse but to take direct action to say, \"Stop, and stop now\". The people of Ireland demand that we reflect their horror at what is ongoing now in Gaza, with practical actions of defiance and a rejection of the ongoing carnage being visited on the Palestinian people.",

The response of the Israeli Government and defence forces is entirely, wholly and completely disproportionate and illegal. We must act. This House is united in seeking to pass the occupied territories Bill. There can be no acceptable reason why the Bill was not passed this week. There is no logical reason for it.

Enormous moral pressure will be put on Ireland in the next Dáil and next government to appease him.

                "I thank the Social Democrats for tabling this important motion on the horror we are witnessing being committed by Israel and its allies in Gaza and Lebanon. Since dawn this morning, 22 Palestinians have been murdered by Israel and 40 people in Lebanon have been murdered by Israel. Since October last year, that brings it to a horrific total of about 48,000 people we know of who have been massacred by this regime. Seventeen thousand of them are children, who have been butchered by Israel. One thousand or so of those are less than one year old. All of those people have been massacred with US weapons and European weapons. They have given Israel the weapons to kill those children and to incinerate 48,000, and more likely many more people than that, to utterly destroy Gaza, and now to try to repeat the genocidal massacre that they have inflicted on the people of Gaza in Lebanon.",
                "None of this would have happened if the western world had sanctioned Israel long before October last year for the decades of crimes that it was committing against the Palestinian people, because it did not start last October. Impunity has been given to Israel as it conducted its decades-long campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Palestinian people. The western world armed Israel while it ethnically cleansed the Palestinian people, while it established 700,000 illegal settlers after the so-called Oslo Accords, after it waged repeated savage military assaults on Gaza, imposed a siege of Gaza and, before October last year, killed so many that it was the deadliest year for Palestinian children in recent times. It conducted a campaign of ethnic cleansing, seizure of Palestinian land and the imposition of an apartheid regime on the Palestinian people. All of this was allowed by the western powers and, for the most part, actively facilitated. It gave Israel the weapons, the favoured trade status and legitimised and justified this regime as if it was some kind of normal state. That is how we have got here.",
                "When the history books are written, they will tell a story of shame of western governments, which stood there and did nothing as a genocide took place in front of our eyes, and where the Government's so-called allies in the United States gave Israel the weapons and support to carry on that genocide. Indeed, its allies in the European Union, the UK and so on gave Israel the weapons, means and political support to carry on this genocidal massacre. That is a fact. The Government still will not even use the word \"apartheid\" to describe this regime. It still gags on using the word and does not use the word \"genocide\" to describe that. The reason for that is if you acknowledge that this is an apartheid regime built on ethnic cleansing and if you acknowledge that this is genocide, then you would have to impose sanctions to deter it, which is why the Government does not want to do it. Some legal case that may be fully resolved or addressed in a year or two will be too late for the massacred Palestinian people.",
                "What the Government needs to do now is, at the minimum, pass the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018. It is a disgrace that it has not. The Government needs to expel the Israeli ambassador. It needs to stop US arms and weapons for Israel going through Shannon Airport. It needs to stop Israeli war bonds being sold through the Irish Central Bank. It needs to support, as we did against apartheid South Africa, full boycott, divestment and sanctions against a regime guilty of genocide and apartheid. Anything else would not honour our obligations to stand against this horror."

What we are seeing on our television screens every night is almost unbearable to watch, but you have to keep watching, because if you turn away, it will keep happening. The past 13 months have been exceptional in the absolute inhumanity of what is being done to the people of Gaza. The only parallel I can make in the politicisation of the world is the Vietnam War. In the Vietnam War, in the 1960s and 1970s, a huge generation became politicised. During that war, it is hard to believe that 2 million people from Vietnam and Cambodia were massacred. What makes a so-called country want to kill 2 million people? The only things I can think of are hatred and racism. That is the only logic of what is happening in Gaza today.",
                "The facts are stark. In the past 13 months, we have witnessed the greatest concentration of armaments since the Second World War. The irony of that is that the Jewish people themselves suffered terribly under the Nazis in the Second World War. Now we are seeing a concentration of violence that we have never witnessed before. We acknowledge that this country has done better than other European countries but it has to do a lot better. The occupied territories Bill should have been passed by now. This is legislation that has been around since 2018, which is six years ago. How the Israeli ambassador is still in the country is beyond me. I know she is on gardening leave but we should tell her that she should stay on gardening leave in the Zionist state. She should never, ever be welcome in this country. There is a movement across this country and the world that says this cannot be tolerated because if it is tolerated then everybody's children will be next."

These figures highlight the severe humanitarian crisis and underscore the importance of addressing this issue urgently. Ireland should always advocate for peace in the Middle East as a neutral country. Our history and lack of colonial legacy positions us uniquely to mediate and promote conflict resolution. While it is crucial to speak out against genocide and human rights violations, taking sides can be counterproductive and damage our neutrality and long-term prospects of peace. The humanitarian crisis in Gaza is dire, with widespread displacement, destruction, and food insecurity. Ireland must continue to push for international aid and support for the affected populations.",
                "Highlighting the need for a balanced approach, we should advocate for both immediate humanitarian relief and long-term political solutions to ensure sustainable peace. Ireland’s strong stance on Middle East issues, particularly its criticism of Israel’s actions, has occasionally strained relations with the US, a key ally of Israel. Balancing our commitment to human rights with diplomatic relations is essential. We must ensure our actions do not undermine our strategic partnerships, especially with the US, which is vital for our economic and our country's interests.",
                "As a signatory to the genocide convention, Ireland has a legal and moral duty to prevent and punish acts of genocide. This includes taking a firm stance against any actions that constitute genocide. However, our approach should be measured and focused on promoting dialogue and peace rather than escalating tensions. Iran’s involvement in the region, which is not mentioned in the motion, particularly through its proxies like Hezbollah and, indeed, funding of Hamas, has significantly contributed to the ongoing tensions. lran’s support for these groups has been a strategic move to counterbalance its adversaries, notably Israel and Saudi Arabia. This influence complicates the situation further, as it adds another layer of conflict and instability to the region. Addressing the role of external actors like Iran is crucial in any comprehensive peace effort. By maintaining a balanced and principled stance, Ireland can effectively contribute to peace in the Middle East while safeguarding Its neutrality and international relationships.",
                "On the economic impact, sanctions could disrupt economic relations between Israel and the sanctioning countries; this could also affect industries such as technology, agriculture and defence, leading to economic losses on both sides. Sanctions may strain diplomatic relations, not only between Israel and the sanctioning countries but also with allies of Israel, such as the United States. We in Ireland have 300,000 people working here in US firms and with the new administration in the States, it is imperative that bridges are rebuilt with the United States to protect our FDI sector.",
                "In Clonmel alone - the wonderful town of Cluain Meala, the vale of honey - we have nearly 6,000 FDI supported jobs. Merck, Sharp and Dohme, for example, is there for almost 60 years and it is a wonderful company. We have Abbott and Boston Scientific and trasna an bhóthair in Contae Phort Láirge in Dungarvan there are another couple of thousand jobs. It is vital to the south east and to our economy. Those workers and their families are so welcome in south Tipperary and Clonmel and are so welcome in Ireland. They contribute to a huge industry and have a huge social impact as well. The supply and service industry that supports them is huge and is nearly as big as the FDI job numbers themselves.",
                "On regional stability, sanctions might exacerbate tensions in the Middle East, potentially leading to increased instability. This could affect neighbouring countries and contribute to a broader regional conflict. While sanctions aim to pressure governments, they can also inadvertently harm civilians by limiting access to essential goods and services. This could worsen the humanitarian situation in the region. It is hard to believe it could be worse but it could actually and we have to be careful. Israel might respond to sanctions with its own set of retaliatory measures, which could include economic or diplomatic actions against the sanctioning countries. This could lead to a tit-for-tat escalation, further complicating international relations.",
                "Sanctions could hinder ongoing peace efforts by hardening positions and reducing the willingness of parties to engage in dialogue. This could make it more difficult to achieve a negotiated settlement to the conflicts. That would be the totally wrong thing to do and the wrong outcome. The imposition of sanctions must be carefully considered to ensure they comply with international law and do not violate human rights further. There is a risk that poorly designed sanctions could be seen as unjust or discriminatory.",
                "In summary, while sanctions are a tool to exert pressure, they come with significant risks that need to be carefully weighed up. A balanced approach that considers both the immediate and long-term consequences is essential to avoid unintended negative consequences. I appealed on Tuesday during the Order of Business for the Dáil to sit tomorrow to pass the occupied territories Bill. Today is not a very busy day. We discussed this at the Business Committee. Two of the parties here, Sinn Féin and the Social Democrats, offered their Private Members' time to do it. If the Government were willing or interested enough to pass this, it would have been passed. It should have been passed and the Dáil could have sat for another day if necessary. It is such an important issue and we need to show there is unanimous support in the House for that cause. I do not know why the Government has dragged its feet and there was an outright refusal to pass this legislation."

This is an incredibly important issue for the Irish people. The marches, vigils and protests calling for a ceasefire that we have seen across the country over the past year have shown once again that the people are ahead of the Government on this. We have been shown this week, through the response to the FOI request published by The Ditch, which mainstream media tried to ignore, that this Government of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party is more interested in appeasing the Americans than listening to the voices of hundreds of thousands of Irish people.",

Hospitals in Gaza continued to be attacked and journalists, healthcare and humanitarian workers continue to work under life threatening conditions. A month ago, Gaza's Ministry of Health reported more than 43,000 Palestinians, including 16,000 children, had been killed in Israeli attacks and thousands more were buried under rubble and threatened by illness. That number is most definitely significantly higher now. Every day brings new atrocities. The Palestinian people must feel completely abandoned by the European Union and the international community; they are right and they have been.",

This Government had every opportunity to pass this Bill and it did not. A future government must ensure this Bill is passed and our airports and air space are not used to transport arms. We must close Shannon Airport to the US military by banning US military aircraft from landing at the airport. Ireland needs to take a meaningful stand against America's facilitation of Israeli genocide against Palestine. In terms of meaningful actions that Ireland can take to support the people of Palestine, this is by far the most important. It is well beyond time to take that action and ensure Ireland plays no part in aiding Israel's apartheid regime."

I can tell the Government that it is completely out of touch with the despair, despondency and anger felt by people on the ground.

They are angry with all of us, notwithstanding our best efforts to do something about this.",

We do not know the figures because journalists are not allowed in there. We have no way of monitoring this. UNRWA was the only agency there. It should not have been there at all from day one but that was the way it was set up. Questions have to be asked about why we needed UNRWA in the first place, but Gaza and Palestine could not have survived without it. Now, the government of Israel, in its wisdom, is going to do away with that as well.",

These include 1,000 healthcare workers and 183 journalists killed. I am sure it is higher than that. I do not want to single out anyone, but we have watched this genocide being committed under our watch, while we look at it, and in our name. More than 42 million tonnes of rubble and a large concentration of explosive hazards, in addition to everything else, pose an imminent threat to civilians, while the entry of specialised personnel and equipment and the conduct of explosive ordnance disposal activities are restricted. The bombardment by Israel from air, land and sea across the Gaza Strip continues to be reported and we get a Tánaiste who came here today to tell us nothing really, except we must be very careful. He is well able to tell us that we utterly and unreservedly condemn these brutal attacks - this was the attack on 7 October, which we are all on record as condemning - but he does not go on to condemn Israel. He used words such as, \"[It is] beyond any moral compass\", which I welcome, but following from that, if the action of the government in Israel and its army is \"beyond any moral compass\", then a different speech should be written, if those words are to mean anything. The first thing we should say is that we unreservedly condemn the continuous action of the Israeli army and its government in relation to the people of Gaza, and we unreservedly condemn genocide. These are the words that follow if the action is \"beyond any moral compass\".",

The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, finally told us, and the Minister of State might clarify this because the Tánaiste did not, that the memo that was to be brought to Government this week was to allow for increased powers to search, sanction and sample. That is clearly a recognition that arms are going through Shannon Airport. For the first time, we are now admitting that they are going through Shannon, In the past three and a half years alone, 222,000 US soldiers have gone through. Are they going to a party somewhere? Are they going somewhere without arms? Surely, the Government should question what the purpose of the soldiers coming through is.",

Our words are just empty rhetoric really. We are in a sense of despondency that this is happening. We are attending vigils, and I do not like protest, and gatherings of people who are at their wits' end begging us to do something. We are receiving 10,000 to 15,000 emails. We are not in a position to deal with other emails because of the sense of outrage being outlined to us.",
                "The occupied territories Bill did not come out yesterday. For years, Sadaka and all the organisations on the ground have begged us. Fair play to Senator Black and her colleagues who pushed this. The recognition of Palestine was included in the programme for Government in 2020. That did not happen overnight. That happened after years and years of campaigning and because Gaza has been under siege. History did not start on 7 October. It certainly did not. It is incumbent on us to read the history books and read everything possible. We know that there has been a 100 years' war on Palestine, deliberately created first by England, followed by America and then with the EU colluding. Let us remember that lovely woman who is in charge of the Commission who told us she stood shoulder to shoulder with Netanyahu because he made the desert bloom. This is the type of language we are colluding with. I will not collude with it; neither will the parties on this side of the House collude with it, not for the sake of objection or opposition for opposition's sake, but because this is morally wrong. It is criminal. Israel has got away with this and we have let it act with impunity. It has designated human rights organisations as terrorist. It has ignored the Amnesty report, as has the Government, which clearly laid out, after years of research, that Israel is operating an apartheid regime.",
                "The International Court of Justice, the highest court in the world, has told us that the occupation of the West Bank and other occupations are illegal, yet we still trade with Israel and still wait for the morally corrupt leadership of the EU to lead us. It is time we led as an independent republic and independent sovereign state, when our history has given us the clear mandate to act because of our history."

As a mother of six children, my heart breaks every time I see Salma's face.

If that is the best that Ireland can do, then the Government must accept that it leaves us complicit in this genocide. That is not in my name. I am very concerned by the rhetoric coming from the US ambassador in regard to the occupied territories Bill and the threat that Ireland cannot control our own foreign relations decisions.

The humanitarian situation is Gaza is truly horrific. Israeli aerial, land and maritime bombardments continue to pummel the Gaza Strip and its population. This is completely unacceptable. More than 43,000 people have been killed and over 100,000 injured. More than 1.9 million people in Gaza are internally displaced, which is almost 90% of the population.

It is for this reason that the Government will not oppose the motion.

We do so with full consideration of the overall political and legal landscape. Real change will not be brought about by unilateral measures or symbolic gestures. Our goals remain clear. We need to see an immediate de-escalation of the conflict across the region, an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the immediate release of hostages and a massive scale-up of humanitarian aid into Gaza. Ireland is committed to using all the tools at its disposal - political, legal, diplomatic and humanitarian - to respond to the conflict and work toward achieving these aims. We have provided a total of €56 million in support of the Palestinian people since the beginning of last year. Of this, €40 million has been provided in humanitarian assistance in response to the suffering caused by the conflict in Gaza since last October.",

It sent a clear signal to the rest of the world of Ireland's solidarity at a time of immense despair for the Palestinian people. The recognition of Palestine is not the end of a process; it is the start. Ireland is deeply committed to the pursuit of peace and support for Palestinian state-building, and we have been for many decades. Our intensive diplomacy and long-standing development co-operation programmes are testament to this fact.",

Ireland's support for a two-state solution to the Palestinian conflict has long been, and remains, a core priority of our foreign policy. A two-state solution is the only just and sustainable peaceful solution for Palestinians and Israeli citizens.

The Government has consistently expressed its intention to file a declaration of intervention in this case. The Government previously confirmed to the House that its long-standing intention was to file this declaration after South Africa had filed its memorial. South Africa filed its memorial last week and the court's order gives Israel until 25 July 2025 to submit its counter-memorial. The Government has taken active steps to progress Ireland's declaration of intervention consistent with its aim of filing the declaration before the end of the year. Subject to the court's ruling on the admissibility of our intervention, Ireland will then make robust submissions to the court on the proper interpretation of the Genocide Convention.",
                "The Government has consistently stated that both Israel and Hamas must be held accountable for violations of international humanitarian law committed. All parties to armed conflict, states and non-states alike, have duties under international law. I mentioned that the UN system and institutions of international law and accountability, which Ireland works hard to promote and support, are under unprecedented pressure. It is unacceptable, for example, for the foreign minister of Israel to declare the Secretary General of the UN to be persona non grata. What is even more egregious are the developments that have sadly taken place in recent weeks. Last week, the Israeli Parliament, the Knesset, took the decision to adopt two pieces of legislation, which, if implemented, will make it impossible for UNRWA to carry out its lifesaving work. UNRWA is a UN agency with a mandate from the UN General Assembly - a mandate from the nations of the world. It is the backbone of the humanitarian response in Gaza and the main provider of education, health and social services in Gaza and the West Bank. UNRWA's work is essential and irreplaceable for millions of Palestinian refugees in the region, particularly in the current context in Gaza. If implemented, this legislation will only deepen the unspeakable suffering of ordinary Palestinians in desperate need of lifesaving help. The Government has strongly condemned this move. It amounts to collective punishment and could have generational repercussions for the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians affected by it.",
                "Ireland has spoken up loudly and decisively in defence of UNRWA. When Israel issued claims earlier this year alleging that a number of UNRWA employees are members of terrorist organisations, allegations for which an independent report has since found no supportive evidence was provided, several countries halted their funding to the organisation, which put it at existential risk. Ireland instead contributed an extra €20 million. In fact, Ireland has provided €38 million in core support to UNRWA during 2023 and 2024. This supports UNRWA's programmes in Gaza and the West Bank, including east Jerusalem, as well as in Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. We are following up on this support now, with the agency again facing existential peril. Ireland, Norway, Slovenia and Spain issued a joint statement on 29 October condemning the approval of the legislation and committing to continuing to work with donor and host countries to ensure the viability of UNRWA's work and its humanitarian role.",
                "As the Government has previously set out, there are no military exports from Ireland to Israel. The Tánaiste clearly explained earlier the regulation of dual-use licences in Ireland, which is carried out fully in line with our international obligations, including the EU's dual-use regulation and common position. The Government has on numerous occasions outlined the policies and procedures which pertain to overflights of sovereign airspace. On sanctions, the House is aware that Ireland does not impose unilateral domestic sanctions. At EU level, we have adopted successive rounds of sanctions against violent Israeli settlers and support the fact that further sanctions are under consideration.",
                "We are under no illusions as to the scale of the challenges still ahead. Much more remains to be done. Too many generations of Palestinians have seen and experienced too much suffering. Advocating for their right to self-determination, freedom and peace will remain a central focus of the Government. Everyone in the Middle East deserves peace. Continuing the status quo is not an option. That way only extremism, radicalisation and violence will lie. This House, I have no doubt, is absolutely united in its conviction that the ongoing horror must be brought to an immediate end and for a peaceful, sustained solution to this conflict to be realised. In that spirit, the Government will not oppose today's motion. I already outlined the reasons we cannot support it. I am convinced, however, that this House will continue to ensure that Ireland remains the proud, fearless voice for peace we have always been. The Government will continue to use all the tools at its disposal to do so."

They want courage from their Government and they want to be able to say we did everything possible to stop this genocide. In ten years' time, the question that will be put to us is \"What did you do?\" Claiming we are doing things and expressing our outrage will not suffice. We need to use all our policy tools and measures, and the Government needs to do so now."

The Tánaiste said the ICJ judgment in July changed the legal context of the Bill. That is fine, and I absolutely accept that. However, it was only in October that the Tánaiste instructed his officials to look at where those amendments might be needed. He said earlier that some of the signatories of the Bill accepted that substantial amendments were needed. I was at the meeting of the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence on Tuesday, and that was not what Senator Black and her team said. They very clearly stated that when the Bill that Senator Black brought to the Seanad and Fianna Fáil brought to the Dáil was being developed, it was to be brought to the committee and some amendments could be made. They said they already had some legal arguments regarding amendments and should they be needed, they could have been progressed quickly. However, the Tánaiste sat on the ICJ judgment since July before bringing the Bill back in October for nothing more than a conversation. Now we are being told that it is all very complicated and we would not understand it, so we will have to do it at some point in the future. It is absolutely shocking.",

That is not the case. When South Africa made its case to the International Court of Justice, we specifically said that we should not wait to align ourselves but should submit our own case and add weight to the case. South Africa's case is built on rhetoric. It is built on the genocidal statements of Israeli officials. That is what they are debating at the moment. We could have added weight by submitting our own case based on any number of things, including famine, which is so important to the Irish tradition. We could have added huge weight by bringing a case based on famine.",

All we offer is rhetoric and the Palestinian people are supposed to be grateful to the Irish State. It is horrific.",

He said: \"The timing ... was carefully calibrated with other partners to build momentum.\" We recognised the Palestinian State, while at the same time Gaza was being obliterated. At that point, over 30,000 people, including women and children, had been killed, mosques, hospitals and centres of education were being bombed and all memory was being wiped out, and we put a flag up saying \"Now we recognise you.\" Ten years after the case and four years after Government had provided for it in the programme for Government, yet we are supposed to ask Palestinians to be grateful. It is horrific.",

We talked of complicity today and of not willing to be complicit in a genocide that is being carried out on the people of Gaza by Israel. The Tánaiste pushed back and said that was outrageous and that the Government was not complicit. We are complicit when planes carrying munitions fly through sovereign Irish airspace and we turn our gaze away. I have heard the Government condemn more the journalists who broke the story than the transport companies breaking the rules. That is extraordinary.",

We are watching it being filmed live. They do not have time to wait for undefined periods in the future when we can be brave or courageous. We are a small state. I accept we are limited in what we can do but the Genocide Convention has more than 140 signatories. That means some of us can stand up collectively, call it for what it is and be braver. At this point, we have failed in our obligations and the Irish Government has failed in its duties. It wants to be praised because the bar is so low. I do not think we will do that. Words no longer matter. About six months ago, the Taoiseach said \"You cannot build peace on the ... graves of children\". Those graves have increased in number in the time we offered words and nothing else."

                "Ar an lá deireanach den Dáil seo, caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil cur amú millteanach airgid phoiblí ar siúl ag an Rialtas seo. Tá a fhios againn anois nár inis an Rialtas an scéal iomlán faoin €9 milliún atá le caitheamh aige ar phúitsí d'fhóin phóca. Tá €1 milliún breise le caitheamh gach bliain. Tá ceisteanna móra le freagairt ag an Rialtas faoi seo.",
                "The general election will be called tomorrow and the Government's waste of public money will be high on the agenda of the campaign. The Government's catalogue of waste reads like a bad comedy where the joke is always on the taxpayer, but nobody is laughing. Nobody is laughing at the €336,000 that the Government squandered on a bike shed. People did not see the funny side when the Government wasted €1.4 million of people's money on a security hut. They definitely did not burst out laughing when they heard that the cost of modular units for Ukrainians had more than doubled. People could not believe their ears, especially since so many families are struggling to get by, to pay the bills, to afford the weekly shop, to make it to the end of the week.",
                "Then we come to the craziness of the €9 million that the Government is wasting on mobile phone pouches. People were left shaking their heads in disbelief with this one but it turns out that the Government could not even be straight with the people when it was called out on this issue. The Government was at pains to stress that this was a one-off spend. The Minister, Deputy Norma Foley, went to the media to firm up on that message. The Minister even wrote an article where the headline stated it was a \"once-off investment\". The Tánaiste did that too. A couple of weeks ago, when I questioned the Tánaiste here in the Dáil on Leaders' Questions on the phone pouches, he stood there and said that this was once-off expenditure but now we know that is not true. Is not that the case, Micheál?",
                "The documents that I have received under freedom of information show that it is not true and they raise a lot of serious questions surrounding the story that the Tánaiste and his Minister, Deputy Foley, spun to the public. First, why were we not told that there would be a cost of nearly €2 million every single year for these phone pouches? Why were we not told that nearly 100,000 of these pouches would have to be replaced every year? Why were we not told that the Minister, Deputy Foley, was intensely lobbied by an executive from Yondr, a company that makes these mobile phone pouches? Why were we not told that the Minister met this executive at a conference two years ago where the executive gave her a phone pouch from Yondr? This does not add up, because I recently asked Deputy Foley, on the Dáil record, if she had any meeting with a representative of a company that produces these mobile phone pouches and she answered, \"No.\", and it is simply not the case. The meeting happened and a phone pouch was given. That happened over two years ago. This is crazy stuff.",
                "Not only has the Government decided to waste €9 million of the public's money on phone pouches, but its story on why and how the decision was taken is as clear as mud, especially when there was a list provided to the Minister for Education of other commonsense solutions that would have resulted in the banning of mobile phones in the classroom but would have cost the taxpayers zero. The other options would have cost the taxpayer zero. It leaves people wondering why all of this dodginess, why all of the evasiveness? Why is the Government not telling the people the full story here?",
                "What this proves beyond a shadow of a doubt is that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael cannot be trusted with the public's money properly. It is not only the waste on the mobile phone pouches or the waste on the bike shed or the security hut. Just look at the runaway costs in terms of the children's hospital, if one wants to make that point.",
                "Now is the time to clear all of this up. Can the Tánaiste answer the questions that I put? Why were we not told that it would cost more - €2 million every year? Why were we not told that another nearly 100,000 mobile phone pouches would have to be bought every year because the others would have to be replaced? Why were we not told that the Minister met with an executive of Yondr and a phone pouch was given to her over two years ago? Why were we not told any of this? Why did the Government try to cover all of this up?"

We are all part of a community and I am very grateful to every one of them for making it work as well as it has. This Dáil was a particularly challenging Dáil. If one remembers, at the start of this Dáil, we had the enormous disruption of Covid-19 and all of those responsibilities had to be transplanted to another venue. Indeed, I was elected as Taoiseach in that other venue. They were strange times indeed, but everybody in this entire community made it work and I am very grateful to them. I want to take this opportunity to put on the record my appreciation and thanks to the excellent public servants and private-office teams in the Department of the Taoiseach, office of the Tánaiste and Departments of Foreign Affairs and Defence for their tremendous support over the course of the past four and a half years and, indeed, wish all those elected representatives who are retiring the very best of health and happiness in the years ahead.",

Rinneadh infheistíocht chruinn agus mhaith i gcúrsaí sláinte agus mar sin de. I disagree fundamentally with the Deputy's assertion in respect of an issue that they are trying to engineer for the election. It is as clear as night follows day the sort of high feigned outrage about the issue in terms of smart phones in schools. The Deputy is desperately grasping at the straws to grab an issue that he thinks might rescue or help him in the election campaign.",

If one looks at the Macroom by-pass, for example, right through to Baile Bhuirne, it is extraordinary value for money and has huge impacts for the public as well.",

His Ministers are all over this, the waste of public money, not just on this but the national children's hospital as well, a runaway train. The Minister for Health oversees that project. He is a Fianna Fáil Minister. I asked the Tánaiste specific questions. He did not tell the truth. The Government kept the information from the public. I asked why we were not told that there would be an additional €2 million cost on the phone pouches every single year. Why did he stand there a number of weeks ago and say this was a one-off cost? Answer that question. The Tánaiste should tell me why he never told us that there would have to be up to 100,000 of these phone pouches replaced and bought every single year? The Tánaiste should tell me why he did not tell the public that the Minister, Deputy Foley, was lobbied by an executive from Yondr, the company that makes these phone pouches. Please explain to me why the Minister, Deputy Foley, in a reply to a parliamentary question on the record of this Dáil, when I asked if she had any meeting with an executive from any of the phone companies, she said \"No\". It is clear, however, from the correspondence from the executive in Yondr, which starts. \"Dear Norma\" and hopes she is well. It reminds the Minister that she met the executive at the NAPD conference last October, which was in 2022, where the executive gave her a Yondr pouch for her to see it herself. There was extensive lobbying after that. Why is the Tánaiste not coming clean with the public? He tries to dismiss this as a non-issue. It is a serious issue of waste of public money, of a vanity project by a Fianna Fáil Minister who was extensively lobbied by an executive, who was given a pouch, and who misled this Dáil throughout the process."

                "On the last day of the Thirty-third Dáil, as we prepare for an election, people will be thinking about who they are going to vote for. I hope people will be wary of political parties that have a track record of broken promises. For example, in the last election campaign you promised to deliver 50,000 affordable purchase homes. After nearly five years in government, how many of them have been delivered? Less than 1,000, that is, 988 to be precise. That is just 2% of the Government's target. Last year no affordable purchase homes were delivered in 19 of the 31 council areas. In Dublin City Council not one affordable purchase home was delivered, nor in Galway city and county, Louth, Clare or Wicklow. I could go on. Even in those areas where a small number of affordable homes were built, the prices were nowhere near affordable. In Lusk in north Dublin, the full price of so-called affordable homes is in excess of €550,000, more than half a million euro. How can one call that an affordable home? This is not just an abuse of language, it is a con.",

Every week, I meet people whose dreams of homeownership are crushed, people in their 20s, 30s and 40s who are still living in their childhood bedrooms, others who are still cramped in house shares because they cannot afford to rent alone. They are people who work hard and do not expect a whole lot in return. They are not looking for mansions, just a modest home, a secure roof over their head, somewhere they can start to build a life and family and put down roots in a community. Whatever they do, it is not enough. I find the worst is when I meet people and they feel their housing insecurity is a personal failure. I want to say very clearly to those people, you have done nothing wrong. You have been failed by this Government and by previous Governments that have turned a housing crisis into a complete housing disaster and have broken commitment after commitment.",

                "I thank the Deputy for raising what is the most significant social issue of our generation. This Government, notwithstanding Covid-19, has made very significant progress and initiated a range of actions and initiatives on social and affordable homes of different types and supports for first-time buyers. A total of 125,000 new homes have been built since 2020, notwithstanding the lockdowns. That is way in excess of anything that had happened in the previous years. More homes have been completed in the past four and a half years than in the previous nine years combined, and we will exceed our Housing for All completion targets again this year. The pipeline is extremely strong, with work having begun on nearly 60,000 new homes in the past 12 months. That is almost double the figure for the previous 12-month period. Close to 33,000 homes were completed in 2023, the highest number in 15 years. Under the budget for 2025, for whichever new Government comes in, €6 billion has been provided in capital spending to help deliver social, affordable and cost-rental houses. Planning permissions for over 41,000 homes were granted in 2023, an increase of 21%.",
                "It is clear that very significant momentum has been built up in respect of housing, and particularly on social housing, for example. Over 40,000 social homes had been added to the social housing stock up to quarter 2 of 2024, which is a significant achievement that dwarfs anything that was done prior to this period in government. We have seen the highest level of new-build social homes since 1975, with 8,110 new builds in 2023 out of a total of 12,000 built through various mechanisms, and a strong pipeline of social houses is coming.",
                "In terms of affordability, we have expanded the help-to-buy scheme to support home ownership and 51,500 first-time buyers have been helped by the help-to-buy scheme. We have also introduced the first home bridge the gap scheme, which has significantly enabled a lot of young people to afford a house. We have introduced the cost-rental concept to bring in affordable rents and about 2,200 have been delivered by AHBs, local authorities and the LDA and through the cost-rental tenant in situ scheme. Nearly 6,000 affordable homes have been delivered as a result of all these initiatives. On the first home bridge the gap scheme, about 5,500 buyers have been approved. We have brought 10,000 vacant properties back into use. We have introduced a vacant property refurbishment grant of up to €70,000 where a property is derelict and close to 7,000 approvals have issued already.",
                "By any objective assessment, huge progress has been made, but we need to do an awful lot more. We need to maintain this momentum and build more houses in a faster way over the next five years."

He does not answer the question and he paints an entirely different picture.",

At the moment, up to 100,000 vacant properties, in the middle of the biggest housing disaster, lie empty around the country while people are stuck at home in their childhood bedrooms or are experiencing homelessness, and the Government introduced the most pathetic excuse for a vacancy tax, at 0.3% at a time when house price inflation was at 10%. It then put it at zero-point-something-else percent in the budget. If it wanted to tackle vacancy to try to actually bring those homes back into use, it would have matched the rate to, at the very least, the rate of house price inflation.",
                "What it has done is introduce an incentive to continue sitting on a vacant property. We could say the same for stamp duty. The Government could ban the bulk purchasing of homes if it introduced a tax with teeth but it has not done that. It creates all this spin and a picture of introducing a vacancy tax and stamp duty to prevent the bulk purchasing of homes but neither of them is effective because house price inflation is higher than the tax the Government has set for vacancy. That is one example.",

I also want to say, however, that I am looking forward to not banging my head off a wall. I have done it for the past nine years and have had enough of it. Hazel can bang her head off the wall when she comes in here. I have fantastic colleagues and we have worked really hard to make a difference. We have put forward radical Bills that would change people's lives, make big changes to the climate and environment, make changes to the housing crisis the Government created and dent the desperation people feel in health, homelessness, housing and kids' special needs, and every which way, we have been blocked by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, as have other progressive measures from the rest of the Opposition.",
                "I want to focus today on how we end 100 years of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. When I was born in 1957, de Valera was in power, and before that, it had been Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael since the State was founded. We still have Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, although they have shrunk so much they have had to join forces. When will these parties stop making promises before an election and then breaking them once they get into power? When will they stop treating people as if they are just tools for their idea of control and power? To be honest, they have always preferred the interests of big business, developers, bankers and the rich in this country and that is why, as we live in one of the wealthiest countries on the planet, we have one of the greatest levels of inequality. It is to our shame that that is what goes on.",
                "I also have a question for all of the Opposition groups and party leaders. When will they stop propping up Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael and will they make a commitment to the Irish people that if they are returned in this election, they will not prop up either of these 100-year-old parties of failure? The failure is enormous. There is huge suffering in the homes of Ireland today, with kids with special needs and scoliosis, and people living in crowded, emotionally dangerous conditions, without any hope for the future. Young workers are exiting this country when they have their degrees, whether in education or health, to make a life for themselves elsewhere. As we close the Dáil today, the Government’s refusal to sanction Israel has been an utter disgrace and will be a legacy of the previous Dáil that nobody will accept. It is an utter disgrace that the Government has not passed the occupied territories Bill but it is now kicking it around as if it gives the Government some credibility.",

We have to end the 100 years of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, break the cycle and give people a real alternative. All of us on this side of the House have a responsibility to do that, including, by the way, those who call themselves Independents, who cannot wait to prop up either of the parties after the election."

However, it is important to meet head-on the narrative that the Deputy and her hard-left wing colleagues, along with Sinn Féin, are peddling: that the history of Ireland in the last century is somehow a history of failure and that Ireland is some sort of a failed state. That is a pernicious, insidious lie. The truth is that we have come from being one of the of the most poverty stricken countries in the 1920s to now having one of the highest standards of living in the world, with more people in employment than ever before. These are good jobs. In the past 30 years, the number of people in high-skilled employment has increased by 150%. I know the Deputy genuinely does not have an interest in this.

The economic model in this country has worked and it should be debated in this election. I believe in the economic model that has attracted enterprise into the country and allowed native enterprise to develop and grow. Less well known, but equally uninteresting to the Deputy, is that our indigenous companies are among the most productive in all of Europe. For every job created in Ireland by a foreign company, Irish-domiciled companies create more than one elsewhere. This makes us one of the top five nations in the world for creating overseas jobs. We are exporting more goods than ever before and we are world leaders in food and drink exports. We export 90% of what we produce and our goods are shipping to more markets and further across the world than ever before.",

We now have an education system that is one of the strongest in Europe and the world. The number of children at secondary level and school completion rates are tops across the European Union and the world more generally. Pupil-teacher ratios have never been better."

We can throw figures across the floor at each other but these are facts that the Tánaiste does not address. As a left-wing TD and a socialist, I came in here to try to address them, and that is why I talked about the headbanging exercise. The Government is not interested in ending inequality in this country. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are only interested in looking after the wealthy, the businessmen, the developers and those who gained millions of euro in profit by ripping off people in the cost-of-living crisis in this country. They have never challenged them. Yes, the Government will throw us all a few hundred euros towards electricity bills but it never challenges the profiteering and never challenges those who are milking it in this country. Hence the inequality.",
                "It is not rocket science to say that if there is extreme wealth at the other end and extreme poverty at this end, there is a way of knitting the two together and ending poverty and inequality. That is to tax the wealth of the rich, take the money off them and stop being their favourite guys in the Dáil. Be the favourite guys of the ordinary people. That is why I say to the Members on this side of the House that we have a duty to stop propping up Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael and create a real left alternative to run this country."

                "I feel like I am flogging a dead dog with this one, but anyway, one last time with feeling, I suppose. I recall listening to an interview between Newstalk’s Kieran Cuddihy and the Tánaiste. He kind of caught him off guard by asking why he wanted to be Taoiseach. His answer was simple: \"community\". I always felt that the Tánaiste uses the term “community” in the John McGahern sense of the close-knit bonds of tradition, shared experience and the familiarity of your own personal hinterland that shaped you deeply. Watching the Tánaiste's career, it is apparent that the oppressive weight of Cork's expectations, its deep hurts, the poverty and the hopelessness that was seared with the Sunbeam, Ford and Dunlop closures, as well as the gossipy smallness of that conservative little city’s politics, made the Tánaiste's brand of politics. For me, this explains why he felt it was okay to leave so much of the country unrepresented at Cabinet and why a Government endowed with an unprecedented capacity to spend could patronise Cork so unfairly.",
                "The Tánaiste might rationalise that he was just doing what the Ross O'Carroll-Kelly-types did for Dublin in the last Government. In truth, he has just reproduced the hurt felt as a young Cork politician; reproduced it in other parts of the country, particularly the borders, the west midlands and the south east. In other words, in places that do not matter to this Government. This was the dark side of community that led the Tánaiste to renege on his promise to deliver 24-7 cardiac care to University Hospital Waterford, UHW, and to the people of the south east. The Tánaiste first met me when I was a protestor campaigning for this vital service. His fully broken promise restored a seat to his party in Waterford. Watching the Tánaiste and the Government sit on its hands during confidence and supply led me to stand for the people of Waterford and to promise to fight for this and other issues. We thought that having a party with the health portfolio and with our TD installed in the Department of Health, 24-7 cardiac care would finally be realised. Perhaps the Minister thought that too when he repeatedly turned up on Damien Tiernan's local radio show, renewing the forever broken promises of extended hours that have still not happened.",
                "As Maya Angelou wisely said, \"When someone shows you who they are, believe them\". The Tánaiste has shown us who he is and we have no reason not to believe."

In 2020, there were seven leadership debates three on RTÉ, three on Virgin Media and one on TG4 with some controversy obviously as our party leader was excluded from the initial debate. It is shocking that this has been reduced to two leadership debates altogether, with RTÉ having a monopoly. Does the Tánaiste believe that it is important that RTÉ and Virgin Media both host leadership debates during the election campaign as it is an important public service role for both our two main operators?"

Obviously, Covid interrupted training in Templemore and recruitment of gardaí and we would have loved to have recruited more gardaí. There are also other factors in terms of how cities will develop into the future. We need a much stronger residential footprint in cities now than was the case historically. Cities are changing in terms of the old anchor model with big department stores and so on. There is a lot of change going on. We need to invest in the public realm as we have. I just mentioned €170 million for the North Quays in Waterford. All of that will help in terms of a better public realm and better safety."

It has been turned into a hotel. When we campaigned to get social and affordable housing on that site, we were ignored but a Celtic tiger developer is now charging more than €200 a night on booking.com. For that people get a fold-out bed in a room the size of a disability car parking space and shared facilities in the area. It is an absolute scandal. This is one of the people who helped crash this economy and leave us with the legacy of the housing crisis. Why has that been allowed to happen under this Government's remit? The same people who crashed this economy because of greed over property are doing it again on a site that should be providing accommodation that is affordable for ordinary working people in this country."

Without consultation, and against the will of the people, the Government has forced International Protection Accommodation Service, IPAS, persons into these hotels. The Government has stopped them trading as hotels, which is hugely damaging to the economy. The fact is that there was no consultation whatsoever and the will of the people is being denied. People will have a chance to reflect on what the Government has done to them in three weeks' time. It is shameful the way Tipperary has been treated."

Ireland is a small, open economy which depends on free trade and fair trade. It is extraordinary that the House has not been in a position to ratify the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA. That tells its own story about a disconnect between this House sometimes and the economic realities of our country's lifeblood, which is trade. We export most of what we produce.",

                "Our small and medium enterprises, which are the backbone of our economy, particularly in smaller urban and rural areas, have faced particular challenges over the last few years due to increased costs. Many of those businesses fear for their viability into the future. Serious problems have now arisen for a large percentage of them in accessing the new power up grant of €4,000. The first increased cost of business scheme, ICOB, had 17 categories and paid 50% of the rates of a business. ICOB 2 paid 50% of rates as well but the 17 categories were reduced to two, namely, accommodation and food service, and wholesale and retail. Only the businesses that had classified themselves within those two categories in ICOB 1 got ICOB 2. The businesses within the other 15 classifications did not get any notification that they were ineligible for ICOB 2 and many did not follow up as, in many instances, only small payments were due because their rates bills were relatively small. Now, businesses that received ICOB 1 but not ICOB 2 are not eligible to apply for the much better power up grant of €4,000 announced in the recent budget. This is devastating for many businesses and must be changed. The Department must ensure that all businesses that got ICOB 1 get the power up grant. These businesses were not informed about the changes and they need this financial support. This morning, I received many calls from small businesses which put themselves in the classification they thought was right. There were 17 classifications and a business could easily fit into one of those categories. A decision was made at administrative level which is totally unfair. It must be changed immediately."

The power up grant now has a budget of €170 million. Qualifying businesses will receive a grant of €4,000. More than 29,000 retail and hospitality businesses have registered for the grant since it was launched on 24 October. In order to get payments to eligible businesses by the end of the year, the qualifying criteria for the power up grant are aligned with the ICOB scheme. As the Deputy said, there are two types and he is correct that the businesses that did not receive a second payment under ICOB are not eligible to register for the power up grant. It is my understanding that the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, has said this was being looked at within the Department with a view to seeing if we can do something to sort it out. The Deputy raised a fair point and it is one that needs to be examined."

On that fateful day, one of the children picked up an object which he thought was part of an engine but seconds later it exploded, as it was an unused shell from a tank. It killed three children and maimed many more. In September, thejournal.ie uncovered evidence that was not flagged at the time in terms of warnings from children who had previously done the same. None of those children ever received a State apology. Would the Government consider giving the children and families whose loved ones were killed on that day a State apology?"

He would inevitably come up with 2% of the eventual allocation of what he was looking for, but he always got it. Whether it was for a school on an island, a medical facility or whatever, he would always make a compelling case for it and I would suggest to Deputy Shanahan that perhaps he is a good role model in terms of leveraging from the system, working with Ministers and so on. He created an art form in terms of having that capacity.",

At the start of Government, it was put into a second batch while Cork and Dublin projects were progressed. All that stands there now are furze bushes and dandelions. There is also a hard no to the runway extension at Waterford Airport, where €25 million was promised by the Tánaiste's Government in 2007. Despite €500 million having been spent on national aviation, not a cent has been given to Waterford Airport in this programme for Government. I have a new slogan for the Tánaiste and the Government parties. They should say \"Airports 24-7, SETU for Waterford: all promised, nothing done, stand by for more promises.\""

Children's disability network teams, CDNTs, were set up throughout the country in 2021, but they are not working. The delay in addressing this crisis will have knock-on consequences on all of those children who require services and on their ability to live independently. Early intervention is key, yet the delay in this will mean that we are creating a significant level of dependency. As it stands, the number of applications overdue for completion for assessment of needs stands at 12,722 at the end of quarter 3. That is a 30% increase on the end of last year. The HSE is outsourcing the assessments of needs to private operators, private psychologists and so on, and the cost of that keeps rising as well. We are spending money on vital services but there is no oversight of it and the price keeps going up. There is not even a standardised assessment of needs process. Parents tell me that sometimes it only takes an hour and a half. For over €3,000, an hour and a half for an assessment of needs does not sound right to me. How will it be addressed?"

I believe a multidisciplinary school-led programme should be developed with multidisciplinary therapy teams in schools, beginning with special schools. I recall a time when special schools had therapists on-site and it worked. Progressing disability services was of the view that we should take them out of the special schools and have a broader service for a wider population, but what seems to have happened is that the service has been diluted and too much burden was placed on the CDNTs, which have large numbers. It is not simple but in my view, it clearly has not worked. I am making our commitments as a political party in respect of the multidisciplinary team-based approach in schools. That is a red line issue for me before I go into any other government again. There are issues on the clinical side and with clinical governance, which I get, but what is going on cannot be allowed to continue."

                "I have represented an urban community for 44 years now. In my last contribution, I will go back to and talk about my rural roots. I believe rural Ireland is at a moment of fantastic opportunity with the opening up of broadband, renewables, the opportunity for carbon management, the huge asset that is our towns and villages and the new direction coming from the national planning framework to kickstart that. It has been hugely fulfilling for me, in this, my final week, to be able to produce a document on the future of rural Ireland, something that we did with the Fine Gael policy lab. There is a real opportunity that needs to be seized. We need to nurture and enrich some of the phenomenal exemplars of good practice in the community, one of them remarkably led by a former person of this parish, Dr. Jerry Cowley in Mayo. We also need to reimagine the extraordinary assets in our towns and villages and engineer their delivery, as the Housing Commission has said. We need to create scope for more innovative leadership at local level. We need to have more conscious rural targets for electric vehicles and retrofitting.",
                "This is a moment of real opportunity. I hope whoever enters government will take this opportunity to heart and make a shift in the way the State thinks about leadership at a local level, because we are too centralised in the way we think. Every Government Department has to reorient how it regards local government and create new structures that will be more fulfilling for the future."

Sometimes there is a very negative narrative around rural Ireland but it is actually growing and I think technology is a great enabler. One thing I will say is I reacted at the time with dismay to the decision of our previous Government, of which I was not a member and was in opposition, to abolish town councils and town commissioners. Many towns that grew around the country had leadership at local level who had a vision for their town. In my own area, I think of towns like Kinsale or the Clonakiltys of this world where they had a vision locally and it worked. The town commissioners across the country worked, including many in Waterford, Lismore being one. It was in our document last time and I think all parties should have it if we are serious about it. Deputy Howlin was Minister at the time, or was in that Government, and he says he now regrets that decision.",

I thank Mr. Peter Finnegan and all the team for looking after us as Deputies and Ministers from all sides of the House and always in a very balanced way. No matter what level of service you look for in this House and no matter what angle it is, we are all treated equally which is the way it should be and again, part of the service we provide to our communities is enhanced by all the team here and the many levels as well. In particular, I think the Ceann Comhairle has many times, certainly when I held the housing brief, had to sit here night after night and listen to many of us repeat the same thing over again from both sides of the House, probably for a couple of years. Finally and thankfully, all those debates led to many positive changes in housing. This is only work in progress and we will build on it. Sometimes having to listen for hours and hours here does pay off for all us. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for his patience and courtesy to us all.",
                "I wish to raise two issues with the Tánaiste. Deputy Smith very clearly went through the categories of small businesses we have been trying to reach with supports from the schemes and I want to add to that. Every effort has been made by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment under the Minister, Deputy Burke, and Ministers of State, Deputies Calleary and Higgins, in trying to reach the businesses that need support. There were different analyses and reports done to feed into trying to choose the categories that need it but we have missed a couple of key categories. Deputy Smith outlined where the opportunity to categorise yourself might have been missed in the summer. Certainly, as we approach trying to reach businesses with supports, this scheme closes tomorrow for applications and it would be great to be able to extend it for a week or two to give some businesses a chance to reorganise that. We have to look at where we are with our SME community, however, not just with this scheme but going forward for any Government.",
                "Over the past three or four Governments, certainly the Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and Green Parties in this Government, have really reached out and tried to help small businesses at key times of crisis, be it covid, Brexit or the war in Ukraine. There were major interventions that were well received by business owners and that protected many thousands of jobs. I have no doubt about that but we are still going through a new phase. We have brought in many changes to labour laws, sick pay and many other areas that everybody agrees were right. There is no doubt about that. They were all right and nobody would take them back but we have to recognise it makes it difficult for small businesses we are all used to and that are a key part of our communities, be that the corner shop, the play and leisure sector, the tourism sector, the small coffee shop or restaurant. I am singling out small businesses because it is harder for them to absorb all these costs that will probably be there forever. These changes are there to protect workers and to give them greater rights. They absolutely need them but we must recognise that if we want these smaller businesses that do not have large HR departments or cannot afford to carry all those extra costs, we need to find new ways to permanently support that sector if we want it to remain in the way we are used to.",
                "We talk about rural Ireland and our communities where there are massive opportunities right throughout the country because this country is being run extremely well. We need to bear in mind, however, that we also want to hang on to those businesses and jobs we have always had because they are very often the first jobs all of us had as young people growing up. We need to find a category. There is no lack of desire to help them, I want to be clear on that. The political will is there but it is about being able to find a way that singles out these categories that need protection so we can then reach them with permanent supports and schemes going forward. I want to flag it now. There is a chance with this scheme but more generally, we need to bear in mind there are categories of businesses that need a different kind of permanent intervention if we are to protect them and keep them there for years to come.",
                "Again, I thank the people of Meath West and Meath who have supported me in votes and many other ways since 2002 and before that in the local authority and parts of Westmeath on occasion as well. I thank everybody for their support. It was a pleasure and an honour to represent them here."

Regarding the issue he raised, there is no doubt there has been an increase in the cumulative cost base of small businesses. That is a very real issue out there at present. Those various increases have all come together: the convergence of the minimum wage to the living wage by 2026, the guidance from the Low Pay Commission has been a factor and the various changes we have made. They are all coming together and it is therefore acknowledged and understood. The report he did at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment said it impacted most on the hospitality and retail businesses in particular. ICOB was designed to try to at least alleviate some of those pressures. The new power up grant is also designed to try to alleviate those pressures over the winter period. A total of 29,000 businesses have now signed up for the power up grant. There is €170 million to be made available to small businesses to try to alleviate the pressures put on them. It is an issue that needs constant attention by any new Government in the future, of that there is no doubt."

                "Credit Review is a body under the aegis of the Department of Finance. It was established by the Minister for Finance in 2010 under section 210 of the NAMA Act 2009, with the objective of facilitating access to bank credit for viable businesses. In the years since its establishment, Credit Review has proved an invaluable source of support and information for Irish SMEs. Its primary task is to provide an appeals service for SMEs that have had their applications for credit, up to €3 million, turned down by Irish banks, namely, AIB, Bank of Ireland and PTSB. It also publishes information notes for SMEs on topical issues and regularly gives expert advice on SME lending by banks to the Department and other stakeholders. It is a body with an annual budget under €500,000 and two and a half full-time equivalent staff members. Credit Review’s interactions with SME borrowers and banks provide valuable insights into SME performance and the market for lending, which are used by the Department.",
                "Since its establishment in 2010 and until the end of 2023, the Credit Review Service received 1,368 formal applications. Of these, 970 have reached a final conclusion, with Credit Review upholding appeals in favour of 579 borrowers. The upheld appeals resulted in banks agreeing to make €82.4 million in credit available to SMEs and farm businesses over those years. In addition to these many specific cases, Credit Review's interventions have led to improvements in practices within the participating banks. It is clear to the Government that Credit Review provides an important service to SMEs and farms throughout Ireland, in supporting them in the process to secure credit from banks.",
                "As I mentioned, Credit Review was set up under the NAMA Act 2009. Since that Act is under review, with a view to winding down NAMA by the end of 2025, the Government has decided it is appropriate to create a stand-alone legal basis for Credit Review, and ensure it continues its important work into the future. This is the purpose of the Credit Review Bill, which I am here to present today. The Bill: establishes the body to be known as the Credit Review Service on its stand-alone legislative footing, changing from the existing legal basis of the NAMA Act; replicates matters currently set out in regulations under the NAMA Act, namely, SI 127 of 2010; codifies procedures that have developed as practice over time; and provides a means to extend the functions currently provided by Credit Review to other regulated financial service providers, if the Minister for Finance considers it necessary.",
                "Throughout the development of this Bill, the aim has been to maintain Credit Review’s current functioning as far as possible. The Bill follows an important assessment carried out by the Department, which recognised the value that Credit Review provides to SME and farm borrowers and the wider lending environment. The Bill has been subject to consultations with a range of stakeholders, including the Central Bank of Ireland, my former home of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and many other industry and banking representatives, as well as Credit Review itself. The feedback on the proposed continuation of the services provided by Credit Review was positive from all stakeholders.",
                "As far as possible, and following on from the impact assessment and stakeholder consultations, the Bill seeks to maintain the current practices of Credit Review, when it becomes the Credit Review Service. I will briefly outline these practices before turning to the specific provisions of the Bill. The key role of the Credit Review Service is to help SME or farm borrowers who have had an application for credit of up to €3 million declined or reduced by participating banks, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition. It also looks at cases where borrowers consider that the terms and conditions of their existing loan, or a new loan, are unfairly onerous or have been unreasonably changed to their detriment. Further, the Credit Review Service acts as a mediator between those businesses and banks in a process ending with the service making non-binding recommendations to the bank. While the lender is not obliged to accept the recommendations, it must explain if it does not accept them. It is planned to maintain the status quo where Irish credit institutions, namely, AIB, Bank of Ireland and PTSB, participate in Credit Review Service appeals. The Bill also provides that the Minister for Finance can include other financial institutions in scope, if they are of sufficient significance in the Irish SME lending environment.",
                "Credit Review is fully financed by the participating banks and by nominal fees from businesses applying for reviews. This is intended to continue. The Credit Review Service also maintains a helpline for SMEs that offers expert guidance and can assist in resolving disputes prior to escalating to a formal appeal. Further, Credit Review Service officials report to the Department of Finance on their insights on trends in lending to SMEs and agricultural enterprises, which in turn supports policy formation by the Department and others. They also meet frequently with participating banks, trade organisations for SMEs and agriculture, as well as other State entities, to discuss these insights. This important role will be maintained.",
                "I will now outline the sections of the Bill. Credit Review is to be established as the Credit Review Service; in Irish, an tSeirbhís um Athbhreithnithe Creidmheasa. Sections 1 to 4, inclusive, provide for the Short Title, commencement, definitions that pertain to the Bill, the prescribed amount of a loan which may be subject to review, and the making of regulations. Currently, SMEs and farm borrowers can appeal to the Credit Review Service when they are turned down for a loan between €1,000 and €3,000,000. It is planned to maintain these thresholds. However, the Bill foresees the possibility to raise that limit to €5,000,000 in the future, if that is justified by the SME lending environment.",
                "Sections 5 to 7, inclusive, contain provisions in relation to service of notices and other documents and include a standard section on expenses, repeals and revocations.",
                "Sections 8 to 17, inclusive, outline the functions of the service, defines the roles and responsibilities of the credit reviewer and the service staff, outline procedures for his or her resignation, superannuation and removal from office, and address matters related to the engagement of consultants and advisers.",
                "Sections 18 to 24, inclusive, cover accounts and audit, the credit reviewer's appearance before the Committee of Public Accounts and his or her accountability to other Oireachtas committees. It sets out the obligation on the service to prepare an annual report, as well as other ad hoc reports, related to the functions of the service and a strategy statement covering a period of three years. Furthermore, it addresses the liability of the service and the credit reviewer in handling confidential information.",
                "Sections 25 to 27, inclusive, contain provisions relating to the review of credit decisions, lending practices and the activities of banks.",
                "Sections 28 and 29 set out how the Credit Review Service will be financed. The Minister for Finance is empowered to create regulations that permit the service to levy fees on SMEs and on banks. This will permit the current arrangement to continue. These fees and levies will ensure the service is fully self-financed. The SME fees will be nominal. Currently, these are linked to the value of the borrower's credit request and capped at €250. Banks in scope of the Bill finance the remainder of the service’s running costs, which are expected to remain modest, given the nature of its functions under this Bill. Enterprise Ireland provides the service with advances, office space, human resources, information technology services and seconded personnel, as outlined in a memorandum of understanding.",
                "Section 30 provides for the service, upon request by the Minister for Finance, to conduct a review of the provision of credit facilities to borrowers by in-scope banks and the effect of same on the availability of credit. In-scope banks shall provide relevant documents, aggregated data and commentary for the purpose of the review. Any information and documents provided by the banks are to be shared with the Minister for Finance. Furthermore, the service may request representatives of the banks and officers of the Minister to attend a meeting to discuss the information and documents provided. In addition to this primary purpose, the Bill proposes that the service will continue to provide advice to borrowers, and to the Minister and officials, on SME lending matters.",
                "Sections 31 to 38, inclusive, outline transitional provisions and contain consequential amendments to other enactments.",
                "This Bill is a largely technical endeavour to create a stand-alone legislative basis for the Credit Review Service, a body that has been in operation since 2010, providing valuable services to SME and farm borrowers. This Bill seeks to maintain, as far as possible, the status quo of how the Credit Review Service works. This will provide important stability to the users of the service, with the overall aim of supporting viable SMEs to access credit. The Government recognises the importance of SMEs to the Irish economy. SMEs provide the majority of jobs in the State and are a critical source of regional employment in towns and villages throughout the country. A key strategic priority for the Minister for Finance is a well-regulated, sustainable banking sector. This includes promoting access to credit for viable SMEs. The Credit Review Service is an important contributor to this priority and enabler of success.",
                "I look forward to responding to any interventions by Deputies. I commend the Bill to the House."

                "I welcome the publication of this Bill. It is coming in on Second Stage in the dying breaths of the Government, so the Bill will fall when the Dáil is dissolved tomorrow, but it can be restored to the Order Paper of the new Dáil. It is important to move ahead with it. I am conscious that there is a timing issue regarding this Bill, because it is interlinked with the ending of NAMA and the IBRC, which is in separate legislation before the Dáil. There is a suggestion that decisions had to be taken by the end of 2024 with the commission, with a full wind-up by the end of 2025, but that may be a separate matter.",
                "There are serious concerns regarding that legislation, and we hold those concerns. The point that was made to the finance committee is that we needed to get this through before the end of the year, and that it was a requirement from the commission, even though the wind-up would take another full year. We and others have expressed serious concerns at the committee that we would wind up NAMA, and, therefore, it would be beyond the reach of the Oireachtas and public scrutiny, despite the fact that we have a massive commission of investigation that is ongoing. In the last week, the deadline for that report, which was the end of October, has now been extended by a number of months into, I believe, June 2025. It is not appropriate, given the level of money that has come through NAMA, the fire sale of lands to support Government policy at the time and the losses that have been incurred as a result. There should be proper scrutiny of that. That legislation should not see the wind-up of NAMA until the commission's report is published and fully scrutinised. All the records of NAMA need to be maintained into the future in order for us to, if need be, delve further into them.",
                "There is no doubt, however, that when NAMA was established, it was provided with €74 million of loans. Even though it paid less for those loans, it is clear that it did not recover anywhere near the book value of those loans. If NAMA had managed them as is in the name of the organisation, the asset value underpinning those loans would have increased significantly, as they have done, and the State would be in a far better way. It is an example of the mismanagement, by Fine Gael in particular, of this arm of the State. We have not lost millions of euro this year; we have lost billions of euro. There are cases where land has been sold from NAMA to a developer and the land has been flipped. The flipping of that land a short while afterwards has resulted in an uplift to the developer of hundreds of millions of euro. I raise that because that legislation and this legislation are interlinked.",
                "The legislation gives a legal underpinning regarding the credit review office, which was established under the NAMA legislation of 2010 and provides it with a legal foundation. It does not really change, in any way, what is in existence and, therefore, we will support this legislation going to Committee Stage, if it is restored in the Thirty-fourth Dáil. It will then give us an opportunity to look into the legislation to see where it can be strengthened. As I mentioned, it is an office I have used on behalf of my constituents. I have not used it personally, but have signposted it for constituents in the past, particularly in the early days following its establishment and SMEs were finding it a bit more difficult. I have been signposting it less often recently. I have not looked at the numbers, but I will if we are in a position to scrutinise this legislation further on Committee Stage. The one weakness in all of this, and I recall one of the cases I asked to be referred to the credit review office, is after the examination, the office's view was the loan should be offered, and the bank in question, which I will not mention, said it that is all well and fine, but it would not loan the money and gave a reason. That is the weakness in all of this. The lending policies of banks are the lending policies of banks, but there is a weakness there. That being said, in other cases, there were reviews and the banks then provided the loan. This is an arm of the State that is better looked at than looked for. It has helped businesses, including ones in my constituency, throughout the years. We will look to see how we can strengthen that in the time ahead. It is a very small office. It only has a small number of full-time staff and a minimal budget, but Sinn Féin is happy to support this legislation to go on to the next Stage, where we will examine it further."

I thank the entire team for all of their support and assistance and service over the past 14 years. It has been a massive honour and a privilege to be part of the Oireachtas. Certainly, from the first day I came in here in February 2011, I always felt very welcome and everybody was incredibly helpful and supportive. There is a fantastic, dedicated team of people who come to work here in Leinster House every day, many of whom are doing it under the radar, behind the scenes and playing a massive part in this country's development and all of the good work that is happening in Ireland. I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for her courtesy and her fairness when she is in the Chair. I also acknowledge Deputy Seán Ó Fearghaíl, the outgoing Ceann Comhairle, who has been a fantastic Ceann Comhairle for the past nine years. He has done a great job and I wish everyone well in the future. I particularly thank the people of Kerry, who elected me to Dáil Éireann three times. It has been an enormous privilege to serve in the national parliament on behalf of County Kerry, first Kerry South, and then the entire county since 2016.",

I am sorry if there were things I did not get done. I am glad there were certain things I did get done. Many of us who are here realise that we are only ever passing through Dáil Éireann. We are only here for a while. We do our best while we are here and try to make as much of a positive contribution as we can. Again, I thank the people of Kerry for giving me that opportunity to represent them in Dáil Éireann.",
                "I also thank the Fine Gael Party and members of the Fine Gael party in County Kerry who have campaigned for me in five elections since 2004 at local and national level for their unwavering support over the years, as well as our team of public representatives and councillors in Kerry and former Senators, colleagues and TDs. Their support over the years was always huge.",
                "In particular, I want to thank my family and immediate family for their support always, my wife Róisín and two boys, Mícheál and Brendáin, who will hopefully be seeing a lot more of me from now on. When I came in here, I did not have any children. I am leaving here now with two little boys. They are 11 and nine and I am looking forward to being around for the remaining years of their childhood. It is something that has been a massive influence in terms of my decision to leave here. However, none of it could have been done without the support of my wife Róisín over the past 14 years, who made enormous sacrifices to enable me to be able to continue my career here. I am looking forward to having a normal life at home now over the next while.",
                "To everybody contesting the election, I wish them all very well. It is a difficult and stressful time for everybody, but it has never been as important that we have good people elected to this House into the future. I hope everybody who is contesting the election gets through the campaign safely and soundly. I ask that there would be decency for candidates on the doors. Everyone is stepping forward and basically putting their necks on the line to stand for public office, nearly always for the right reasons. I ask that courtesy would be shown to people who are standing for public office. It is a very difficult job to do. Putting his or her name forward for public office is the most public form of job interview a person will ever do. I hope the election will be fair and that there will be fair treatment of all candidates no matter what their party or non-party background is.",

Very often on television, people will see the conflict and the arguments and debates in here. Behind the scenes, however, what I leave here feeling most is that there are many friendships across the board and party divides and non-party divides. I leave here after 14 years with so many really good friends and having met so many very decent people who are in politics for the right reasons - to serve their country and serve the public. It has been an absolute honour and privilege to serve with those people as well."

This will guarantee the continuity of the industry funding model, formalise the governance structure of the service and support the enhancement of the credit review's responsibility. It will also provide the option to extend the credit review scope in the future subject to various consultation and other criteria to accommodate other financial service providers lending to the Irish SMEs and farmers that are not currently covered in the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009. I personally hope to see that empowered by the future Minister for Finance going forward. The legislation has been carefully drafted to avoid imposing an excessive burden on those concerned, and the primary aim is to maintain the status quo. I am pleased to present the legislation today. It will ensure that those SMEs that rely on the service can continue to do so. I again thank all Deputies and the Oireachtas committees for their contribution to the development of the legislation to date. I would particularly like to take a moment to thank the officials in the Department of Finance. This was not simple legislation. I know it is a brief debate today at the end of a Dáil term, but it was really difficult legislation that hours of work went into by dedicated public servants. Their work should be recognised in what is very important legislation.",

Regardless, however, I would like to extend my sincere thanks to all the people who work in this wonderful complex supporting our parliamentary democracy from the Debates Office, Bills Office, the ushers, catering staff and everyone else in between, as well as acknowledging the massive contribution of those colleagues who will not be back after the general election and those who perhaps will be back. To conclude, this is important legislation. I look forward to seeing further discussion on this Bill as it progresses through the House in the next format."

                    "I thank the Minister of State for being here to take this Topical Issue matter this evening. This is my second time in about a month to secure a debate with regard to Garda numbers in Roscommon and Galway. The falling number of gardaí is an issue I have raised consistently in this House, especially since January when we have had a spate of burglaries. They have been happening more or less all year long and are still sadly happening. I raised these issues with the Minister for Justice, the chief superintendent in my Garda division and the Garda Commissioner. Unfortunately, the Garda Commissioner does not respond, and the Minister said that Garda allocations are a matter for the Garda Commissioner, which I understand.",
                    "In the last month alone, I have attended a protest in Castlerea in County Roscommon by the newly formed Enough is Enough campaign group, which I commend. I then attended a public meeting held by the same group in Glinsk in County Galway on the same issue. On Sunday evening last, I attended a vigil in my home town of Ballaghaderreen. That vigil was about sending a message to the Government and the Garda Commission that we need more gardaí and we need to see them out on the beat.",
                    "When it comes to Garda numbers, figures can be deceiving. For example, in July last, I received a reply from the Minister advising me that there were eight gardaí in Ballaghaderreen Garda station. This week, I was advised there are four gardaí and one sergeant, a cut of almost half in less than four months. If there were five gardaí in Ballaghaderreen who were based in the town and out and about and visible, I would not be using the town as an example here this evening. In fact, if there were five gardaí in Ballaghaderreen, people would be happy enough if they were out and about and visible in the town but, unfortunately, they are not. As I always say when I raise issues concerning the Garda, this is not the fault of gardaí, who are under incredible pressure and stretched. This is not their fault. It is important to say that.",
                    "I have put it to the Garda Commissioner and the chief superintendent that we need a specific Garda plan for rural areas. The Government should support that proposal. Irrespective of who is in government in the new year, when the next Garda Commissioner is appointed he or she should come into office without a commitment that there will be a specific plan made for rural areas.",
                    "As the Minister of State will be aware, living in a rural area can mean living in a village or town where the Garda station has been closed. It can certainly mean living in a town where Garda numbers are down, as they are in all parts of my constituency of Roscommon and Galway. In County Roscommon alone, pre-Covid we had 171 gardaí, while today we have 146. The numbers are down. To live in a rural area can mean living in an isolated place or a village where you do not have immediate access to gardaí. The way of life is very different from that in our cities. That is why we need a specific Garda plan to focus on Garda allocations in our rural towns and villages.",
                    "I understand that approximately 167 gardaí are due to pass out of Templemore College in December. We need to see a number of those gardaí coming west. People are afraid. It is a great shame, in this day and age, that anyone would be afraid in their own home. I am thinking in particular of older people who live on their own. The fear they feel going to bed at night is one they should never have but the reality on the ground is that we simply do not have enough gardaí. I ask for the support of the Government and the Minister of State's party for a specific Garda plan for our rural areas."

Budget 2025 provided the highest ever allocation to An Garda Síochána. The funding allows for the continued recruitment of Garda members and staff and that should allow the Garda Commissioner to ensure that an effective policing service can be delivered in our towns and villages. The Department of Justice takes the safety of people living and working in rural Ireland very seriously and recognises that preventing crime does not just mean putting gardaí on the beat.",
                    "Supporting the work of the national rural safety forum, the Department published the rural safety plan. A lot has been achieved in the life of the plan which recognises that rural safety and community safety is not a job for An Garda Síochána alone. It requires a multi-agency, multi-sectoral and whole-of-Government response. The plan’s vision is to ensure people and communities in rural Ireland feel safe and are safe in their homes, places of work and local environments. The national rural safety forum is working to publish the second rural safety plan next year.",
                    "Deputy Kerrane will also be interested to note that local community safety partnerships are beginning to come on stream this year after very successful pilot partnerships in Longford, Waterford city and county and Dublin’s north-inner city. Chairpersons were appointed to eight LCSPs. The partnerships will replace and expand upon the remit of joint policing committees by providing a forum for residents and community representatives, with the relevant State agencies. Each partnership will be required to develop and publish a local community safety plan to reflect and respond to the needs of that community.",

Of course, the Department of Justice recognises that preventing crime in rural areas does not just mean putting gardaí on the beat but there lies part of the problem because we do not have gardaí on the beat. If that is part of the solution, and only part, we do not have them. That is the problem. We do not see our gardaí. In towns such as Ballaghaderreen and villages such as Glinsk, people do not see gardaí. The Garda station in Ballaghaderreen is typically closed, yet, according to the Department of Justice and the figures, there are four gardaí and a sergeant allocated to the town. Part of the problem is the fact that Ballaghaderreen is in a huge divisional area. It is part of Castlerea and Boyle, which were amalgamated in 2012, something I have asked the Garda Commissioner to review. It is an area stretching a distance in excess of 67 km and I understand that at night there are two garda cars covering the area. That is impossible to do.",
                    "The fact of the matter is the number of gardaí is falling. The number of gardaí has fallen in County Roscommon and the part of east Galway I represent in the Roscommon-Galway constituency. People are in fear. There have been numerous burglaries, especially this year. People are really worried and afraid in their homes. If we saw gardaí out on the beat, it would make a huge difference. I often refer to a meeting I attended last year in a town in my constituency at which gardaí told us that although the town has the worst antisocial behaviour problem in the county, they could only offer us a Garda checkpoint by the roads policing unit. They told us they did not have gardaí to put on the beat in the town with the worst antisocial behaviour problem in the county.",

An investigation team was established within Sligo-Leitrim, Galway and the Mayo-Roscommon-Longford divisions to identify members of this organised criminal group and associate them to particular burglaries. Three arrests were subsequently made in the Dublin region this week and a number of vehicles were seized and technically examined. A quantity of cash, designer items and a Rolex watch, suspected to be the proceeds of crime, were also seized.",

I am delighted that my county has been a major beneficiary of the sports capital programme allocations and also benefited from last week's announcement of €90 million in funding for the regional sports complex in Cavan.

Far too often in our public administration, there is too much administrative inertia and inaction instead of changing policy as needs and society change. Far too often, decisions are made on outdated criteria. I am speaking particularly in respect of the request by those running Scoil Phádraig Naofa in Shercock, County Cavan. They have formally requested the Department again to be included in the DEIS programme. The school authorities have outlined in great detail to the Minister, Deputy Foley, that the school serves a community that faces significant challenges like many other communities throughout the country. The school community, the board of management, the principal and her staff and the parents' association believe that DEIS status would greatly enhance their ability to support even better their students and families. Many of the students in Shercock, as the Minister of State will know representing a neighbouring area, come from backgrounds where English is an additional language. This presents unique barriers to their educational success. Additionally, like every other community, a number of families face particular challenges. The school very actively engages with the education and welfare officer, NEPS, the ISPCC, An Garda Síochána, Tusla and CAMHS in the best interest of the pupils. The school seeks and enlists the support of all the bodies that work on a daily basis with our schools. The school is very strongly of the opinion that without the additional resources and targeted programmes that are available through DEIS, their efforts will only go so far. The school community, the teachers and their support staff, most of whom I know, work very hard on programmes and initiatives to improve attendance and ensure that the pupils attain their best academic achievements possible. They believe that so much more would be done for so many more pupils if the resources of the DEIS programme were available to them.",
                    "As I said at the outset, the Pobal index is used to assess the need for delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, status. It does not accurately reflect the situation at schools such as St. Patrick's in Shercock or the unique challenges students face in particular communities. The community in Shercock experiences high levels of mobility, with many families moving in and out as parents seek employment in nearby factories. Thankfully, there is huge employment in that particular area. This transient nature can lead to under-reporting in census data that may not capture the full extent of the needs of students who have recently moved to the area, particularly the additional demand on a student and parents in regard to their lack of proficiency in the English language. When DEIS was last reviewed, the pupils' eircodes were not even inputted to the primary online database at the time. The Department should give urgent consideration to the request of Scoil Phádraig Naofa to be included in the DEIS programme. All of us in this House could identify other schools but this particular case I am putting forward today is on behalf of St. Patrick's national school, Shercock which merits urgent consideration as per the detailed submission made by the school."

Universal supports are available to all schools to enable them to support students at risk of disadvantage. The Minister, Deputy Foley, has secured approximately €170 million in funding to provide free school books as a universal support to all primary and post-primary schools in the free education scheme. Since 2020, the Minister has provided three improvements to the teacher allocation schedule to allow for smaller class sizes in primary schools. As part of the capitation package in budget 2025, more than €30 million was secured as a permanent increase in capitation funding to help schools, now and longer term, with increased day-to-day running costs. This represents an increase of approximately 12% on current standard rates and enhanced rates. This increase is on top of the circa 9.2% increase from last year.",
                    "Supplementing the universal supports available to all schools, the DEIS programme is a key policy initiative of the Department to address concentrated educational disadvantage at school level in a targeted and equitable way across the primary and post-primary sectors. The programme is targeted at schools with the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage. Schools that were included in the programme in 2022 were those with the highest levels of concentrated disadvantage as identified through the refined DEIS identification model. Schools were not required to apply for inclusion in the DEIS programme and the model was applied fairly and equally to all schools.",
                    "The extension of the programme to new schools is just one component of work in the Minister’s vision for an inclusive education system. While the DEIS programme supports those schools with the highest levels of concentrated educational disadvantage, the Minister also recognises that there are students at risk of disadvantage in all schools. The Minister invited the OECD Education for Inclusive Societies project to review the current policy approach for the allocation of resources to support students at risk of disadvantage in Ireland. This review was published this year, and it found that while Ireland has a comparatively equitable education system, and the DEIS programme is a key instrument in that, gaps remain. The review finds that Ireland has an education system that consistently outperforms many other OECD countries but also exhibits relative socioeconomic fairness, making it one of the stronger performers globally. It also recognises the positive impact of resources provided universally to all schools, as well as the additional resources provided to schools in the DEIS programme, in addressing disadvantage. The review also highlights continued improvements over the past decade in retention and attainment levels between children and young people in DEIS and non-DEIS schools. It notes that, even with these improvements, important differences in outcomes persist between DEIS and non-DEIS schools and for children and young people from disadvantaged backgrounds, and Travellers and Roma. This information and data has also informed the Traveller and Roma education strategy, published in July. The findings and recommendations of the OECD review will help inform future policy in the area of addressing educational disadvantage."

The model in Cavan relating to the large-scale infrastructure sports application had Cavan County Council, Cavan GAA and the Royal School collaborating and putting forward a project that brought the entire community together. It is extremely important in all walks of life. We could learn from having more collaboration across sectors, sports, etc.",
                    "I very much appreciate what the Minister for Education did. I know from school authorities who speak to their local public representatives about the benefits DEIS has brought in extra teaching resources and supports that are made available for children. We have an excellent community in Shercock. Thankfully, there is massive employment in the town, catering for a big area. We have a community with a very good football club that has great facilities. We also have an athletics club that is renowned throughout Ireland’s athletic community for the quality of its facilities. People have again worked very hard to put those facilities in place and ensure people are accommodated and given an opportunity to participate in their particular sport, in this case, athletics.",
                    "That community wants to ensure, as does the leadership in the primary school, that all children are given the best opportunity to reach their best educational attainment. We all know how impactive a good primary school education is for the future of children. In this case, where there is huge mobility and so many families whose first language is not English and additional challenges arise, consideration must be given to the inclusion of such schools in the DEIS programme. I again make the point that far too often we make decisions based on outdated strategies. A strategy may be very progressive and forward looking but things change much more rapidly in Ireland today than they ever did in the past, given the movement of people and the increase in population. There are new challenges that perhaps were not there ten or 12 years ago. The DEIS programme is of great benefit to so many pupils, schools and school communities throughout the country.",

In the meantime, access for the owners of the property, the Office of Public Works, OPW, is denied by virtue of a neighbour having decided to change an arrangement that had been in place when the previous landowner was in situ. Access to the house and its 200 acres, including for maintenance, has been suspended and is denied, and the public are massively discommoded. Lest it be forgotten, it is our duty to raise this issue in every way and at every time possible to ensure the State will be fully informed of its obligations as the caretaker of a national monument such as this, not only in Castletown but throughout the country, and of the need to protect, preserve and maintain such monuments.",

While that should have been done at least a year ago, it shows progress and demonstrates a recognition in the OPW that there has to be a solution. There is no sense in introducing a temporary arrangement or a solution that will suffice only until something else happens, or a reversionary lease, or a lease that is subject to somebody's whim to change from time to time.",

If it should so happen that matters are legally resolved in the meantime, so much the better, but it is important at this stage to ensure we will continue to pursue the matter indefinitely. Needless to say, we will try to continue to do so through this Dáil and into the next one if we are lucky enough to be returned to this House."

While, if agreement can be reached, this would resolve the issue of temporary staff access, the Minister of State and the OPW continue to engage on finding broader solutions to access to the Castletown estate. They want to find a solution for visitor parking and are continuing to consider and work on all options, including M4 access.

Despite the best efforts of the OPW, however, the State was outbid and, ultimately, the lands were acquired by a private buyer. It continues to be the strategic objective of the OPW to reunite all the lands. The agency remains open to negotiations with the landowners to purchase all or part of the subject lands. In line with a commitment the Minister of State gave to the working group, he met the owners to discuss this further, and engagement will continue.",

                    "I am raising the issue of gaps in home care provision because it is having a detrimental effect on the everyday lives of people, whether elderly or disabled. I am contacted regularly by family members of older people and disabled people who have been approved hours that are not being filled. This is where a home care package has been put in place, the person has been assessed and the hours required are approved, but they are not being filled. This happens regularly. For example, I was talking last week to a young man, Finn, who is almost 23 years of age. He has a condition called Duchenne muscular dystrophy and his mother, a single parent, is his sole carer. He has been approved for a package for seven days a week, twice a day, where two carers are to come in to get him up in the morning and change him for the day, and then are to return to put him back to bed at night. Invariably, carers do not turn up or only one will turn up when two are required, given it requires two people to turn him. This means the mother has to ask a neighbour or friend to come in and while those neighbours and friends do not mind, they may not always be available, and she should not have to rely on that sort of help on an ongoing basis.",
                    "The mother states that some of the carers are directly employed by the HSE. They come in during the week and they are generally reliable, they are trained, they know what they are doing and they stay the length of time they are supposed to. However, the HSE also relies on an agency to provide care for an amount of the time. She says that it is no exaggeration to say that 20 different people have been through her door, and they are not trained or even informed of Finn’s care needs. One carer came in and tried to move him from the back of the neck, not knowing that he has a rod in his spine. He was hurt and spent two weeks in considerable pain. The mother said this agency is not reputable, although she did not say that about all agencies. The HSE needs to review the agencies it is employing to provide the care. Preferably, I would like to see the HSE directly employing carers so this situation does not arise.",
                    "A 34-year-old lady, Lindsay, has locked-in syndrome and can only move her eyes following a stroke. She has an intensive care package of three visits a day from carers, seven days a week, with three carers at a time being required. Her parents are her carers. Again, invariably, only one or two of the carers turn up and it is not sufficient, so she is not getting the care she needs.",
                    "When I write to the HSE about this and other cases, I am given an outline of the care package approved but am told that the carers are not available. That is not good enough. People with the most need have to be prioritised so they get the care they require. We cannot have people left for a whole weekend. Finn’s mother was telephoned last Friday at 4 p.m. to be told there were no carers for the weekend. When she tried to call back, she could not get through to anyone. Sometimes the lines are only open for two hours a day and it might be that nobody answers or returns calls.",
                    "People are being left high and dry. It is a huge issue that is preventing people from going into nursing home or residential care. To be kept in their own home is their preference but it also saves the State money. While the care packages can be expensive, they would not be as expensive as if this person had to receive round-the-clock care in a nursing home. They should be facilitated to stay in their homes and given the proper care by trained professionals, who show empathy and understanding and act in a professional manner. That is not happening on an ongoing basis and families are at their wits' end."

Nonetheless, there is actually more home care taking place. To give the exact position in Cavan, 724 people there are availing of home support services. The waiting list is currently at 146 people and, of those, 26 people on the list have no care and are waiting for their package to start. The remaining 120 people have care but are seeking more care, or perhaps staff are not available.",

This year, we expect the total number of hours to be 662,000, which is 9% above the target. I accept what the Deputy says with regard to the deficits that exist, but this figure suggests 50,000 more hours this year than last year.",

While there is a significant level of service provision across the area, demand continues to grow. The HSE recently reported that Cavan and Monaghan had a rolling campaign for the recruitment of healthcare assistants for home support. Since 2021, 88 new healthcare assistants for home support provision have been employed across Cavan and Monaghan and there is now a panel in place for healthcare assistants following interviews in April.",

Rather than having them go into homes, we prefer to see people make the choice to stay in their own homes and receive the care they need. It is recognised that they need the care, and they have been assessed and approved for the hours, but those hours are just not being filled. There is a crisis in the home care sector. A further recruitment campaign is needed, as well as proper training for individuals who are going to take up that work. I believe there are people in the community willing to do that work but pay and conditions are an issue. There is a difference between the pay and conditions of someone who is directly employed by the HSE and someone employed by an agency, and we need to fill that gap. Home care providers are often driving around rural areas, such as Cavan, where some of the roads and lanes they have to travel are very poor, but they get nothing towards travel, which is another issue.",
                    "It was also brought to my attention in September that homecare providers in CHO 1, of which Cavan is a part, were told that a recent pay and numbers letter had been issued, based on directives from the CEO and CFO, and with immediate effect, there would be no increase in hours implemented unless they are reallocated from previously ceased hours.",

There seems to be a pull-back here because of money in not providing this essential care that people need in the community. That is very serious. We cannot have a blunt instrument where we cut people off and tell them we are not giving any more money, whether people need it or not. People have to be assessed to ensure they are given the hours they require to live comfortably and safely in their own homes.",

As I said, the number of hours this year is 10% higher than we budgeted for and it is approximately 9% higher than what was provided in 2023, so there are a lot more hours available. There have been some improvements, including the new HSE authorisation scheme for home support, which has been in place since August, for payments to approved private and voluntary providers to deliver home support on behalf of the HSE. This delivers on commitments for sectoral reform, such as payment for travel time for home support providers, paying carers the national living wage at a minimum, and bringing legacy rates into line with the new revised rates of funding. We think this will help. This is work that has been done under this Government. I know there is a lot more to do but we have recognised some of the points the Deputy has raised and taken steps to address them. However, we need to do more; there is no question about that and we certainly want to do so."

                "I am very pleased to present to the committee a draft sectoral employment order for the construction sector. The draft order proposes to amend the previous SEO made in 2023 by confirming new minimum rates of pay, pension and sick pay entitlements for workers in the construction sector. If approved, the order will be the fifth of its kind to be made since the first SEO for the construction sector was issued in 2017.",
                "Before I detail the specifics of the order, I remind us all of our respective roles, including mine as Minister of State and that of committee members, as Members of the Houses of Oireachtas, in terms of the SEO process. An SEO is a statutory minimum wage-setting mechanism in a given economic sector. In essence, an SEO is a collective bargaining mechanism which, once the statutory threshold has been met, gives the Labour Court, as a neutral decision-maker, the power to examine an application for an SEO in a given economic sector. As part of this examination, the Labour Court must explore all the policy considerations set out in the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015 by affording all interested parties an opportunity to engage with the proposals and have an opportunity to be heard. Once the Labour Court has complied with the statutory process set out in the 2015 Act, it then has the power to make a recommendation for an SEO to me. This recommendation must be accompanied by a report setting out the process and matters the Labour Court considered in reaching its recommendation. The purpose of the report is to assist with satisfying the Minister that the Labour Court has complied with its statutory functions under the Act.",
                "My role in this process, as Minister of State, is quite limited. Pursuant to the 2015 Act, I have the power to either accept or reject the recommendations presented. I am compelled to accept the recommendations if I agree, based on the statutory report the Labour Court has prepared, that the court has complied with the statutory process. If I, as Minister of State, am not satisfied that the Labour Court has complied with its duties as set out in the Act, I would have to return the proposal to the court setting out the reasons for not accepting the recommendation. To be clear, I do not have any power to engage with the substantive recommendation itself. I receive the recommendation and either approve or reject it.",
                "I confirm to the committee that I have considered this draft recommendation in line with the terms of the 2015 Act, relying on the statutory report outlining the Labour Court's deliberative process. Having done so, I am satisfied that the Labour Court has complied with its statutory role. Accordingly, my Department has notified the Labour Court that I accepted the recommendation and would be referring the matter to the Houses of the Oireachtas, as required by the Act, for their consideration. Furthermore, as required, a draft order was laid before the Houses. The 2015 Act also sets out that the Houses of the Oireachtas may only accept or reject the draft order as it is. The Act does not permit any alterations or amendments from the committee to the draft order. If the Houses accept the recommendation, I will then sign a statutory instrument to give it effect. I am keen to do so before the dissolution of the Dáil. Should the Houses reject or fail to approve the draft order, the proposal for the SEO would then fall.",
                "I turn now to the proposal itself. The application for an examination came before the Labour Court by way of application by the Building and Allied Trades Union, Connect Trade Union, Operative Plasterers and Allied Trades Society of Ireland, OPATSI, SIPTU and Unite the Union. They did so pursuant to section 14 of Chapter 3 of Part 2 of the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2015.",
                "The five unions requested that the Labour Court examine the terms and conditions relating to the remuneration and any sick pay scheme or pension scheme, of all persons employed in the construction sector as craftspeople, construction operatives, and apprentices. Having examined the submissions and the accompanying supporting material, the Labour Court reports that it was satisfied that the applicants were substantially representative of the workers of the particular class, type or group in the economic sector in respect of which the request is expressed to apply. This gave the court the jurisdiction to proceed with the examination.",
                "The court then, as it is required to do, published its intention to undertake an examination of the unions’ request and invited submissions from interested persons. Written submissions were received from three interested parties. They were the construction industry committee of ICTU, the Construction Industry Federation and Connect Trade Union. No parties objected to the making of an SEO. These submissions will be made available for anyone to examine on the Labour Court’s website.",
                "A public hearing was then held on 6 August of this year and again on 9 September. All interested parties were given an opportunity to be heard and to engage with the various policy considerations that the process requires. Having considered the matter fully within the statutory time limits, the Labour Court then made its recommendation to me. According to its report, the court has considered the factors set out in section 16(2) of the Act. This includes the potential impact of the making of an order on levels of employment and unemployment in the identified economic sector, the potential impact on competitiveness in the economic sector concerned and that the SEO would be binding on all workers and employers in the economic sector concerned. I understand that the Labour Court’s report has been shared with members of the committee, so I hope they have had the opportunity to examine it themselves in greater detail. I confirm that it will be made available on my Department’s website.",
                "I hope the committee will recognise the importance of ensuring industrial relations stability in the construction sector and will accept the order in its draft form. I trust that the committee recognises that Ireland needs a competitive, productive and sustainable construction sector for the delivery of high-quality and affordable residential and commercial properties alongside its national physical infrastructure. I believe this SEO plays a really significant role in supporting this sector through the maintenance of harmonious industrial relations. The terms of the SEO refer merely to the minimum rates of pay and terms and conditions, so it is a floor. At times when the sector is buoyant, it is expected that most employers will exceed these minimum rates. The real importance of the SEO is to ensure that in times of economic downturns, workers are properly protected and the sector maintains its attractiveness as a profession for apprentices in particular.",
                "It has been a long-standing practice of trade unions and the employers in the construction sector to enter into collective agreements that govern the terms and conditions of employment. These arrangements have been in place for many decades and have provided the industry with cost certainty and stability. The original SEO provides for a dispute resolution mechanism, which does help when it comes to preventing industrial unrest.",
                "Should this order be approved by the members, I will sign an order giving it legal effect. Its terms will be binding across the entire economic sector. The new order will become effective on 1 August 2025. It will remain in place for two years and includes a second minimum remuneration increase in August 2026. I will hand over to members."

I speak to people within the trade union movement on a very regular basis and while it is not massively widespread, there are pockets of noncompliance with the SEO. It is not just in construction but we are talking about construction this morning. Could the Minister outline for us how this is going to be enforced? The best way for any worker to enforce an SEO is to be a member of and be active in his or her trade union, and ensure he or she has his or her rights at work vindicated. However, we are also sitting here knowing that trade union density in the construction sector is not huge. With regard to making sure the Minister of State lives up to that statement, if it is binding across the sector, can she outline for us the steps that will be taken?"

That means an inspector will work with the employer to ensure that the employer fulfils all of its statutory obligations, and that any outstanding wages or entitlements are given to workers. The inspectorate division of the WRC carries out inspections of employer records with a view to determining compliance with employment rights legislation, effectively. These inspections are in response to complaints received of alleged non-compliance with relevant employment rights legislation. They arise as part of compliance campaigns, which focus on compliance in specific sectors, or with specific pieces of legislation. They also arise from routine inspections, both announced and unannounced, which act as an overall control mechanism.",

We know this is going to be very well communicated to the sector. The sector has a legal obligation and we expect it to have these minimum rates. On top of that then, we have a situation where the WRC can carry out inspections. It should be noted that while the WRC inspectorate does not currently have the powers to enforce the terms of the statutory orders, it goes in and has the powers to see what is happening in that company. Employees whose rights under a wage-setting mechanism have not been complied with are then referred to the adjudication service of the WRC for investigation. Dispute resolution, under SEOs, provides for access to the WRC's adjudication service. That specific division is for individual complaints and disputes. Then, the WRC conciliation service is there for collective disputes as well, and obviously an appeal is available on application to the Labour Court. Notice, in writing, of a dispute should be given to an individual and to their trade union as well, and it can be progressed that way."

I do not believe that it is but there are pockets of noncompliance. We are talking about the absolute bare minimum here. This people are not on massive money. We are talking about very modest wages and the absolute minimum. Is the only option open to a worker, where they find they are working in a noncompliant organisation, to take an individual case to the WRC?

I have to declare a personal interest; I have a son who is entering his third year of an apprenticeship. My concern, which Deputy O'Reilly put well, is that if it is left to an individual to make a complaint about non-compliance with an SEO, the reality, as I know from my work on the ground as a trade union official, is that the person will be fired. That is what happens. I would respectfully suggest that the Government has to come up with a way and means of enforcing the SEO that does not fall on individual workers, because that is the issue.",

There are sites in Limerick where subbies basically say that if someone wants a job, they can come in self-employed or else they are not coming in. That is happening today. I have spoken to people who have faced that. It is really widespread. My question is about enforcement, and a related question is where we are with the number of workplace inspection employees at the moment and what the target is."

The Department of Social Protection, where I am a Minister of State, has a division that organises construction expos annually. These are targeted at people on the live register and early school-leavers to encourage them to take up apprenticeships. The expos are really successful. We had one in Tallaght last year and the year before. It was highly successful and there was a great buzz around it, in addition to great energy. Many transition year classes attend to see it in action. It is great to see engagement at this level to encourage people to become apprentices. SOLAS does a huge amount in this area and I will certainly pass the Deputy’s feedback on to it. I agree that we absolutely need a sustainable apprenticeships model.",

Anecdotally, I have heard that the cost of tools, for example, might be prohibitive, depending on the employer. Therefore, I have asked the Department to carry out a review of the feedback from those who drop out of apprenticeships. If people enter careers that are just not for them, there is nothing we can do about it, but if there are things the Government can do to support people to stay in apprenticeships longer, it absolutely will do them."

A complement of 90 was recommended in 2006 as part of the Towards 2016 agreement. Many more people are at work today than there were then, yet our number of inspectors is effectively half of what it was then. The repercussions of this for workers are really serious. The Minister of State referred to this in terms of the bogus self-employment issue I referred to.",

I do not expect the Minister of State to know off the top of her head the highest number of inspectors her Department has had over the past four years, but I would like to know that figure. My random guess is that it is nowhere near 80. This is just not good enough. People are not getting the protections and support they need in the workplace. We know there are major issues in the area we are talking about today, namely construction. I want a follow-up on that particular point, and that will be it."

                "IDS-TILDA examines ageing among people with an intellectual disability aged 40 years and over in the Republic of Ireland. It is the first study of its kind in Europe, and the only study in the world with the ability to compare ageing in the general population with data yielded by TILDA. The study commenced in 2008 and one of its key strengths is its ability to track initiatives and reforms intended to support change in the lives of people with an intellectual disability. We have seen that there has been a number of important achievements during this period. Our first report, in wave 1 in 2008, reported that 47% of participants lived in residential or congregated settings. By wave 5, in the overall population this figure had reduced to 28.5%. The change was even more dramatic when we looked at those aged 40 to 50 years. In wave 1, almost 45% of participants in this age category lived in residential or congregated settings. By wave 5, this had dropped to 7.7%. Our data supports that continuing to deliver on movement to and engagement in the community must continue to be a key priority. We have found that quality of life is lower for people living in congregated settings than those living in the community and those living in the community are less likely to have choice and self-agency across many life domains. We are aware that around 2,000 people continue to live in congregated settings so we need to continue to work on that.",
                "We have found increases, as compared with wave 1, in the proportion of participants who had regular contact with both their family and friends, more people living full social lives with rich interpersonal relationships and engaged in their communities. Again, the most notable increases were among those less than 50 years of age, those with mild intellectual disability and those living in the community.",
                "This is good news but many barriers and concerns remain. People with more severe intellectual disabilities, those living in residential or congregated settings, remain dependent on staff for support. Staff are really important in their lives. There is a huge crisis in the recruitment and retention of staff. This is a major issue in terms of the security and well-being of many people with severe to profound intellectual disability.",
                "Approximately 20% of participants reported not leaving their house at all. For some, this was a personal choice. However, others - one in five in this group - reported this was due to a lack of staff or resources to get out of their home.",
                "The findings of IDS-TILDA continue to highlight high rates of often manageable or preventable physical health problems, including chronic constipation in about 50% of this population, high levels of poor bone health, for example, osteoporosis which is often undiagnosed, and a high incidence of falls and fractures, all of which we know impact hugely on quality of life and increased risk of mortality.",
                "Medication use remains higher, with patterns of prescribing substantially different from those observed in the older population by TILDA. Although we have seen a decrease over time in the use of some medications, particularly in those under 50 years, overall levels of polypharmacy and hyper-polypharmacy, which is the use of ten or more drugs, at 21%, are much higher than in the general population, at 2%.",
                "IDS-TILDA is also shining a light on poorly understood diseases in areas such as oral health, women’s health and cancer. Cancer was infrequently diagnosed across the five waves, yet it was one of the leading causes of death recorded on death certificates. We are not identifying cancers in a timely manner, which would offer people with intellectual disabilities the opportunity to avail of new therapeutics and treatments. There is also a limited understanding of their experience of survivorship.",
                "We have also shown that women with an intellectual disability die, on average, 20 years earlier than women in the general population and they have much poorer levels of physical and mental health. Menopause occurs at an earlier age and, indeed, earlier again for women with Down's syndrome, yet many were unaware of menopausal transition. Very few had spoken to anybody about this and over 80% of them did not receive information they could readily understand. This is an area that really needs to be examined.",
                "The IDS-TILDA study on oral health revealed stark inequalities, with high rates of oral health disease and a lack of access to essential dental care. Two in five participants aged over 65 were edentulous, which means they had no teeth at all. This rate far exceeds the rate in the general population. Of those without teeth, 70% lacked dentures compared with 5% in the general population, so they were orally disabled. Over 70% lacked functional dentition, affecting smiling and their ability to eat and chew food. Oral disease was prevalent, with nearly half of participants having cavities, two thirds experiencing swollen gums and only a quarter having clean mouths. Dental anxiety was high and although most had seen a dentist recently, these visits were often for assessment without treatment.",
                "There is a fivefold increased risk of people with intellectual disability, particularly those with Down's syndrome, developing dementia compared with the general population. We know that for people with Down's syndrome aged over 65, the risk of developing dementia is almost 80%. This compares with a risk of between 4.8% and 8.6% among those aged 65 years and older in the general population. The risks are, therefore, very different.",
                "IDS-TILDA, when it comes to translation, has driven the model of dementia care in Ireland with the establishment of the national intellectual disability memory clinic, which gives everyone in Ireland a chance to access memory screening, assessment and post-diagnostic advice. I acknowledge the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Mary Butler, and the national dementia office for listening to the advice, taking it on and building a world-class memory clinic at Tallaght University Hospital.",
                "We are working hard on areas like brain health. We must tackle things like brain health and create prevention programmes. We are positioned to engage in much-needed clinical trials for this increasingly at-risk group in our population.",
                "More generally, our health findings support an approach that focuses on diagnosis and prevention: health promotion; the creation of care pathways and capacity building within mainstream health services; and the creation of disability-friendly hospitals and healthcare environments that truly understand and embrace what reasonable adjustments look and feel like. This will benefit not only people ageing with an intellectual disability but everyone in society. Failing to adopt such an approach may result for many in a return prematurely to institutional care and the congregated settings they have left or, even more concerning, a move into long-stay nursing homes which are often ill-suited to meet their needs due to a lack of disability-specific knowledge and training among staff. We have demonstrated this trend, with lack of resources, increasing costs and lack of capacity among the workforce, as the key driver to transfer to more supported settings.",
                "IDS-TILDA has also been examining how the family caregiving landscape in Ireland has continued to change.",
                "Decongregation and an increased reliance on family caregivers are challenged by smaller family sizes and the progressing age of parent carers, people with intellectual disabilities and, to some extent, siblings, of whom we have seen many. This raises serious questions regarding the sustainability of care for older people with intellectual disabilities in the coming decades.",
                "For participants in the IDS-TILDA caregivers' study, we have seen a growing generational transfer of care from parents to siblings, but many of those siblings said they were the last remnant of care and that they would not transfer that care responsibility to their family members. Although most carers strongly agreed or agreed that providing care made them feel needed, feel useful and appreciate life more, they frequently cited being constantly on call and the stress and emotional strain as difficult. Many found the role confining and expected to be still providing at least the same level of care in five years, and many of them were in their 70s or 80s. Carers expressed a lack of confidence that the State would look after their adult family member when they themselves could no longer do so. Carers’ allowances and respite services were acknowledged as helpful, but there is not a comprehensive set of supports needed for caring to continue, nor are alternatives available when caring cannot be sustained in the family home.",
                "IDS-TILDA demonstrates that the lives of people with intellectual disabilities have improved, sometimes dramatically, especially in younger age cohorts. This is particularly true for those with mild and moderate levels of intellectual disability, but not so for those with a severe intellectual disability nor for those living in residential care. Much more work is needed, particularly to address preventable and treatable mortality. IDS-TILDA is documenting the changes in lives and continuing challenges in ways that no other survey can or does. We now have the strongest data in the world on the physical and social determinants of health and well-being for people with intellectual disabilities as they age. Let us use it wisely to inform policy and the necessary supports to ensure people with intellectual disabilities can age with dignity and pride.",
                "I hope we have learned from the history of our past, a past when people with intellectual disabilities were segregated from their communities. We must not give up on the hard-fought gains we have made within the disability sector. A premature return to institutional care is a serious breach of Article 19 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Instead, our focus should be driven by the belief our work with people with intellectual disabilities is about not just adding years to life but equally, and critically, adding life to years.",
                "We are grateful for the support we have received from the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, as well as from previous Ministers and various Departments, the Health Research Board, the HSE clinical leads and the National Federation of Voluntary Service Providers, with which we so work so closely. Most critically, people with intellectual disabilities themselves have shaped our understanding of their ageing."

I would like to get a feel for how we go about that.",

She said something like 50% of women with disabilities were unaware of the transition. How do we approach that? It seems to be an area that needs further examination. How is it monitored and how did we get to that figure?",

Community settings are far better than congregated settings and give us far better outcomes. People who engage in the community tend to have better lives and live longer. Whether they go to church, the pub, a football match or something else, it seems to prolong a lot of people’s lives. I do not know whether there are other areas that can be addressed to improve the longevity of people with disabilities. I understand people with Down's syndrome die much younger than other people. Are we making progress on extending their lives by introducing different methods and putting them into proper accommodation instead of residential accommodation? I always feel you are better off remaining in your community. Will Professor McCarron give us her thoughts on that?"

                "There were a lot of questions there but I might start with the last one, about people with Down's syndrome. The ageing of people with intellectual disability is something to be celebrated. This is the first time in history when people with intellectual disabilities have lived to old age. In the 1930s, somebody with Down's syndrome could be expected to live to about 12 years old. Now people are living longer, simply because of better care, interventions, social care, education and all the other things we know are important, but they are still dying earlier than the general population and are at high risk of Alzheimer's disease, in particular. We need to be ambitious for continued longevity and ensure that, as people age, they will continue to live in good health. Moreover, many people are presenting with more complex issues well before the age of 65. Our gerontological services and so on often talk about access over the age of 65. One issue we need to look at is the use of chronological age in terms of access, whereas it should really be based on need. Those are some important issues for us to consider.",
                "As for future-proofing services, when our decongregation started, people with higher levels of intellectual disability remained in congregated settings and we moved people with higher functioning levels out into the community first. When we moved them, it was often with no staff support during the day and there were no staff there at night. Now, as they begin to develop conditions of older age, often 20 years earlier than the general population do, we do not have the infrastructure or resources to address the changing needs. Often, for people who have been moved from the family home into a congregated setting and then out into the community, at a time in their life when they are most vulnerable, they are then moved back into perhaps a bigger congregated setting than that which they moved out of. We really need to understand how we are going to support people to age in the home of their choice independently with supports in the community of their choice. That is a big issue and the commission on care will certainly be looking for older people and examining some of those issues.",
                "When it comes to family caregiving as well, we have to understand that the majority of people live at home with families. Many of these families are ageing. There is often no plan as to how their family member will be supported. Often when that parent or sibling passes away, it is a crisis issue. Not only do the people with intellectual disabilities lose their parent or family member who is their primary carer, they lose their house. They lose their community. They are moved out of everything so they have a multiple of losses. We need to understand. Very few residential placements are coming up. We see the waiting list that there is. We need to understand what the model of care and what mobility options will look like and how we continue to support parents who need support. When people have done lifelong caregiving, we also need to ensure that there is future planning and that there is some place for people to transition into should that happen or else that services are enabled to support that person to continue to live in the family home should that be the case. They are some of those critical issues.",
                "In terms of menopause, menopause occurs early. There are many reasons for this. It occurs much earlier in people with Down's syndrome, at approximately 41 years of age. There is increased risk, if someone has an earlier onset of menopause, of developing other conditions, including poor bone health, but also, in the Down's syndrome population, it is associated with increased risk of dementia.",

They have five- or ten-minute appointments, which is not sufficient to make the reasonable adjustments that people with intellectual disabilities need, but also many GPs are seeing it as outside the normal delivery of care and they are charging an extra €100 for that. People are simply not able to afford that."

Then my mother noticed - he is living with her and she is 88 - that he was not really seeing and he was not reading. He always reads, but he was using his iPad and making the words quite large. I brought him back to the optician and said that maybe his glasses were there wrong ones. They were not, but they had totally missed that he needed cataract surgery urgently. I noted the difference when I brought him home from the surgery and he was out. When he took off the patch, he was actually touching leaves. He is very bright, and the fact he could not articulate that he could not see because he did not realise himself that he was having a problem really made me worry for those who do not have someone who can recognise the signs and pick up the pieces. My mother still gets very upset about it. He is great now, thank God.",

Parents are ageing. If this young man did not have the parents to bring him there, he would not have been able to go and get the care that he needed. It strikes me that within the system we have, we need to be able to do better in trying to ensure better health outcomes for, as Professor McCarron said, the preventable areas.

She came back and said that the one thing that she really took from it was that carers felt very devalued as people in terms of what they do for their loved ones, but they need that support and the respite care.

We are running a study there called EQUIP which is trying to develop a stop-start set of criteria in terms of prescribing. We are often seeing over-prescribing in some areas and under-prescribing in other areas. That is a concern. The prescribing patterns were very much driven by psychotropic drugs and laxatives. We were not seeing the same patterns of prescribing in terms of cardiovascular drugs, all of those medications. Even people who had conditions that one would expect to be painful were often not prescribed medications. This was also the case for some eye diseases. We are looking at this in great detail. Some medications are necessary. We have very high levels of epilepsy in this population, at more than 30% so we do need some of these medications. Our concern is particularly around the psychotropic medications, sedatives and tranquilisers. These certainly need to be looked at.",

These nurses should be in all our general hospitals and integrated care teams. They should be working in GP practices so that when a busy GP has a problem, there is a specialist-trained intellectual disability nurse there to navigate the issues and support the families and support the disabled individuals to have a better encounter. When we interviewed people with intellectual disabilities they told us that they could talk to their friends and family but that they were afraid to talk to medical or healthcare professionals. We could do this very quickly to address some of those issues if we are looking at solutions. We have a huge issue in identifying sepsis in this population, for example. The question is how we pick up on and identify some of these issues. They are some of the solutions to the concerns but we need to get these people into the integrated care teams.

The progress made in Ireland on providing care for people with an intellectual disability is to be welcomed. They are now living longer. The drive in policy towards community living has created a vacuum with the provision and delivery of care in a quagmire. The issues with the Senator's brother may have to do with him not being linked into or accessing services. We are very much in favour of a social-care model but if people with an intellectual disability are then competing with the general population to access health services, they are never going to win, unless they have the support to do so.",

Traditionally, Ireland and the UK are the only jurisdictions that have registered nurses in intellectual disability. Their role is to look at health surveillance. Everything Professor McCarron spoke about in her opening statement is theoretically preventable. However, we are witnessing the outcomes of what is happening. We need to be able to intervene earlier. As Professor McCarron said, there is one thing we could do very easily and that is to ensure that community intellectual disability nurses are providing care to the person with an intellectual disability. I am not saying that everybody has to have an intellectual disability nurse but if we had a system where their health needs were under ongoing surveillance, I have no doubt that the Senator's brother's cataracts would have been picked up on earlier."

I thank everyone for the great work they are doing.",

Nobody seemed to be prepared to step up to the plate. I am disappointed to see that we are still not really addressing this issue. I know a lot has probably been done but to my mind it is the one downside we are looking at and we need to do an awful lot better.

A few weeks ago we discussed the need for a dedicated team or service to address this. I think it is there but the report highlights that it is simply not good enough.",

These are all very marginalised groups. Many of these people were seeing the dentist; it was not that they were not seeing a dentist. They were seeing a dentist, but their oral health outcomes were worse. What is happening when they go to the dentist is the big issue.

Many of them are not employed and have very little wealth. Many of them will not have private health insurance and will not be able to buy private care. That is a real risk. How long will the wait be to get their hip operation done? Many of them will not have those resources. These are serious risks for this group, because many of them are not rich in either wealth or education. This particular cohort is ageing. It is to be hoped, and I am very hopeful, that future generations will look different, but we have to look after the population that is currently ageing and is with us now.

Specifically, people with an intellectual disability represented only 1.2% of the population in our last census. Even though it is every day as part of our lives, and we undertake work with people with intellectual disabilities and research, it is still a very small segment in society. What we need to do, and what the programme in ATU St. Angela's does, is raise awareness of disability within society. We need to see people with an intellectual disability and disabilities more broadly in mainstream society. By doing that, we can see that people have value and worth, but we need to increase the profile of seeing people with an intellectual disability. That programme in ATU is offered.",

That programme is very much about disability studies. I cannot comment specifically on it, but from what I know about that programme, it involves people with disabilities themselves. People with disabilities are delivering some of the content and they are participating. We have to look at the inclusion of people with intellectual disabilities within society more broadly. When the broader society sees people with disabilities and their value and their worth, we can progress a bit more. That is what the study does."

That is where we need to be looking at, planning for going ahead. Sometimes we hear, as soon as a child is born in other countries and it is recognised the child has a disability, that every stage of the child's life is planned for, such as the child's school place, home and so on. We need to get to that stage because the HSE in particular seems to operate continually in crisis mode, where everything is reacting to something and no plan is put in place.",

Next thing, the person with a disability is put into a residential setting, which may be miles from his or her home and away from everybody he or she knows. It is really hard. Some of the findings the witnesses have for health outcomes for people in congregated settings make me shudder because I am thinking what kind of life people have had in these settings for years on end, where they were locked away and basically forgotten about. It is awful.",
                "I submitted a parliamentary question not that long ago on numbers of people in congregated settings, expecting that the numbers would be going down and that people were being moved out into the community. It has been a number of years since we have moved on from congregated settings and we have had time to move on from that and from a situation where people, unfortunately, would have passed away before that happened. People are still being put in congregated settings, however, and that is really worrying. We also have a large proportion of people under the age of 65 being placed in nursing homes, not by choice but because there is nowhere else for them to go. Again, that is down to a lack of planning, both in housing and in the supports needed to allow people to live independent lives in their own communities. The work TILDA is doing and the studies it has done are really important. Lots of other good work is being carried out by different organisations and there are lots of reports, but they are sitting on shelves gathering dust and they are not being used to plan for the future, which is what is needed.",
                "The issue regarding the overuse of medication has been raised with me by a number of parents of young autistic adults. They are living in places that are not called congregated settings but group homes. There might be three, four or five people living in the home. I am very concerned about it because I have heard it from a number of people where the young people are being prescribed medication and nobody seems to be looking at what medication they are already on, how those medications all interact with each other and the danger that is causing to their physical health. I am not saying all of the homes are like this, but some of them seem to use medication to have an easy life for the staff. As I said, I do not want to cast that aspersion on all group homes, but some people are also being put into these homes without choice. We have the Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act and other Acts. We are supposed to be moving away from wardship of court, and it seems to be taking too long to happen. I am concerned. This relates to some of the things Professor McCarron has said. The work TILDA is doing is fantastic. Many of the questions I was going to ask have been asked, but what TILDA is doing is wonderful, and we need to use it to plan for our citizens and ensure we have inclusive communities where everybody is equal, catered for and valued.",

Much of the time, the interventions are longitudinal, with support from the therapists Professor McCarron spoke about. However, when services have a risk they are trying to manage, the use of medicine is innocent. They have the difficulty of trying to balance the health and welfare of the person with those of people providing support, knowing the intervention - for example long-term positive behavioural support, PBS - takes time and resources. Many times medicine and such interventions are used for a reason, for safety, and that creates lots of problems. We have retention and access issues, which augment these problems. That is why, as Professor McCarron described, the problems of psychotropic drug use and hyper-polypharmacy manifest on a practical level, when people are trying to support people with an intellectual disability because the interventions take time to have an impact. Within that, people are trying to manage risk and situations. It is a difficult situation for services to manage with the workforce. The Deputy hit the nail on the head. It is about projections and how many people there are with disabilities. On the front of an interesting report from the UK about children transitioning to adult services, one mother is reported as saying that she never thought her child would grow up. It says it is out of the pond into the sea. We have excellent data in IDS-TILDA. We know the problems and challenges and we should be able to address them."

We all know someone who is looking for support or have family members looking for support. I will ask about mental health supports available for people with intellectual disabilities living in the community, independently or semi-independently. What additional supports would be helpful? Funding is a huge issue and we are all aware of that, but we really need to look at it.",
                "From our meetings with all the different groups that have appeared before the committee, I know about the experience of people with disabilities, but there are no data on groups. What are the data on the different groups people attend? Do the witnesses work with the different groups?",
                "There are challenges. I work with families all the time in which a mother might have had to give up work to stay at home with a child who might have an intellectual disability. They do not qualify for carer's allowance because of an income that is over the means-test threshold. We should not be doing that. That has affected many families in recent years. I talk to families every day. We need to do something about that. Through no fault of their own, they need to stay at home with a child, an elderly person or other family member. They might apply for carer's allowance, but if they are in any way over the threshold, they will not qualify. It does not make sense. Many of the families tell me they have mortgages and other bills to pay and they do not know how they will cope.",
                "We need to look at what the system can do to support families, people with disabilities and the different agencies that need support. All the families I work with in County Carlow are excellent. We have all the different groups including Carlow Special Olympics Club and Down Syndrome Carlow. The families are very involved in the different areas and give up their time two or three nights a week. Social outlets are important for people with disabilities. They have their friends they want to meet. It is all about interacting and meeting their friends. People are good, but there is a lack of funding, awareness and education. What do we need to do to support the families who need that support? When people come to me, especially about trying to get carer's allowance, it is hard.",
                "Something important was said here today. I hope we have learned from our past when people with intellectual disabilities were segregated from their communities. We have to move on. It is great that people are living longer. However, while we have done great work - I am aware of the work the Ministers of State, Deputies Butler and Rabbitte, have done - the system is not able to cope as well as it should with the different areas.",

They cannot get the carer's allowance, yet one of the parents has to give up work to look after that person. We should not be dependent on organisations such as the Jack and Jill Foundation for essential care. The funding the Jack and Jill Foundation can give should be the icing on the cake. It should not be providing the package so the family can get away for a night to get a break. That must be State funded. We must understand the package that needs to be put together and the system. Often, the bureaucracy in getting critical resources overwhelms families when they are dealing with such complexity and providing loving and essential care, which they want to provide. It is not that they do not want to provide it. They have enduring love for the family member, but they need help and we need to understand how the system can give that help."

In the 1950s and 1960s, it was community organisations that came together to found various organisation like St. Michael's House, St. Joseph's Foundation and Cope Foundation. It was the goodwill of people in the communities who came together to form them. It is from the communities that best practice is coming within those section 38 or section 39 organisations. We have so far to travel.",

The presentation this evening certainly challenges us, as public representatives, and the system to the extent that we cannot even say we have much done. We have only scratched the surface of what is really needed to make sure people with disabilities reach their full potential and have the best possible life. It is more than 80 years since Maslow wrote the theory of the hierarchy of needs. We may have achieved a lot of that for the majority of society, particularly in the western world, but we have a long way to go in terms of disabilities.",

                "I thank the committee for the opportunity to present this request for substantive and technical Supplementary Estimates for the Department of Rural and Community Development. The substantive Estimate comprises: an additional €10 million in funding for the local improvement scheme; an additional €2 million in current funding for social inclusion supports, through the community connection project and an additional €218,157 for payroll within the Department and its agencies, to reflect costs from the recent pay agreement.",
                "The proposed technical Estimate covers the following: a movement of €6 million to fund demand under the community centre investment fund, with this fund moving from the community recognition fund; the movement of €3 million into the Leader programme, to meet demand, with €2.125 million from libraries capital and €875,000 from the community recognition fund; the movement of €2 million in capital funding to the dog control area, with this coming from the rural regeneration and development area. This funding is essential for improvements to dog-pound facilities. I am also seeking to move €1 million in islands' funding from capital to current, given the costs for transport services to the islands. Similarly, under the first part, I am seeking to move €1.45 million from capital to current expenditure. In the context of the Dublin north-east inner city initiative, there is a requirement to move €1.42 million from current to capital.",
                "The substantive Supplementary Estimate totals approximately €12.2 million and the technical Supplementary Estimate totals approximately €14.78 million. The additional €10 million in funding for the local improvement scheme allowed me to announce a funding package of €40 million for 2024 and 2025 in April of this year. This will see more than 1,000 roads improved across the country. This is a record level of funding for a scheme which I have supported very strongly in recent years. The additional €2 million in funding enabled the community connection project, which has seen 30 community link workers employed in local development companies. Their role is to help build community resilience against misinformation and prejudice, by working with local communities before, during and after the arrival of international protection applicants.",
                "The technical Supplementary Estimate is necessary to manage different levels of demand and delivery over the year since the original Estimates were brought forward. Delays in delivery of some library projects have resulted in a saving that I can use for the Leader programme. Delivery under the community recognition fund has also been a bit slower than I had hoped for. Therefore, I am using funds allocated for that area to meet additional demand under the Leader programme and the community centre investment fund. This reallocation does not impact on the level of approvals and expenditure under the community recognition fund, with the remaining bills for the first call under the fund having to be paid in 2025, as they arise.",
                "The movements allow us to best manage spending across the different schemes. I am also allocating €2 million in capital funding to the dog control area for improvements to pound facilities and dog control infrastructure, with the funding moving from rural regeneration and development. I have put a strong focus on this policy area over the last couple of years and this funding will help to support the local authorities in implementing the new regulations on XL bully dogs.",
                "Overall, 2024 has been another year of very strong delivery by the Department, with these movements of funds representing only very small adjustments to a budget of more than €430 million. These movements, along with some movements between capital and current, will allow my Department to put its resources to best use in supporting rural and urban communities around the country.",

I recognise what has been done on the local improvement schemes, but in practice, I find that the genuine list of projects that need to be done is way longer than the money that is being provided. Have any discussions taken place on the following? In the context of any road serving houses, farmland or a basic facility such as a strand or graveyard or anything else that would be done under the local improvement scheme, has anything been done to ensure that these would automatically be taken in charge once they are repaired by a council. The councils make a big fuss about taking in charge, but most small boreens require very little maintenance. We all know the old saying, \"A stitch in time saves nine\". Have there been any talks with the Department of Transport regarding that body's responsibility to these houses? I believe that everybody in the country is entitled to a water connection from the mains to their house, electricity, broadband and a road. They are the five fundamentals. Until 2011, it was always the Department of Transport which funded it. It was co-funded via CLÁR in the CLÁR areas on a euro-per-euro basis, but it was not given; it was contingent on the money being provided by the Department of Transport as well. That is the first question.",

It is amazing how people come - and the Minister has seen this syndrome before - just as we are hitting election buttons and they think that problems are going to be solved in three weeks. They do not realise that this is the greatest downtime in government. It is very hard to get things done once the Dáil is dissolved. The person who raised the issue in question with me referred to the funding of the community development programme for the islands. I do not think that the island development companies are matched anywhere on the mainland in the range of functions they carry out. They are the hub of activity on the islands and they are the bodies that Departments consult on island issues. They are involved in all sorts of projects, way beyond what other community development projects are, because of infrastructure and service issues and so on.",

Does that come under the remit of the Department in the context of dormant accounts? Does the Department of Education have overall responsibility for dormant accounts?",

                "Since 2017, we have put €170 into the local improvement scheme and as 5,000 roads have been completed during that time, there has been a lot of progress. I have written to the Minister for Transport on numerous occasions and every time I stand up in the Dáil I ask my colleagues to raise this with the Minister for Transport because these are roads, after all. I do not know if I will make much progress over the next couple of days but the Minister was not too keen to give me the money. Well, I am not saying that he was not too keen but I did not see it yet. There is a big role here for the Department of Transport and I have said that all along, because I can tell the Deputy that had it matched the funding we as a small Department with a relatively small budget have put into the LIS, the long list of lanes that are waiting would have been cleared. I did ask many times but the funding was not forthcoming. It is very important and I know the value of the LIS, as do any of the rural TDs. It is so important. We changed the criteria recently where it is not as tight, we have relaxed it a bit. This will allow more lanes to go onto the LIS but it will be a challenge and we will have to get more money to sort out the local improvement scheme. God knows, they really do a great job, when we see what can be done.",
                "As for the local authorities taking over these lanes when they are completed and when there are a number of houses, you often will be referred to the community scheme and that is okay also. I do not fund it but in helping farmers, the local improvement scheme has been extremely successful and it should be further invested in.",

Comhar na nOileán also called for the function to remain in the Department of Rural and Community Development, believe it or not - it wants to stay with us. Comhar na nOileán had its annual general meeting and stated it wanted to make it very clear it wants to stay with this Department and does not want to move to any other Department so I suppose that is an indication of some of the success we have had. There are a lot of challenges when one lives on an island. I visited them with Deputy Ó Cuív and have been to them on many occasions. The Department has strong island funding that I believe can be further increased to deal with the issues on the islands. The main issues are the piers and money has been set aside that is ring-fenced for islands through the LIS programme and that will have to be built on as well."

On the non-Gaeltacht islands, each island or cluster of islands in the case of small islands has a community development project on the island that is funded by the Minister's Department. The community development projects are seeking more funding because like all administration, the administrative burden has gone through the roof. They provide a wide range of functions and while I will not say they act as a kind of mini-local authority, they are the community group on the island. They normally have and election system where everybody is a member of the company and has a democratic vote. The community development projects are the local organisations that everybody, including Departments, look to as their touchstone on the islands. They say they do not have sufficient funding. Remember, it is much more expensive. If one is a manager on an offshore island and has to go to the mainland, a lot of the time that means staying overnight. They often have all sorts of costs the rest of us do not face on a daily basis and have sought further funding. Is that matter under consideration in the Department?"

While I am sure the Minister would award the funding if the projects were at a stage where it could be allocated, is it the case some of the projects are stuck in planning or anything like that? The Minister gave a commitment to funding ten new library projects in the last year and a half, or so. I am particularly aware of one in my local authority area, in Mahon. There has been a long-standing demand and request. I understand the new request has not come in from the local authority and the Minister might clarify that for me. Things have not progressed to that stage but it is not the only local authority in the country. It is vitally important we invest in our libraries to ensure they are able to evolve with the changing world. Also, some of the buildings are older. There was a commitment of approximately €2.6 million for mobile libraries this year. Has that progressed? If there is a backlog in the system and some sort of constraint preventing requests coming into the Department, can we examine what that is?",

In terms of the capital for libraries, there is a libraries fund but a lot of capital comes from the rural regeneration fund because, in many places across the country we are repurposing old buildings. The libraries really are a wonderful asset in every community. They are a hub, a centre for activity, and it is not just about books any more as it is about a whole plethora of things. I attended the opening of the library in Kilkenny and what is going on there is amazing. There are classes for different skill sets and I even saw sewing classes in the library. There is a fabulous, big room upstairs and many different things are happening. I believe the libraries are continuing to grow in the important role they play in our communities and are a resource for so many.",

There are a few more that need to be completed but I have no doubt but they will be done. They are in the pipeline and work is under way. The funding has not been approved for them but to get to that stage, we work closely with the local authorities and in some cases, the local authorities make contributions toward the library buildings as well.

Some €250,000, more or less, was invested in the library in Tramore to move it to the My Open Library service. Once people see such investment, they realise that the library has changed from bricks and mortar and books into something completely different. It has become a community hub. In particular, many teenagers, who are allergic to being at home with their parents, have a nice, warm and safe space where they can go. They are playing chess, on the computers, studying and so on. It is also wonderful that we essentially have a couple of community rooms, which people are using for classes, knitting initiatives, etc. They are also a presentation space. Our local GIY had a meeting in the library last week because it was a high-quality community site. Anything we can do to invest more in our libraries as community infrastructure is welcome.",

It looks to the Department of integration for some of its funding and some money comes from the Dormant Accounts Funding and the Department of Education. The programme most properly belongs in the Department of Education in order to be sustained in the long term. Currently, it looks like it is going to run out of funding. It is a very worthwhile programme that only costs a small amount of money. As Deputy Ó Cuív stated, we are about to enter a period of stasis in Government activity during the election and however long it takes for the next Government to be formed. A small intervention would keep this programme on the go and stop it from lapsing. Some programmes might be able to survive on life support for the next couple of months, but this one needs an intervention quickly."

It relates to her comments regarding the library in Kilkenny and to Deputy Ó Cathasaigh’s comments regarding what is happening in Tramore. A number of libraries around the country have additional spaces that are probably not being utilised in the best way possible. The advantage in using such spaces is that it brings people over the library’s threshold and they see what is happening in the library, which is different now compared with what happened there historically. It would be worthwhile for the Minister’s Department to write to each of the local authorities asking them to explore how there could be greater public use of spare room capacity. It is irrelevant what that use is, be it for knitting or sewing. It is just important that using the capacity brings people, and potentially new customers, over the threshold of the library. There is a positive impact in terms of well-being. Since Covid in particular, bringing people together is a positive, regardless of whether it is for flower arranging, men’s clubs or whatever. Will the Minister’s Department write to each of the local authorities and ask them to explore the greater utilisation of these public rooms for a wider range of activities?"

More people had moved into areas but had no community centres. It was particularly noticeable. Two such centres in Galway got funding. We then had another tranche. This fund has been extremely popular. A further tranche was launched recently. Last week, I announced the small grants from the community centre investment fund. These are for upgrades to existing community centres. We went through all of the applications and, while I do not know all of their details, the fund was not designed to top-up a shortfall. Rather, it was designed for specific works in centres across the country. We are assessing applications for larger-scale grants of up to €100,000. They will be announced by the new Minister, whenever he or she arrives. I believe I have all of the money spent. That is the state of play on the community centres investment fund."

That includes the Minister, my committee colleagues, the secretariat here and all the parliamentary community. There is a deep void left in our lives but also in public life. It is very apt that today we were approving funding of €10 million for the local improvement schemes. Last month, John would have been on Roscommon County Council for 21 years and he thrived on helping everyone that he met. I strongly believe there also will be a void in the Thirty-fourth Dáil, as I know John would have been an excellent parliamentarian and representative of the people of Roscommon and Galway. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.",
                "As this is my last contribution in the Oireachtas after nearly 28 years in Parliament, I thank the people in the counties of Longford, Leitrim, Galway and Roscommon most sincerely for the trust they have placed in me over the years. It truly has been an honour to represent the people from these counties in Dáil Éireann over that time. I sincerely thank all the staff who have worked with me over the years. I particularly want to mention the committee team here. Over the past four years, we have had the late Paul Kelly, Ailish Murphy and Jack Savage and the current team we have here, Caoímhe O’Rourke, Ciara Marrinan, Haley O’Shea and Devan Whitson, as well as all the support staff here who keep this committee operation going.",
                "I also thank those who held the fort for me in the constituency, particularly Deirdre Concannon and Jill Mellor. Finally, I thank my family for their support over the years which, at times, have been difficult and challenging. It is with mixed emotions that the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív and I are all leaving the House. Young Deputy Ó Cathasaigh has many more years here and we wish him many more years of successful representation in this House.",

This is provided through €1 million in savings from subhead A6, tourism product development, and €4.8 million in savings from subhead D7, large scale sports infrastructure. On the media side, TG4 will receive further funding totalling €4.5 million to allow it to accelerate a number of commissioned projects and plan for increased commissioning of children’s content. This increased funding is provided through €2.6 million in savings across the Gaeltacht programme area, €1 million in savings from subhead D7, large scale sports infrastructure fund, and €900,000 savings in admin pay across my Department. In addition, €5 million is provided to subhead E7, Coimisiún na Meán, to meet fines and penalties arising from EU case C-679/22. This funding is met from savings of €1 million in subhead B7, cultural infrastructure and development, and €4 million in savings from subhead D7, large scale sports infrastructure fund, LSSIF.",
                "The other impact of this Supplementary Estimate is technical in nature, and relates to disbursement of broadcasting licence fees and Exchequer funding for RTÉ. It is important to note that this does not represent an increase in funding for RTÉ and represents a net-zero cost to the Exchequer. The total overall funding RTÉ will receive from my Department in 2024 remains unchanged from the original Estimate. The adjustments are twofold. First, we anticipate an improved performance in TV licence receipts over and above that originally estimated. The inconsistent pattern in the sales of television licences in recent times has made the forecasting of licence receipts more difficult. While it remains a challenge to accurately predict year-end outturn, we are now in a better position to frame the expected increase as an additional €4.726 million in receipts to the Exchequer. The overall TV licence receipts fall to be distributed across subheads E3, E4 and E6 in accordance with the provisions of the Broadcasting Act 2009. These provisions require that 7% of net licence fee receipts goes to the broadcasting fund with the balance to RTÉ. These funds are net of expenses arising from licence fee collection paid to An Post. Second, adjustments arise on foot of the €40 million in Exchequer funding for 2024 allocated to RTÉ under subhead E8, which was initially offset in total against subhead E3, grant to RTÉ from licence fees, as part of the Revised Estimates 2024.",
                "However, pro rata offsets in funding have to be applied to subheads E4 and E6 to ensure full compliance with the provisions of the Broadcasting Act. The cumulative impact of the increased television licence receipts and the technical adjustments required to comply with the relevant legislation result in a net decrease to subheads E4 and E6 and an increase in subhead E3 as outlined in the technical Supplementary Estimate documentation. These are technical adjustments that we are obliged to make under the Broadcasting Act 2009. The adjustments do not represent an increase in funding for RTÉ; rather, a redistribution of the funding between the amount available in respect of broadcasting licence fees and direct Exchequer funding.",
                "As previously mentioned, the total overall funding which RTÉ received from my Department in 2024 remains unchanged from the original Estimates. Cuirfidh mé ar aghaidh sibh chuig an Aire, an Teachta Byrne, le labhairt faoi na coigeartuithe ar fud réimse an chláir spóirt.

I welcome this pace of delivery from communities throughout the country when it comes to sports projects. This underlines the ongoing demand for support across sporting clubs and bodies for which the Government has provided record funding. In addition, €200,000 is being provided to subhead D8, which is for major sports events and this is just to meet commitments in bringing the Ryder Cup to Ireland in 2027.",
                "This additional funding is provided through savings in subhead D7, which is the LSSIF heading, where unfortunately drawdown on some large projects has been slower than anticipated. This is something I have spoken about on a number of occasions. Savings from this subhead have, as I said, been reallocated to the community sports facilities fund but also reallocated to support Tourism Ireland, TG4 and Coimisiún na Meán as referenced by the Minister. This technical Supplementary Estimate does not amount to any additional Exchequer funding outside that provided under the original Revised Estimates for 2024. However, it allows for the continued support of sport.",

                "I thank the Minister and the Minister of State as well as their departmental colleagues for joining us this afternoon. I simply want to thank them both and their colleagues for the powerfully impactful work they have done in their time in these roles. It has been a tumultuous time in Irish media. They navigated that with exceptional skill and deep consideration for the importance of public sector broadcasting and public sector media generally. Now, at the end of that tumultuous time we find ourselves in a much better place.",
                "In regard to investment in sport, as the Minister of State outlined, we are seeing unprecedented investment in communities in the health and well-being of our young people in particular, instilling in them the importance very early on in life of participation in every kind of sport. In particular for women and girls in sport, where in the past we have seen a significant drop-off in participation in their late teenage years, the investments that have been made in most recent times are working to address that in a very real and effective manner. This week we saw a significant allocation of funds to Kinvara Hockey Club which is setting out to provide a world-class hockey and multisport facility in a small village in south Galway that will serve south Connacht and north Clare well for the future. We grossly underestimate at times the power of the sports capital investments that we make to leverage extraordinary community endeavour and community connectedness. Kinvara is a perfect example of that.",
                "In terms of our sporting investment for the future, I am wondering where our national velodrome is at. Significant commitments have been made and there is planning permission. I thank the Ministers for the additional investment being made in potentially developing a new velodrome in Limerick on the western side of the country. I was fortunate to visit New Zealand about six or seven years ago in my role as Minister of State for the diaspora. I visited two different velodromes there. The New Zealand Government and indeed the New Zealand nation as a whole have proven conclusively that when facilities of that nature are provided it encourages and supports young people in getting involved in sport, and in particular in cycling, at a very young age. As well as producing Olympic medal winners, it helps to develop that lifelong love of sporting participation, which is so important for people's health and well-being. I thank both of the Ministers and their colleagues. I wish them every success in the upcoming election. It is going to be a difficult time for anybody out there putting their head above the parapet. Well done and thank you."

It is a working centre of excellence for Connacht rugby and for other activities. I really like to see that because when we invest in sport, we want to make sure that the facilities we provide are used to the greatest possible degree. In this round of LSSIF, many sports are covered, including many multisport facilities throughout the country. That is really welcome. I look forward to seeing these projects go.",

In the Supplementary Estimate, we are taking from the LSSIF because drawdown has not been as anticipated. That has bedevilled the programme that was announced in 2020. Many projects that were announced in 2020 have not started. Very few are finished. That cannot continue. It is a very clear message to the projects that got funding. We are delighted but we want to see them done. If they are not done within the timeframe the Department agreed with them in their funding agreement and if they do not comply with that, the funding will move on.",

As sure as night follows day, these projects will be funded if they are valid and they meet the conditions.

We would have no credibility if we just gave a list of €600 million last week. We had to do it properly. We had to make sure that these projects that are funded will actually be delivered and actually happen."

We do not always get everything we want, but right across the country sports communities and facilities will thrive because of funding from his Department. Bandon, County Cork, will have an athletics track. West Cork will have an athletics track. That is phenomenal. For a region that has produced megastars such as Phil Healy without a track, we can imagine what we would do with a track. We have to acknowledge that. That is the backslapping over.",

Kinsale Hockey Club in Saile is something I advocated for. The centre applied for what would have been a wonderful multisport complex in Kinsale, not just catering for hockey but for a range of sports and access to the entire community. It is sad and disappointing that Cork County Council did not sponsor this and have it as one of its projects. I know it gave a letter of support, but I think it has questions to answer as to why it did not select this as one of its projects for funding, because when they do not it leaves them hampered. That is work we need to do.",
                "The Minister of State mentioned that there will be a reserve list. I will advocate for Kinsale hockey and the Saile project to be at the top of that list. Is it too late at this point for Cork County Council to come on board with that project as the main sponsor, as it was not there originally? Of the LSSIF projects, it is the one I would have loved to have seen succeed. We did not get one in west Cork, but I would love to have some light at the end of the tunnel for what would be an amazing multisport project. I acknowledge he mentioned multisport projects that were funded. I understand the GAA received between 36% and 37% of the LSSIF funding. Soccer was high as well at 25%. That is absolutely welcome as soccer needs investment as well, but those multisport facilities also need investment. Is there no chance a chunk of that €5.8 million will go there?"

On Kinsale in particular, I visited the centre with the Acting Chairman so I am familiar with the project. We said that all valid applications will be placed on the reserve list. I can confirm that the Kinsale project is valid. That will be funded at some point, as funding becomes available. On the mechanics of that, what is happening at the moment is the Department is focusing on the grants and grant agreements that have been awarded. A lot of work has to be done to get these out. In the coming weeks, or in a few months, the exact process for the reserve list will be set out for those on it. I expect it will be a dynamic process. I am not talking specifically about Kinsale, but if a project without planning permission gets planning permission, it is envisaged that the Department would become aware of that, and it would change the matrix for that particular project in showing how deliverable it is. In some of those projects there are other issues such as own funding, and in some cases land ownership. There are people out there complaining that their project did not get the go-ahead when the people behind the project do not even own the land. There are lots of things like that, so we cannot just award funding to some of them."

                "I move to tourism. I see an allocation towards strategic tourism. It is a sector I have slight concerns about. I am from west Cork, where tourism and hospitality are the biggest indigenous employers. They are finding it difficult and are going through a tough time at the moment. Footfall from different parts of Europe appears to be down. Footfall from the UK appears to be down as well. We obviously had the debate about VAT. I know where I stood on that, but the cost of business is obviously quite high. A lot of hospitality businesses are finding it hard to make the margins to keep going and stay alive. What we really need here is a strategic approach to try to attract people from right across, to increase domestic tourism but also tourism from Europe, the US and the UK. Will the Minister comment on the overall strategy to ensure the future of a sector we are all proud of?"

                "There is additional funding of €5.8 million for Tourism Ireland, which is about promoting the entire island to overseas visitors, including to our US, GB and European markets. I am targeting funding towards supporting the regions to ensure benefits of tourism as spread as widely as possible. In the budget, I announced I have retained funding that will allow Tourism Ireland to continue its major marketing campaigns overseas to ensure visitors continue to be attracted to holiday in Ireland. The funding I have retained for Fáilte Ireland will continue to work in the area of recruitment and retention and to support businesses where the recruitment and retention of staff continues to be an issue. Fáilte Ireland also has funding to support domestic marketing. This week we will publish the tourism strategy which puts emphasis on that domestic marketing as well because we need to increase that from the point of view of sustainability. On the €5.8 million we are discussing here, there is €2.25 million going to the Wild Atlantic Way ten-year anniversary. There is €730,000 going to the St Brigid's Day off-peak market. There is €1.6 million for Ireland: Home of Halloween. The inland cruise and sustainability promotion gets €250,000, the ferry access promotion gets €500,000 and there is €500,000 for Ireland in Germany. The Deputy can see where it is about promoting the island of Ireland, but he will see the domestic market feature heavily in the tourism strategy that will be published this week. It was agreed at Cabinet yesterday."

In 2023, between flat, national hunt and point-to-point racing, IHRB professional officials and volunteer race day stewards oversaw a combined 483 race fixtures across the 32 counties, with 38,601 runners in total.",
                "It is the ambition of the board and management that the IHRB be recognised as a world-class regulator for horse racing with an ongoing focus on excellence in the delivery of our core functions of integrity, rider safety and equine welfare. The IHRB is currently engaged in an ambitious programme of modernisation and change, guided by the board's strategy for the period 2024-2027, which we published late last year. This strategy commits us to consistently applying a robust governance framework and rigorous probity regime.",

In mid-2023, a significantly revised and strengthened service level agreement governing the provision and use of funding for horse racing integrity services was agreed between IHRB and HRI and we continue to operate within the agreed funding parameters.",
                "As the committee will recall, the board became aware in June 2023 of an issue relating to financial governance which had occurred in early 2022. This was immediately brought to the attention of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Horse Racing Ireland and the Comptroller and Auditor General, and was disclosed to the Oireachtas public accounts committee the following day. The issue concerned an unauthorised transfer in January 2022 of €350,000 from the Jockeys Emergency Fund, a charity bank account administered by the IHRB, to the IHRB’s bank account. This was subsequently reversed in April 2022.",
                "The professional services firm Forvis Mazars was engaged to carry out an independent review of this and other financial governance matters, which involved detailed scrutiny of six years’ worth of IHRB financial and other records as well as interviews with relevant individuals. Its report was received late last week and has been shared with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General. It was published yesterday.",
                "The IHRB recognises the importance of a robust governance structure and believes the incident that gave rise to the Forvis Mazars review should not have happened. Reassuringly, the review identified no transactions in breach of financial governance requirements other than that which prompted the initial concern, and there was no evidence of misappropriation for personal gain. Nonetheless, since commissioning the review, significant changes to enhance financial governance have been implemented by the IHRB or are in progress, guided by draft reports provided during the review process.",
                "These measures, designed to address the recommendations, include strengthened financial controls, particularly regarding the authorisation and approval of online banking payments, with strict transaction approval limits and segregation of accounts access; developing and enforcing comprehensive documentation and formal approval procedures for all material financial transactions; strengthening and expanding the existing service level agreement between IHRB and HRI to capture governance and other requirements and enhanced transparency and reporting mechanisms in relation to the integrity services budget; putting in place formal written agreements and detailed procedures with all charities and non-profit entities receiving administrative support from the IHRB, setting out roles and responsibilities; strengthened governance procedures on the approval, funding and reporting of redundancy and retirement payments; supporting the trustees of the charities in their implementation of appropriate and effective charity governance policies and procedures; recording and tracking our organisational compliance with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies; closer collaboration with HRI and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on financial and governance matters; and increased operational collaboration with HRI on efficient delivery of shared objectives, which is already bringing gains in capacity, effectiveness and resilience.",
                "The IHRB is resolute in our commitment to fully addressing the issues highlighted in the review, making the necessary changes to uphold the highest standards of financial governance and assuring public trust in the IHRB as the regulator of Irish horse racing. We are satisfied the measures identified will address the recommendations made by Forvis Mazars and we are on target to have them fully implemented by year end.",
                "Reducing the risk of injury to racehorses on track, especially fatal injury, is a significant challenge to racing jurisdictions worldwide and is a core pillar of the IHRB strategy. To this end, the board initiated the equine injury in Irish racing risk-reduction project to determine, analyse and mitigate risk factors for racing-related equine injuries in Ireland and to identify opportunities to improve safety for our horses and riders. The project’s findings have led to an enhancement of the IHRB’s race-day equine veterinary inspection programme, new standards for racecourse trot-up areas, and implementation of an evidence-based risk assessment for race-day injury. Alongside enhanced inspections on track before any previously injured horse returns to racing, the IHRB veterinary team works with trainers and their own vets to ensure the horse’s suitability to race. We also run periodic expert seminars for trainers and vets to provide information on reducing race-related equine injury.",
                "The equine anti-doping programme remains a top priority and our approach continues to evolve in line with international best practice, with ongoing phased implementation of the recommendations of the independent Suann review. IHRB teams took 5,866 samples from horses in 2023, which were analysed at LGC in Newmarket, one of only six IFHA recognised reference laboratories worldwide. These resulted in the detection of six adverse findings and the trainers involved have been dealt with through our disciplinary processes in accordance with the rules of racing.",
                "This year we also launched a joint anti-doping initiative with the British Horseracing Authority which saw approximately 250 samples, both blood and hair, taken from more than 120 horses across 14 training establishments in advance of the Cheltenham festival. To enhance transparency, we have begun monthly publication of anti-doping and other integrity activity data on our website, including details of horses which have been the subject of an adverse finding.",

I would not like to let this opportunity go without acknowledging his excellent and amazing knowledge of agriculture and his very fair approach to chairing the business of this Oireachtas committee. He understood the brief exceptionally well. He worked exceptionally well with the members and the Department. He was never afraid to confront or challenge the status quo and worked effectively with organisations. He included them and encouraged them to come in here in an open and frank way and participate and engage. He was always courteous to us and facilitated us here. I take this opportunity to wish Jackie well in the future. As I say, he was an excellent Chair and guided us through our work. At this point I also acknowledge the work of our clerk and the secretarial support and all the other support around it. I just wanted to get that out of the way. Jackie is an exceptional man with huge knowledge of agriculture and we will certainly miss him and his guidance of this committee.",
                "Coming to the business in hand, I start on a positive note. I was speaking in the Seanad the day before yesterday, and we were celebrating and I was talking about the Irish jockey Robbie Dolan, who rode Knight's Choice and claimed the Lexus Melbourne Cup. What a day and what an achievement. It is a really positive story for racing internationally. I am sorry I did not have a penny on him because, at 80-1, the odds were fantastic and happy days for anyone who had €500 on that. That is a really positive note to start here.",
                "We have an amazing equestrian industry and an amazing reputation all over the world. We do not want that to be blemished or undermined. We want to work constructively with all stakeholders in this sector because the Irish sports horse and all that goes with it are vital. We have discussed the issue at length. We acknowledge that there are shortcomings in governance. There have been challenges with testing for doping in sports in the past but I think things are genuinely improving.",
                "I do not intend to ask too many questions but I want to make a few observations. I considered in detail the various reports that were submitted to us. All members have seen them and studied them. We teased out the details among ourselves. I examined the IHRB annual reports before I came here today.",
                "The IHRB statement of strategy for 2024 to 2027 is fantastic. It is great to set goals and achievements. We cannot forget what has gone before but that is really positive and important. The statement is well laid out and explained. It is easy to measure and I salute the witnesses for that.",
                "I looked at the report of the equine injury in Irish racing reduction project, which is important. It was interesting to learn about that. I read the IHRB equine anti-doping reports, which were interesting. There are challenges in that regard, as the witnesses acknowledge. There have also been vast improvements in that regard. I also read the independent review of the IHRB equine anti-doping programme, which is important. I see pathways and evidence of a concentrated and positive way of going forward. That is what I want to dwell on tonight.",
                "I have also studied the detailed financial governance review from Forvis Mazars and certain transactions with the IHRB. That sets out a comprehensive background to some of the issues that the witnesses have addressed today. I do not intend to dwell on those matters. It is good that we have an auditing system. Mazars is an exceptional company and it has set out a number of issues, so that is transparent and important. Transparency is key to governance.",
                "I will touch on a few issues. I looked at the strategic plan, the vision and governance, and the various pillars that have been set out. The IHRB, as we all know, has a legal responsibility to protect the reputation and integrity of the Irish horse racing sector. That is important. We talked about the Melbourne Cup. Anything to do with our reputation is critical to the success of the industry, its further growth and the realisation of its potential. That is something that Irish people in general are very proud of and it is important.",
                "I also think of the context of this report. There is an absolute responsibility in terms of administration and management. Substantial Government grants are significant to the industry. Every year, we approve funding and consider issues around sports horses generally. It is not always easy. There is a lot of conflict around some of those issues in the days leading up to the approval of funding with consideration of whether it should be varied and whether more money should be designated or ring-fenced for welfare as opposed to something else. That is important. I have no vested interest here and I do not know anyone on the board or any of the governors or trustees. I see evidence of a clear strategy for good corporate governance, which is important.",
                "There is the ongoing issue and challenge around ensuring compliance with good practice and the code of practice for the governance of State bodies. The witnesses will be familiar with that. I see evidence of all of that. It is there. The witnesses are clearly aware of their corporate governance responsibilities in that area, which is also important.",
                "I am not fully apprised of and do not have an in-depth knowledge of the organisation in respect of how it is resourced for compliance and risk functions. I note that is in there but it is an important challenge. There is a risk assessment audit system within the Oireachtas. Every organisation has such a system. It is important that sufficient resources and skill sets are available and applied to ensure high compliance. What gives confidence to people in respect of compliance is transparency. The witnesses are here today on a programme that is broadcast on Oireachtas TV. They are on the record of the Oireachtas. That sort of transparency instils confidence and that is important.",
                "I encourage the witnesses to have greater collaboration with HRI. Mr. O'Loughlin identified that issue. He said that he plans to have greater engagement with HRI and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, as it is now. It may become a different Department in a few months' time.",
                "It is nice and dandy to say there will be constructive stakeholder engagement through strong communication processes, consultation or collaboration, but there needs to be greater evidence, going forward. I ask the witnesses to focus more on that issue because it is important.",
                "It is rare that I come to this committee, which I have been a member of for the past five years, without a question to ask. Having studied in detail the documents submitted to the committee, I am of the view that the board is putting in place, and has put in place, mechanisms. It would be interesting if the witnesses were to come back to the committee in 12 months' time and tell us how it is going. I do not have any questions. I thank the witnesses for coming and for being upfront and honest about the problems they have encountered. They have acknowledged that some system threw up this anomaly or concern and that has now been addressed. I thank the witnesses for coming before the committee."

We send him our regards through the committee.",

As he said, we are trying to be as transparent and open as we can to set out a plan for the future. We are guided on a daily, weekly, monthly and annual basis by that strategy. My staff are probably sick of hearing me tell them why we do what we do under that strategy and linking that work back to that strategy. It is important to have a vision for an organisation. That vision for us includes governance, probity, transparency and accountability. That is important.",
                "The Senator spoke of, and emphasised the need for, consultation and collaboration. I agree with him. Over the course of this year, which is the first year of the strategy, we have made particular efforts to expand our consultation and collaboration with stakeholders. We have, for example, engaged frequently, professionally and constructively with the Irish Jockeys Association, even in relation to penalties for riding offences under the rules of racing. There has been a need to increase penalties in some areas and to ease them in others to modify behaviour and ensure safe riding. We have found through that engagement that the jockeys have been very helpful. The resulting changes have landed much better. They have been accepted by the members of the association and that audience, which makes for a smoother and better regulatory atmosphere. We are not asking them what penalties they want but we are explaining why we are doing what we are doing and the jockeys are helping by telling us how they think we should do what we were going to do anyway. I agree with the Senator on that point and, as I said, I am grateful to him for taking the time to understand our organisation and industry to such an extent."

They will ask why, if there are rules in place, they are not being followed and why there are breaches and issues. In that context, it is important that the regulatory authority have everything in order, more so than anybody else, because it is the body that is supposed to be policing everybody else. In this context, it is quite alarming that there were issues. In fairness, the delegates have dealt with them and they have been spelled out here. Nonetheless, we need to have accountability in all of this. Sometimes there are blame games in various places. Blame is one thing but it is really a matter of responsibility and taking responsibility. I acknowledge that the delegates have taken responsibility for the issues that have arisen but there are still difficulties for many people and many issues. Various people from the equine industry in general have raised difficulties and problems with us, and this too needs to be acknowledged and dealt with.",

Colleagues have mentioned that the State puts a very large amount of money into the horse racing industry. There is no other “sport” in Ireland that gets funding at anything like the same level. Government coffers are always tight and there are always issues. We have people on waiting lists to get appointments in hospitals and to get housing, and one of the things that keeps coming up is the absence of resources. The public sees a large amount of money going to an industry that, to most looking from the outside, is doing pretty well. If the Government and the Oireachtas as a body are to stand over that, they have to be certain of authenticity and that the bodies that provide funding and the regulatory bodies that govern all of this do so with absolute integrity. That is why it is so important that we get all this stuff right.",

We have had successful jockeys, including Robbie Dolan, the young man in Australia who won the Melbourne Cup the other day. We have great success stories that we need to acknowledge. However – I want to finish on this point as I am not here to ask questions and was late to the meeting – it is important that the board that governs the IHRB, and not just the guests present, and the boards that govern all the organisations that benefit from Government funding for the horse racing industry recognise that they have a huge responsibility to the public to ensure everything is done with complete integrity in the industry. There have been serious question marks in this regard. This is a message that the guests need to take with them. I will leave it at that."

It was always a pleasure to be here at his request to step into the Chair if he had somewhere else to go. Perhaps the clerk could convey to him the expressions of high regard made here this evening. As Deputy Fitzmaurice said, this committee is here for the good of dealing with the topics in front of its members. Politics was left outside the door.

                "I will probably concentrate mainly on the Mazars report, which we got yesterday evening and which I read. I welcome it and all the actions coming from it, but I want to go back to why it had to be commissioned in the first place. Saying we will leave it now and walk on is like saying that, although there were problems, they will never happen again. We cannot turn our backs on what did happen. I have a few questions based on that. There are two paragraphs in the material on the report with which we were supplied that I find very damning. I will take it from there. They are about the payment of the former CEO. They state:",
                "On this basis we do not consider that this payment fell within the rules and criteria of the Scheme. We consider that the use of public funds provided by HRI to IHRB for the purpose of a retirement payment to the Former CEO, was not specifically sanctioned in writing by HRI. We believe such a formal/written sanction should have been required under the governance arrangement for retirement and redundancy payments established by HRI.",
                "From a review of the Financial Statements of IHRB for the year here from a review of the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021, we noted that the retirement amount paid to the Former CEO was reported as being part of the Voluntary Redundancy and Early Retirement Scheme. Based on our review and analysis, as noted above, this payment was not made or formally approved within the criteria of the Scheme, and this disclosure is therefore incorrect.",
                "That is in IHRB’s accounts. It is public funding. As said on a couple of occasions while I was here this evening, we are getting more and more grief every year when it comes to us – perceived to be racing people – sanctioning the horse and greyhound fund. Then one reads what I have just quoted. It is in the public domain. I just quoted it for the purpose of my question. The questions raised are still not answered. It is okay to say that what happened happened and that there are recommendations from a company – they cost €80,000 – to ensure it will never happen again, but it did happen and we need answers. The retirement amount is recorded in the accounts as being part of the voluntary redundancy and early retirement scheme.",
                "The only word missing is \"or\". It should read \"and or early retirement\". Did the man take voluntary redundancy or early retirement? Why did he receive €141,000 more than was in the package? Did any heads roll over this? The argument that this is never going to happen again and that we should move on does not wash with me to be honest.",
                "This all came to light at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts. Mr. John Murphy's predecessor was on paid leave for over a year. I read last night about what was going on. There were voluntary redundancies. How many people applied for them and how many were unsuccessful in their application? Compulsory redundancy was also mentioned and I would like to know more about that too. The money was not there to pay them or to pay the over-and-above payment for the CEO's retirement. In fairness to Mr. Murphy’s predecessor, from my reading of it, he found himself in a situation in which the wage checks were going to bounce. He got €350,000 to make sure that did not happen by moving money from one account to another in order to get over the hump because €141,000 was spent that had not been budgeted for. He got over the hump and then the money went back. Did he leave of his own free will after one year of garden leave? Is he the only person who fell on his sword? I believe he was doing the best he could to ensure wage checks did not bounce. There are a lot of questions to be answered before we accept that the systems in place now are the solution to the problem because this problem happened.",
                "I have a big grievance. As I said at the outset, I am racing man. I attend a lot of racing and talk to a lot of racing people. A lot of people are annoyed and will be even more annoyed when they read this report because it damages the good reputation of racing. The reading of this report could not be more damaging to the good reputation of racing. As people said to me on the racetracks, a trainer called John Joseph Hanlon, better known as “The Shark”, inadvertently - and it was careless - did not secure a tarpaulin properly over a dead horse on a Friday evening when he needed to move it or he would have been in bother for not moving before the following Monday morning. He received a ten-month suspension as a result. Horse welfare is involved when horses have to be moved. The suspension has been halved on appeal. Those horses have to be moved. There are jobs at loss. That man is suffering for a little bit of recklessness in a rush on a Friday evening. I am being told by racing people that this man is being used as an example. No one will suffer in this case, however. Who is getting the ten-month suspension over what happened here? Who is going to lose their job? Who is going to have to sell off their horses? Who is going to have to let staff go for the now reduced time of six months? I am only relaying what has been said to me on the racetracks. He is being used by the IHRB as an example to show that it is running such a tight ship and that this is how it deals with someone who brings racing into disrepute. Who, however, is suffering and falling for this?"

What Mazars has found, however, is that because the package agreed with the CEO at the time was greater than the scheme rules allowed for, and, as Mazars has written in its report, because it was not sanctioned in writing by HRI, it did not comply with the terms of that scheme and, according to Mazars, should not have been reported as part of the scheme. Our financial statements for 2021, however, were audited, and in the audit report it was disclosed exactly how much had been paid to the retiring CEO. Then, as regards the three redundancies, there was one figure given for the scheme, and Mazars has said now, in 2024, that the way in which it was disclosed in the financial statements for 2021 was not correct, in its opinion. At the time, however, the auditors audited and they disclosed the payment that was made to the then former CEO."

                "The Department is acutely aware of the financial and emotional stress associated with a TB breakdown. It causes significant hardship for farmers and farming families. This Department is committed to the objectives of the bovine TB eradication strategy and programme, which aims to reduce and ultimately eradicate this disease in Ireland. Unfortunately, since we were before the committee last year, the prevailing disease situation has not improved despite the efforts of stakeholders. The importance of Ireland’s TB eradication programme in underpinning farm family income should not be underestimated. As a country that exports 90% of our livestock produce, access to international trade markets is fundamental. It is a requirement of EU trade law to have an eradication programme. This enables Irish farmers to access the EU Single Market for our cattle, including calves, and their meat and milk. This is also a requirement for access to third country markets. Our export markets to third countries have grown substantially in value and volume in the last ten years, and it is notable that in several cases, TB is a significant consideration in the context of trade and certification requirements. A cost benefit analysis report of the TB programme carried out by Grant Thornton in 2021 estimated that in economic terms, 78% of the benefits of the bovine TB eradication programme relate to private goods while 22% accrues to public goods.",
                "TB is a challenging disease to control and eradicate due to several factors. The relative contribution of each of these factors varies from farm to farm. They include movement of cattle with undetected infection; residual infection in cattle previously exposed to TB; the inherent limitations of the tests; a reservoir of disease in a protected species, namely, the badger; and inadequate biosecurity practices on farms. As such, it is important that farmers are empowered to make the best choices for their own circumstances to protect their cattle from TB. It is critical that they are given practical advice based on scientific research about how they can reduce their TB risk, as well as relevant and useful information about their own herds, their own cattle and their own farming practices in order that they can make any management changes which may be necessary if they wish to avoid the costs and stress of a TB breakdown. This includes making informed decisions about the purchase of cattle and maintaining good overall herd health. The advice on how to reduce TB risk in a herd has remained generally consistent over many years and we continue to encourage farmers to act on it utilising a broader range of communication tools. Stakeholder endorsement of this advice, through the TB Forum, is hugely important in encouraging farmers to take active steps to reduce their TB risk.",
                "Vaccinating badgers reduces the transmission of TB within the badger population and thereby reduces transmission to cattle.",
                "This protects cattle and reduces losses to farmers while safeguarding a native protected Irish wild species. Scientific research carried out in Ireland over many years has demonstrated the effectiveness of badger vaccination. We are providing information and advice on the practical steps farmers can take to reduce the risk from badgers by a range of means, including text messages, videos, leaflets and farmer meetings. By combining these practical farmer-led risk reduction actions with the policy of vaccination to prevent breakdowns and targeted licensed badger removal where necessary in response to spillover from badgers to cattle, we can greatly mitigate the risk of TB at the wildlife and cattle interface.",
                "The bovine TB stakeholder forum, established in May 2018, in line with international best practice on the governance of animal health programmes has a mandate to develop evidence-informed policies that can control and ultimately eradicate TB. The Bovine TB Eradication Strategy 2021-2030 was published in January 2021 and identified the key actions necessary to eradicate TB. The key actions in the strategy are preventing spread from herds with a high risk of recurrence; enhanced actions to clear infection from extended breakdown herds; addressing the risk from inconclusive animals; action plans for areas with increased localised TB levels; aligning with changes in the EU animal health law TB regulations; reducing the risk posed by badgers and deer; tailored and simplified communications between the Department and herdowners; clearer messaging of the risks of TB transmission and how to address them; and biosecurity advice delivered to farmers, with a focus on practical, clear and effective actions to reduce risk and incentivise risk-lowering behaviour.",
                "From time to time, a narrative develops that our objective should be to control TB due to the failure thus far to eradicate it. Aside from our EU obligation to have an eradication programme and the importance of this programme to our export partners throughout the world, I wish to be clear that the actions we need to focus on and implement are the same, whether the goal is to control or eradicate this disease.",
                "As of 27 October, 5,906 herds had suffered a TB breakdown in the previous 12 months in comparison with 4,914 in the same period last year. Data analysis suggests the reasons underpinning current levels of TB incidence are the expansion of the dairy herd and the resulting increased levels of intensive cattle farming and increased movement of cattle. These conditions are associated with heightened susceptibility to disease, whether that is TB or any other infectious disease. We have also seen a substantial increase in the number of reactors, with 39,339 being disclosed in the past 12 months in comparison with just over 26,500 in the previous 12 months, an increase of 12,758, or 48%. In addition, almost 9.89 million tests were carried out in the 12 months up to 27 October compared with around 9.66 million tests in the same period in 2023.",
                "In driving strategic change in the bovine TB programme in Ireland, the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, has consistently highlighted the important role of stakeholder collaboration. Reflecting this, implementation of the TB strategy is being facilitated by a governance structure designed to ensure all perspectives are considered. The TB stakeholder forum is supported by three working groups, scientific, finance and implementation, each of which has an independent chair to deliver on its specific terms of reference. The working groups report back to the TB forum as required throughout the year.",
                "In 2023, more than 9.8 million individual animal TB tests were completed in more than 100,000 herds. Delivering the TB programme in any given year represents a massive logistical operation achieved through the co-operation of farmers, private vets and Department officials right across the country. The overall cost to the Exchequer of the TB programme, excluding staff costs, has increased from full-year costs of €57 million in 2023 to €74 million as of the end of October, and it is on track to increase further in 2025. In this time, the primary driver of increased costs has been compensation. For many years, Ireland’s TB programme has been financially supported by the EU. However, EU support for the TB programme has ceased because of funding pressures for other emerging diseases throughout the EU. This funding gap will have to be addressed by the remaining stakeholders and is a potent reminder of the need for collaboration and urgency of action to decrease the disease levels.",
                "The TB strategy sets out how the Department and stakeholders will continue to engage on the issues impacting on TB levels in Ireland, which will involve some difficult choices. By building our policies on a foundation of science and by providing practical science-based advice which farmers can act on to reduce their risks, we can together focus our efforts to protect cattle from infection and farmers from the stress, uncertainty and costs of a breakdown. Most actions set out under the current TB strategy have either been implemented or are advancing well towards implementation. However, we are at a point now where we have to consider whether we are, as a collective, prepared to make the difficult choices that may be required to make a step change. Some of these have been discussed at the TB forum. They include voluntary or mandatory informed purchasing; voluntary or mandatory risk-based trading; incentivising risk-lowering behaviours and disincentivising risk elevating behaviours; reducing spread between areas using contract rearing risk mitigation and restrictions on movements from high to low TB areas; dynamic risk estimation at herd and animal level; supporting quality TB testing using gamma interferon blood testing and spatial tools to identify each group of cattle; and reducing spread from high-risk herds by restricting older breeding cattle and confining TB exposed cattle to controlled finishing units. None of these options are easy for anyone but with stakeholder support, they have the potential to make a real difference.",
                "From the Department’s point of view, we acknowledge the legitimate concerns of those whose businesses and lives are affected by this disease. Equally, we have an obligation to use the best scientific evidence to reduce the risk of infection for herds that are currently free of the disease and to help those with chronic or repeating problems to manage their way out of them. We can only make real progress together and the Department is committed to constructive and collaborative engagement on all of these matters.",
                "We now have the building blocks in place to implement additional measures to the existing TB programme that can lower disease incidence and result in fewer farm families having to endure the challenges associated with a TB restriction. We are committed to constructive engagement with all stakeholders in helping the farming community. I hope that the next time we address the committee on bovine TB, we will be able to outline a positive picture of reducing TB incidence. I welcome any questions from members of the committee."

I do not know where we go from here. Everything has been tried. The last time the witnesses came before the committee I spoke about vaccination.

Given the amount of money we are spending and the lack of progress we are making, is there an argument to be made that we throw the proverbial kitchen sink at this with a pharmaceutical company, a scientific unit in a university or an expert in the field of science? Should we throw ten years' worth of TB money at this to come up with a vaccination? This will not be solved until we are vaccinating. I would like the opinions of the witnesses on that.",

Many of these things are ignored because someone thinks if they respond to say they saw a badger, they will have the whole Department down the following day. These measures are difficult to make work for many such reasons. What do the witnesses think about vaccination? Is there the potential to expedite it? This problem will not be solved until we are vaccinating.",

TB, by its nature, is one of those diseases where it is proven that developing a vaccine for a microbacterium, which is the type of bacteria that TB is, is significantly more complex than developing one for a virus like Covid. All things are possible, however. The crunch point here, as Senator Daly rightly pointed out, is differentiating between vaccinated cattle and infected cattle. That is being worked on.",

We have been discussing with them over the past few months potential measures that could be implemented to address that particular risk that can be acceptable to them, while at the same time reducing the transmission of TB from what we consider higher-risk animals and higher-risk herds. As I said to Senator Daly, those conversations with farm organisations are ongoing. I do not want to betray the nature of those conversations.

There is the assessment done on a dairy cow where the amount of milk she had is looked at to do the valuation and all that, but on the EBI something has changed over the last few weeks so there is between €50 and €80 less being got for the same cow than would have been got six months ago.

                "There was an EBI top-up introduced ten to 15 years ago, or more, at the time of the introduction of the EBI. At that time EBI was new and when farmers were buying animals it was not really built into the market value of an animal. The Deputy might remember it was back in 2000 or 2001 that the EBI was originally introduced. In the intervening 20 years I think there has been an acceptance of EBI among dairy farmers. It is built into farmers' breeding decisions and also their purchasing decisions, so when you are selling an animal on the open market the EBI is taken into account when somebody decides what to bid on that animal. On the live market valuation, the last time there was an EBI revision was over ten years ago. It was €1.05 per unit EBI. That was for the last ten years. In the intervening time EBI is becoming more and more incorporated into the purchase price of dairy stock by farmers, therefore the necessity of an EBI, or more accurately the extent of the EBI top-up, was not really reflecting marketplace activity because it is almost built into people's everyday decisions when buying dairy cattle. That is why it was reduced. The financial working group has started to meet again lately on doing a review of the changes introduced two years ago and one of the changes is looking at how we can use EBI better in the context of incentivising people to-----"

We can all say that pretty truthfully. We had the Minister in here yesterday and I raised this with him in the context of the budget that goes to TB eradication every year. I said that if a portion of that budget could have been put towards research into a vaccination programme ten, 15 or 20 years ago, we would be in a better place now.

If a cow has TB and a calf is born, does the TB carry through to the calf? If we had a vaccination programme and we started with the calves, how quickly do the witnesses think we would be in a situation where we would have the herd vaccinated across the State? Is it possible to put some kind of marker in? I get the point that the test for an infected animal and a vaccinated animal will produce the same result as things stand. Could a marker be put in to distinguish between vaccinated and infected animals?"

There is probably not the same level of research and development going into this although there is research on it. The other thing about a bacteria is that we should not underestimate it. We are all afraid of viruses like Covid and foot and mouth disease and they are considered to be relatively fast moving pathogens. TB is slow moving but it is tough and it has a couple of different complications that makes it very difficult to deal with it.

Most of the modern vaccines we deal with are either that or a variation of that. TB is a particularly difficult nut to crack.

Cattle will be housed within the next few days. There are exceptionally high levels of TB at that moment in that part of the world. When they are housed, the potential for the disease to spread through the herds is quite obvious. I know from my own experience on our farm that when cattle go in with a high level of TB and when we do our TB tests, we have chaos. What could happen here next January, February and March is something we will never again see. I genuinely think we are at epidemic levels in our part of the world.",

The level of infection in the community is at the highest level I have ever seen in my part of the world. The majority if not all of these herds are closed herds. That is an issue where the movement of animals is going to have an effect. I do not know if it will. These are dairy herds in particular. Some 70% of the national herd comprises dairy herds with animals that have been found to have TB. I have a great worry about what will happen.",
                "I want to raise a number of issues with the officials. What is the logic in having doubtfuls in the system? Why do we have TB tests for doubtfuls every six months after they are doubtful? That is the logic we have in the system. Were one to get rid of the doubtful, one would have to dispose but one cannot go through mart. There is then a knock-on implication that there is a value loss as a consequence. I do not understand why we have doubtfuls. This is coming from a farmer who has had doubtfuls. I have been involved in a TB test scenario where every six months we were TB testing the animal. When I realised that an animal was doubtful, I moved it on very quickly. Have we a pattern or policy for what we will do with the doubtfuls in our herds? It should be pass or fail. The farmer needs to have a financial reward if there is a fail. Otherwise, he will be caught in the middle and he is going nowhere. That issue has to be looked at.",

We have heard that there are not enough wildlife officers on the ground and that we are looking at a scenario where farm-relief services are involved and Department staff are not available. We have heard that there may be eight wildlife officers missing nationally. How many gaps are in the service and where are those gaps? We need to know where the gaps in the service are.",
                "On the potential for farmers' animals to go down next January, February and March, they will be stuck in a scenario where they have calves they cannot move. The percentage of those calves which will go down at 42 days is very limited. One might argue how can they get the infection unless they are getting the milk. If they are getting the milk, maybe there is a way around this. The welfare issue for the farmer and for the animals in a herd that is potentially locked up in springtime is enormous. It is frightening. I was there three years ago, and we still talk about it. We did not sell a calf until 2 July. It was chaotic. We got through that period, but it cost us a fortune. We need a solution for it. We have nobody who will take a Friesian bull calf. Therefore there are two options: one rears that animal or one does the disastrous job which is to slaughter the animal, which none of us wants to do as farmers. We have to find a solution for the 42-day-old calf. We have to see a proposal because the only avenues are to rear it or it will be slaughtered. We do not slaughter them. The stress caused by that is frightening.",
                "Take the high-incidence herd that the Department is saying could be the issue we need to look at. If a herd is then categorised as being high incidence, there is a financial impact immediately in respect of that herd. How will we then deal with that herd? Look at my part of the world. If you go to Ballinhassig, Barryroe, Caheragh or Drimoleague vast herds are all locked up. Parishes are locked up. We are potentially saying that trading from parishes could be stopped if that was to happen. How can that happen and what could the solution be?",

Instead of having two to a sett, there are seven or eight. That is one of the key issues. We have such large numbers in some areas. Has the vaccination programme increased the number of badgers and, in turn, also increased the volume of TB because there are not enough setts and there is not enough habitat? What have we considered around those issues?",

However, this entire thing is at epidemic levels in my part of the world. I am fearful of what will happen next January, February and March when animals are housed for six, eight or ten weeks when they are going in with levels of infection.

Herd incidences have reached very high levels. The fact the disease has been identified and the numbers he has spoken about indicate high levels of cattle-to-cattle transmission. We cannot say for certain how it was introduced to those herds but when one sees numbers like that there have been large levels of calf to cattle transmission. We would hope the efforts to remove the reactors has removed the focus of infection from those herds. However, it is worth bearing in mind that since 2019, from our analysis of what we call the healthy slaughters, that is slaughters from unrestricted herds, the levels of TB in that population rose 13% year on year between 2019 and 2023. That also increased the transmission to the badgers. There has been a rise. The detection of that rise really kicked in from mid-2023. It seems to have been surging ahead from mid-2023.",

It is unrealistic to think that vaccination is going to deliver that outcome on its own. We captured around 9,000 badgers last year for vaccination. That figure has doubled since 2019. We conducted some modelling research and it suggests that vaccination on its own and our current controls are insufficient to eradicate TB. This also suggests we need to break the link. We need to prevent the opportunities for badger-to-cattle interactions. This involves fencing off badger setts, raising water troughs and fencing off yards. Beet and maize in yards are two foodstuffs badgers are very fond of. They will need to be fenced off so the badgers cannot access those resources. The Department oversees the vaccinations but there is also an onus on farmers to break this transmission link themselves."

My other question concerns contamination. Mention was made of the risk posed by badgers and deer. This may be a stupid question, but should we have any other contamination concerns in this regard? I refer especially to removal methods. Is there any risk of contamination to members of the public, for example? I would like some clarity on this issue.

                "The purpose of today's meeting is for the joint committee to consider issues currently facing local drug and alcohol task forces. The meeting will be divided into two sessions. The joint committee will first meet with the Local Drugs and Alcohol Task Force Chairpersons Network, and later meet the Minister of State with responsibility for public health, well-being and the national drugs strategy, Deputy Colm Burke.",
                "Before we commence this consideration, a letter was received by the committee from Mr. Joe O'Neill of the Western Region Drug and Alcohol Task Force, who made a point regarding the ten regional drug and alcohol task forces covering all areas of the State outside of Dublin and Cork and that some of the issues and challenges facing regional task forces are quite distinct from those facing local task forces. It is a fair point and maybe a future health committee can invite representatives back in to revisit this area. This morning's meeting will focus on local drug and alcohol task forces and the submission of the LDATFCN.",

                "I thank the Chair and members of the Oireachtas committee for inviting us. I am the Chair of the Canal Communities Drug and Alcohol Task Force. I represent the LDATFCN here today. Chairpersons are voluntary and independent. Our purpose is to be a representative voice for the task forces. We have a strong collaborative relationship with the local drug and alcohol task force co-ordinators' network, and I am joined by Jim Doherty, one of our co-ordinator representatives.",
                "The local drugs task forces were a mechanism created more than 25 years ago to facilitate the involvement of local communities in the development of the services they needed to deal with the problems created by drugs use. Since then, task forces have been at the forefront of innovation and development of these services, often leading the statutory services because of their more flexible and responsive nature and their connections to the communities in which they are situated. We believe this remains our core strength today, and if the recommendations of the citizens' assembly are to be pursued, task forces are central to their success.",
                "Successive Governments have seen the task forces as key delivery agents and have enshrined their role in the national drugs strategies. The citizens' assembly undertook extraordinary work and commitment to offer the Government a comprehensive plan to address the needs of individuals and communities impacted by drugs. We commend the committee members colleagues on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Drugs Use on their recent interim report, which further strengthens this plan. The Government acknowledges that a health-led approach to the issue is paramount. Further to this, we welcome the finding of the assembly that the Government should apply a \"health in all policies\" approach to policy development. Task forces and their funded services are ready to work closely with statutory services to implement the assembly's recommendations. The current funding framework whereby most funding for task forces is distributed through health funding means there is no structural barrier to this. However, it will require a change in focus, leadership and a long-term commitment to the communities we serve, both through collaborative work and, most importantly, adequate resources.",
                "During the period from 2010 to date, health expenditure increased by 56% while drugs task forces have seen their funding decrease by 4.5% and have seen their resources steadily reduced over the past ten years. This is incompatible with a continued leading role for task forces, and with task forces being able to implement either their obligations under the national drugs strategy or the recommendations of the citizens' assembly.",
                "Local drug and alcohol task forces operate in the most disadvantaged communities in the country that have endured the long-term systemic impact of drug use and the wider implications of poverty, disadvantage and exclusion, often over generations. We are abundantly clear on the evidence of the impact of adverse childhood experiences on people's health and well-being. More recently, we have also had to acknowledge the impact of adverse community experiences. Poverty, violence and discrimination, lack of opportunity, economic mobility or social capital, and poor or inadequate housing all create conditions where moving out of drug use, and other challenges such as mental health, poly-victimisation, violence and criminality, is difficult. By continuing to under resource and underfund communities, we not only limit the chances of individual recovery, but also limit the potential for these communities to find the resources and resilience available within them. The future of drug policy in Ireland must be with the goal to not just reduce the harmful impact of drug use, but also to ensure that communities thrive and flourish, lessening the factors that lead to this problematic use.",
                "Task forces are committed to Sláintecare and equality of access and opportunity for all our communities. Ireland's population is growing and becoming more diverse, which is presenting new challenges for task force services. Of particular concern is the lack of a coherent strategy for engagement with drugs and alcohol use among refugees and international protection-seekers, many of whom are fleeing violent conflict, and bring with them much trauma and a desire to self-medicate. There needs to be urgent additional support for task forces, who are being asked to provide services to this population.",
                "The current model of channelling funding through statutory agencies presents complications when these agencies apply their own strategic priorities to funding intended for task forces. This sometimes means that new funding tranches do not reach task forces at all. This prevents task forces from achieving what we are most successful at; offering flexible, adaptable services tailored to the communities we serve. We fill a gap that national strategies and services simply cannot.",
                "We call on the Government to acknowledge the implications of its own commitments and to link the funding levels of task forces to that of the broader health services. This will allow us to serve our communities with confidence and commit to increasing their resilience to difficulties caused by drug use, drugs sales and drug distribution.",
                "Further to this, we ask that the committee ensure that the HSE recognises task forces within the forthcoming changes to its new regional structures. This can be done by funding, providing a clear organisational chart, which shows how representatives on task forces report into the new structures, and at what level, and ensuring that task forces are not overlooked in the new push towards population-based planning. This is necessary considering the clear evidence for an ongoing prioritised approach, as shown in the Health Research Board treatment figures. Task forces were established because it was recognised that not all populations are the same or should be treated the same, and it is essential that our role is clearly defined and properly funded so we can continue to succeed.",
                "If the Government is to be successful in meeting the goals of the national drug strategy, the recommendations of the citizens' assembly and the more recent recommendations of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Drugs Use, a substantial change in approach and engagement will need to be introduced. It is important that the agenda of Government is not frustrated by the strategies of individual agencies and we need to be seen as meaningful partners in this work. Given this, we propose the following: the role of junior Minister for drugs within the Department of Health to be established; the establishment of a cross-departmental committee on drugs, committed to progressing the recommendations of the citizens' assembly and the Oireachtas committee on drugs fully and in a timely manner; quarterly meetings with the Department and the chairpersons' network to be convened, and that these are planned annually - these should be offered with immediate effect; biannual meeting with the Department, the Minister and the chairpersons' network to be convened, and should be scheduled for 2025 without delay; and a gaps analysis commissioned to look at the structural disadvantages that local drug task force areas face. We welcome the recent confirmation from the Minister that all community workers will be included in pay restoration. Further to this, we require funding to allow organisations to offer competitive salaries, increments and pension contributions, in line with public sector workers. This is absolutely necessary if we are to address the chronic challenges of recruitment and retention in task force services. We also call for funding systems that prioritise the strategic goal of task forces with regards to their own budgets. The unique quality of drug and alcohol task forces is their ability to recruit the time, talents and commitment of volunteers such as board members, chairpersons, and committee members. To safeguard this quality, the autonomy and integrity of task forces must be protected.",

We have a lot of ground to cover and this is accentuated to a huge extent by virtue of the population increase in the country, increased demand in the country and increased addictions of all sorts.",
                "I was a member of one of these ministerial task forces a long time ago. It was useful but even though we had been active for a couple of years, we had not got to the stage where we had found the ultimate answer. We still have not the ultimate answer, that is, the strengthening of the link to bring to the centre of Government the necessities and acute demand on the ground and how best to make it happen.",
                "To my mind, two things need to happen. We have to deal with on the treatment level, including methadone treatment, and set up as many treatment centres as possible with the clear intention of reducing dependence on whatever the addiction is. Otherwise, we are not making a gain at all.",

                "We must also deal with supply. The rate of supply is appalling at the moment. It affects all schools, for instance, at primary and secondary level throughout the country. It affects children in a big way. What is happening is that the drug warlords are creating a dependency in advance of their market so they have a steady and guaranteed market based on the misery they create among people who are very often vulnerable. I note the points that have been made about the establishment of new structures and so on. How quickly do the witnesses anticipate the need to set up? What are the primary needs now? What is the most important thing that could be done now to deal with the problem in a meaningful way that is likely to have an effect without having to wait for three, four or five years to see the result?"

Those are cost free and it is about time they were re-established. Also required is the prioritisation of the task force's local drug strategy. The task force takes the national drug strategy and creates a version of that for the local area in which it acts. We need that to be prioritised, recognised and respected by all the agencies that are involved.",
                "We also need the Minister to have a much stronger focus on trying to bring in the other Departments. Education is a critical player in drugs task forces. We are charged with working with young people and we try so much to do prevention work with them. Justice is also a key player. The environment, in the sense of the local councils, is a key player. The Garda is a key player, as is the Department of Health. Unfortunately, the move to a health-led response has sometimes de-emphasised the need for the whole community of agencies to respond. That work needs to be prioritised and strengthened.",
                "Another thing that will do much to guarantee our future and our ability to implement the citizens' assembly recommendations is the linkage between our funding and the broader health budget. It is incompatible for us to say there is a health-led agency delivering health-led responses but its funding is going to go down by 5% over ten years while the health budget increases by 50%. If there is a strategic focus on what we are doing as part of the panoply of health responses, we have to be treated as part of the panoply of health responses. That has caused all sorts of difficulties and problems. We are not asking for a penny more than other health services get. We are just asking for the respect of being treated like that. We need the community of agencies to be brought together.",
                "The Department of Education decided not to attend drug task forces many years ago and engagement with education is at a low point. That is a critical point because if you are not at the table, you cannot continually express your policy and that has created all sorts of difficulties and problems for task forces over the years. When people think about drugs task forces, they think we are going to work for the young people and be involved. Of course, that is a critical part of what we do and we still do work with young people. However, we generally work in the absence of high-level influence within the Department of Education."

We must reduce the burden and show hope to the people who are affected, as opposed to imprisoning them for a start, which is not going to help at all. What is needed more urgently is treatment to reduce the dependency on whatever drug they are dealing with. As Oireachtas Members with constituency offices, we all know that there are various ways of dealing with them. The important thing is that we hold out some hope to the people. It is no good telling them that they are chronic addicts and the addiction will last forever while at the same time telling them we will put them in jail because that is the only way to solve the problem. That does not solve the problem. In actual fact, it makes it a whole lot worse. Who should be the co-ordinating body?"

We must also remember that the task forces are set up to have statutory, voluntary and community agencies working together. That framework is in place. Departments need to prioritise us and send that message down through the various organisations they fund and represent. We may have a HSE member or somebody from Dublin City Council but we may not have somebody from, for example, mental health. Given the emphasis on dual diagnosis, the local mental health care team or local primary care centre ought to be represented. We may not have a representative of education or Tusla. That is a top-down message. It has to be an expectation that organisations engage with these services. Drug and alcohol use affect every Government service that I can think of in one way or another. The idea that there is not that top-down expectation surprises me. I have been in the job for more than a year now. I worked in communities for 20 years. It surprises me that the top-down message is not there, given that task forces are set up to allow for that and with the expectation of that. Given where the funding comes from, what we already know and what was emphasised by the citizens' assembly, it should be led by the Department of Health, but the other Departments should see themselves as critical players and make sure that happens.",
                "The Deputy is right in what he has said about treatment. We need those treatment facilities. Many people need residential treatment. We know that particularly for communities where people have had struggles and difficulties, trauma being the most obvious one but other issues as well, their chances of remaining in recovery are less than those who have lived an easier life. That means that those community counselling and therapeutic options must remain. The Deputy said rightly that addiction does not have to affect people for the rest of their lives. However, some people may need support for the rest of their lives for that to be the case. The way funding is given now means that we do not have the resources we would need to ensure that free and readily available counselling is available to everybody who needs it. Funding is often given year on year. This is my voluntary role but my job is as a social worker and I do therapeutic work. There is an ethical issue with offering people therapy that might have to stop in six months and will not be there for those people. That is against any ethical framework I can think of but task forces are forced to do that every year. They must scrimp and save to pull in whatever funding is given, with €20,000 here and €10,000 there. They are told they will have the funding next year but may never have it again. It is unsustainable, unhelpful and unfair. We must have that availability. I agree with the regional task force that what different communities in different parts of the country face is different. Those communities need their own individual responses and task forces are the best people to do that."

                "The witnesses are welcome and I thank them for their presentations. The overarching point has been made well. Concentrated and problematic drug use does not happen in isolation. It happens, in the main, in areas of severe disadvantage, which is where the task forces are located. We can talk about the importance of co-ordination and all of that but it is budgetary decisions that influence the level of poverty in the country. I will make the following point very quickly.",
                "What we have seen in recent budgets is a widening of the gap between rich and poor, and that is the approach that has been taken. It is entirely political, and its solutions are political in terms of effective measures to tackle disadvantage, exclusion and poverty. Regrettably, we have not seen many of those in the last ten years.",
                "The witnesses' requests for new structures are very reasonable. The original idea when the task forces were set up in 1997 was that there was a national co-ordinating committee with very senior people on it, probably close to the most senior people in the relevant Departments, and that was operating within the Department of the Taoiseach. We also had senior people at local level as well. I have been a member of the drugs task force in Ballymun for a long time. I was also, for a period, on Mr. Hoey's task force in Finglas-Cabra. What happened very quickly is that those other agencies withdrew from the whole process and, basically, they did not want to know. The Chairman will be aware of this from his own experience; they really did not want to know. The concept of a health-led response is fine in theory, but it does give people in other Departments an out, as the witnesses have stated. I know from dealing with people at a senior level in government that most of them do not have a clue about how to address poverty and exclusion, or they do not want to know, and no effort is made. At various task force meetings, I often used to think that the thinking used to be that senior people will influence things, but actually the education was going the other way. The task forces were educating senior officials from different Departments regarding what the issues were and their solutions. In the main, they did not want to know.",
                "What Ms Bairéad proposed regarding the establishment of a cross-departmental committee on drugs is very important. She said she thought it would sit under the Department of Health. In many ways, I think it should be in the Department of the Taoiseach, because the teeth of the Department of the Taoiseach are needed to get people to do their jobs, to perform and stop this tendency of just leaving it to the Department of Health. I also completely agree with the idea of having senior people locally. Apart from withdrawing from the local structures, what happened was that agencies sent along junior people who did not have any decision-making powers, and that has been the problem. What the witnesses are looking for in terms of the structures seems very reasonable - maybe overly reasonable. Can the witnesses talk to us about the engagement they have with the Department of Health and the Minister at the moment? Is there any functioning body that involves other agencies?"

I think I am right in saying that the contact we have with the Department is at a fairly low ebb. One of the reasons we are asking for things to be scheduled and planned ahead is that it is very difficult to pursue an agenda when there is uncertainty about when the meetings are going to happen. It is probably the lowest level of contact that I have ever had in the 20 years I have been a drugs task force co-ordinator. That is a situation that needs to be addressed immediately.",

I am also old enough to also remember the national co-ordinating committee for drug and alcohol task forces, which did not do an effective job. The national oversight committee, which as I understand still exists, does not seem to produce effective, useful decisions and policy recommendations for us either. We are saying the structures that are in place are definitely not working. Regular engagement and contact would be a good way for us to start reviving those structures or building new, more effective structures. That would be the priority for us right now. It would be better for us to have a better relationship - this is not a comment on the present Minister's attitude to us - in terms of more frequent meetings and more easy conversations, because if the Minister has responsibility for us, we need access to him in order to articulate our concerns."

Issues could be brought there and could be addressed there and people had decision-making capacity.

However, as the Deputy said, we were in the Department of the Taoiseach and had a Minister solely concerned with drugs, and now we are in the Department of Health and have a Minister who also has lots of other jobs.

That again speaks to why having local funding is important, because the profile of what people use and why they use it differs across different communities. It can also change remarkably quickly, often with what is available. Therefore, having a very flexible approach that tailors the services to the community and being able to adapt as they need to is very important. For example, over however many years I have been working, there are these surges of certain drugs, and they change very quickly.",
                "We need services that can adapt to that. The fundamental difficulty with people who continue to use drugs or cannot stop using drugs and on whose lives that has significant problematic impacts is that there are other huge issues in their lives. It cannot solely be about focusing on one treatment or another. We have so many decades of research now that we know why people start using drugs, cannot stop using drugs and then return to drugs. Many people in many communities start using drugs. The other two are factored very much in deprivation, poverty and trauma. We also see the impact now of how, as was referred to earlier, gangs will tailor drug availability and drug use to bring in new people. That is absolutely true but if we do not have this co-ordinated approach to addressing it, those people will continue, as somebody said, to fall through the cracks or, as another person responded, to fall through the canyons. That is how it feels.",

Maybe that needs to be in the Department of the Taoiseach. The Deputy would be much better able to decide how these political pieces work. As somebody on the ground, what I find difficult within that is why another Department would not hold that grave responsibility. Why does it have to be siloed? Why is it if it is your responsibility, it is not mine? That seems extraordinary to me, given what communities face. The idea that if one Department has it, nobody else needs to touch it is remarkable. I have been coming to this building for, I think, 15 years in various forums. It has been said in so many forums before that it may be about children, education, drugs or poverty. It has been repeatedly said that one Department-----"

To those who are not familiar with it, DRIVE is a national policy approach to drug-related intimidation. One thing that we do locally and that many task forces are doing is building it within the nexus of family support. Since the previous iteration of the drugs strategy, family support has become a recognised service offering for drugs task forces for a number of reasons. One is that family members are often permanent people in the lives of drug users and are well placed. If we can train them a little bit, they will be well placed to offer continuing and forever support to that person. In addition, families are the ones who are targeted by drug-related intimidation and its victims. The approach many task forces have taken is to try to offer family support services and then have a close relationship with the local gardaí. Local relationships with all of these agencies tend to be great because you know the person and it is good. If I can make a slight criticism, although I know it is not something the Garda can necessarily do anything about, the turnover of people in Garda positions can cause difficulties, simply because so much of it is based on personal relationships."

The elephant in the room that many people do not want to talk about, however, is the regulation where the black market essentially controls all drugs. This is the irony at the end of the day. Controlled drugs, which are on the statutory books in this country, are not controlled by the State. They are controlled by the black market.

We have had 50 years of this and it simply has not worked. We need something different. I have cited this again but public opinion has moved on in this but certain elements of the Government and Departments have not. In fact, they are happy enough with the status quo where working-class communities destroy themselves and are allowed to cannibalise the black market as well as the horrible thing that go on with drug dependency and the drug trade. You have to tackle down-the-line issues and take control of certain drugs that are unregulated.

We know these things to be true. We can, therefore, either address the problem at that level, and know that is what we are addressing, or we can keep on pinpointing the problem drug, labelling it cocaine this year, heroin three years ago and benzodiazepines five years ago.

One of the quickest ways people seem to move out of those traumatic response behaviours is to move out of poverty. That is the evidence. We can either take an evidence-led approach or we keep on trying to silo the problems as being about this drug or that drug or whether a drug is legal or illegal. The problem is about the hurt, trauma and harm being done to people."

Deputy Kenny touched on a similar point as the one I wish to make. Why is there a lack of political will in this particular area? There is no doubt but that this issue is at the end of the ladder of priorities. I find it frustrating in the work I do with The RISE Foundation.

                "To use an example from my own work, I have undertaken a lot of research which shows that one of the strongest protective factors against drug and alcohol use for children is staying in school longer. School is often a great source of stability, safety, warmth and, sometimes, nutrition for children in the areas we move in. Keeping children in school longer protects them more than a lot of other things we do. We work locally to try to facilitate children with learning difficulties to stay in school. That is not work, however, of which I may ever see the fruit. If we make an intervention with a six- or seven-year-old, it is extraordinarily difficult for me to measure the impact it might have on that person when he or she is 21. It is almost impossible and very hard for everyone in this room. It is, therefore, difficult to make strong cases for allocation of scarce Government resources towards such interventions. Despite this, those interventions are likely to be the ones that ultimately will have the greatest impact of all because if we keep one person out of Mountjoy Prison, we save the State multiples of everything that we spend on six- and seven-year-olds.",

Even as a task force co-ordinator, it is difficult to make those arguments to funders. It is, however, the area where we effect long-lasting change by improving people's lives and keeping them in education. When they stay and do better in education, they will have more job opportunities and broader horizons for their own lives, which will lead them to function better within their families and all these kinds of things. It all feds in but I am not sure it is something that can be measured on an Excel spreadsheet in the next 18 months.",

For a child who was refusing to go to school but is now going to school again, we need to look at the impact that might have down the line on that child's life chances. There is plenty of sociological research in this regard. It should not be impossible for us to calculate that and weight our efforts towards work like that. As Ms Bairéad said, there will be another drug next year to which we will react. There will be another type of addiction and we will react to that also. Ultimately, however, we have to try to stop the conveyor belt of children needing those drugs."

There is an extraordinary lack of curiosity as to why so many people in those communities continue to do well, survive and keep their families as healthy as possible. They are seen as problems, which are then individualised into drugs, poverty, housing or education. The fact that they all culminate in the same area is recognised but there is nothing beyond that. Not only is there a lack of recognition but there is also a lack of respect for how extraordinary the people we work with are. Most of the people who work in drug task force services are from those communities and are dedicated to strengthening those communities. While some of them end up in places like here to represent those communities elsewhere, they are on the ground doing work all day every day to make their communities better.

We share the same vision but the approach taken is shaped by the expertise and experience of those in the driving seat. Engagement is simply not enough. We need innovative ways of sharing our expertise and working as a collective. What is the consensus among local drug and alcohol task forces in this regard? When working with statutory bodies or funded services, do they feel they are influencing the direction of a programme or shaping it? What changes can we make to bridge the gap between different organisations that share a common goal? Will the witnesses say a little bit more about that.

That speaks to some of the organisational deficits and interactional deficits we have with various Departments and senior officials in various Departments we mentioned earlier. As a key delivery agency that will very much be part of implementing some parts of Sláintecare, our voice is not necessarily being expressed loudly enough within the direction of how that will be implemented locally. That speaks again to the weighting conversation and the recognition that the complexity of the communities we deal with and the complexity of the problem are really an order of magnitude different from many other health services. I am aware that all the health services have their challenges. My wife works in St. James's Hospital so I am acutely aware of the challenges of standard health services. Because our area has that overarching reach into justice, education, family support and other issues that cannot easily be captured on a health metric, there is a complicating layer for us. That conversation feels lacking and feels more lacking now than it has felt for 20 years. It feels like that conversation is not sufficiently expressed and sufficiently heard. As people have said, we have a lot of experience of our communities and we know them very well. It is not a question of saying we are not going to do this but of saying here is how we could do this better.

We all accept it has been a fault line or a weakness in the system that those key players or people of influence are not around the table. If members agree, this is certainly one of the issues we can raise with the Minister. It should be a recommendation. It will be agreed by most people familiar with this situation that we are moving back instead of moving forward.

I do not think there is a sense of that as part of debates or at meetings and so on. What does it mean when we say it has never been as bad? One of the things it means is that the age profile of those involved is getting younger and younger. We hear of kids of seven years of age partaking in illegal drugs, including nitrous oxide. People used to talk about cannabis as the gateway drug but this is the one that is really frightening out there. It is amazing the number of people that do not know this. They start off with these silver bullets and then it is huge containers. The challenge is that these are legal and illegal. They are illegal to consume but they are legal for bakeries and coffee machines and so on and are needed for such uses. I put forward simple legislation that, much like cigarettes, you could not sell it to kids. Again there seemed to be consensus among everyone on that but we were not able to move the legislation to do that. It seemed a simple thing we could do.",

It does not have immediacy and \"now\" currency. I hate to think that Government policy could be dictated by such things, and I do not believe it is because there are far too many thoughtful analytical people involved.",
                "If, however, we look at the trajectory of our location within the Department of the Taoiseach to where we are now and the trajectory of funding and interaction from the other Departments, it is difficult to draw alternative conclusions. That is why I really welcome the Citizens' Assembly because it is seemed to refresh our idea that this needs to be a national conversation.",
                "The Chairman is absolutely right in everything he said about fast gas, but we have to prioritise our approach in every area. For instance, we still have conversations about whether Naloxone is available. Someone else mentioned drug-related deaths earlier. Naloxone is one way - it is not going to solve all drug-related deaths - we can tackle and reduce some drug-related deaths. Yet, it is not yet freely, totally available in a very clear and totally accessible way to families, drug users, service users or service providers. It is available through restricted access to certain classes of people.",
                "We need to just push past the barriers on things like that, but that is about getting the urgency back into the conversation. Drug-related deaths are an extremely good place to start because our rate of drug-related deaths is really high. It should be given the kind of primacy we once gave when our rate of road deaths was really high. It was actually about the same as what our rate of drug deaths is now. It became a national conversation and we did make great strides in road safety. Therefore, we need to have that conversation."

Many of us thought that with the emergence of crack cocaine in communities, women being turned into prostitutes, people going into houses without a stick of furniture and children going hungry it would be a wake-up call. It is probably only certain communities, however, and we talked about that. Cocaine per se is impacting on all societies on all levels whether someone is a chief executive or otherwise. It is a normal part of life. One cannot go into a pub or social setting in which people are not using. It is normalised in that regard and it has an impact.",

It was a simple step of giving the hospital information about services that were in the community. A piece of work was carried out on that. A pilot was done, and the money ran out. That seemed to be a simple health solution, yet it was not replicated right across the country in other hospitals in other areas. We do not see people learning from a lot of the simple things that can be done with regard to this.",

The one thing that comes up when we talk to all the drug task forces, whether they are regional or the 14 that are based around the cities, is that idea of emerging needs and how we need to be flexible enough for the new drug that is coming down the track."

One of the difficulties he mentioned earlier was that because we have such short-term funding and the way funding is done, it is really hard to recruit and retain staff, particularly if people move into, say, the HSE and other places where they will get pensions and permanency and all of that. Because so many of our services are literally in survival mode, the time and energy it would take to share the information we have and give it to Government so that it would know is not always there. Often, when things come up or when new funding comes up, we are scrambling to try to get as many people as possible together to get that funding into place and again, because it is done in short-term small pots here and there, even just that process takes an extraordinary amount of time. Therefore, not having the staff we need means that we cannot collate the information we know we have. Certainly, it is much harder to co-ordinate that nationally. We have the chairpersons' network. They are volunteers; we are all volunteers. Most of us do our very best to do that. However, those things have such huge consequences because we cannot retain and recruit the staff we need to work and function the way we need to. That is such an important part of this moving forward."

                "The Government’s policy on drug use is set out in the national drugs strategy, Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery 2017-2025. The central tenet of the strategy is that drug use should be dealt with as a public health issue. It advocates for a compassionate response to individuals who use drugs. The programme for Government reiterates the health-led approach to drug use and the shift to this approach to drug use continues to evolve. Drug use is a dynamic situation to which policy must adapt in a flexible manner.",
                "Our strategic priorities include prevention of drug use among children and young people; access to, and delivery of, drug services in the community and harm reduction responses and integrated care pathways for high-risk drug users; the social determinants and consequences of drugs use; alternatives to coercive sanctions for drug offences; and evidence-informed and outcomes-focused policy and implementation.",
                "In 2024, the Department of Health provided funding of more that €160 million for the provision of drug services. Approximately €65 million or 40% of this funding is allocated by the HSE to community-based organisations. Drug and alcohol task forces play an important role in supporting the implementation of the national drugs strategy in communities by co-ordinating the response to drugs at local and regional level. There are ten regional and 14 local drug and alcohol task forces in operation across Ireland. They are responsible for supporting the implementation of the national strategy, Reducing Harm, Supporting Recovery 2017-2025, in the context of local population needs.",
                "It is important to acknowledge the contribution of the independent chairpersons and the members of the task forces to addressing drug issues. The independent chairpersons play a key role in bringing together the various stakeholders to work together in a collaborative manner. The work of the task forces is supported by the HSE, which employs a co-ordinator for each task force and provides the channel of funding for the services overseen by the task force. In total, the Department of Health provides more than €28 million in recurring funding for drug services and related initiatives overseen by the task forces. Of this, €18 million goes to the 14 local task forces, with annual funding ranging from €1 million to €2 million. The €18 million represents 11% of the funding allocated by the Department of Health every year for drug services, and 28% of that allocated for community-based services.",
                "Since 2020, the Department has allocated a total of €13.1 million in additional recurring funding to support existing community-based services and develop new services. This additional funding has been allocated on the basis of population across the nine community healthcare organisations which have recently been amalgamated as six health regions. While not ring-fenced by individual task forces, the additional funding has benefited drug services across all task force areas.",
                "The drug and alcohol task forces contribute to the priorities in the national drugs strategy and are represented on the oversight structures for the strategy, including the strategic implementation groups. These groups are responsible for implementing a range of actions in the strategic action plan for 2023 and 2024. One strategic priority to which the task forces contribute in a major way is to enhance access to, and delivery of, drug services in the community. Drug treatment demand has greatly increased since 2017. In this period, the number of new cases treated for problematic drug use has grown from 8,922 to 13,104, an increase in new cases of 4,000, or 47%. From 2022 to 2023, the number of cases increased by more than 1,000. The local task force areas account for just under half of the total number of new cases in 2023. The remaining 53% fall within the geographical remit of the regional task forces.",
                "There is geographical variation in the number of people accessing treatment for the first time, with some areas recording a higher demand for services than others. This increase in treatment cases reflects growing demand, as well as the additional investment under the national drugs strategy over the past few years in expanding access to, and availability of, treatment, for those who are seeking help with addiction issues. As Minister of State with responsibility in this area, I have prioritised investment in drug services to ensure these are available to all those who need them and in all locations where they are needed. This is in line with the Sláintecare objective of ensuring equity of access to healthcare services.",
                "To better inform the planning and funding of drug services across the new health regions, the Department of Health is undertaking an audit of drug services. The first output of the audit is an interactive map of 442 publicly funded services across the country. This map suggests an uneven distribution of services, as well as a fragmentation of services across the country. The next step is to audit current service provision, based on treatment demand and population need, to inform the planning of drug services in the new HSE health regions.",
                "Another strategic priority which the task forces support is addressing the social determinants and consequences of drug uses in disadvantaged communities. I recognise the additional challenges arising from drug use in communities where there are high levels of poverty and deprivation. Poverty and deprivation are government-wide issues which affect employment, education, housing, health, policing and community safety.",
                "The Department of Health and the local task force chairpersons network jointly convened a conference in May 2023 to examine local responses to problematic drug use. The conference highlighted the importance of a joined-up approach involving Government Departments and local stakeholders, including the drug and alcohol task forces and the Sláintecare healthy communities programme. One aspect of drug use that has a corrosive impact on families and local communities is drug-related intimidation and violence, DRIVE. A recent initiative developed by the task forces and supported by the Department of Health is the DRIVE project to address this violence.",
                "DRIVE is an interagency project set up to develop systems and structures across the country, facilitated by the local and regional drug and alcohol task forces, to support people who experience drug-related violence.",
                "The Department of Health is the lead sponsor and funder of the DRIVE project and provides annual funding of €250,000 to support the work of the project. The Department of Justice, An Garda Síochána and the Probation Service are also key partners in the project. An Garda Síochána has appointed 30 inspectors who are totally focused on this issue.",
                "I recently met the chair and co-ordinator of the DRIVE project to discuss plans for a national awareness campaign on drug-related intimidation. This campaign aims to address issues of stigma and fear, to deliver a message of hope and to advise people of how to access help. I acknowledge the positive, collaborative working relationship between the Department of Health and the chairs of the drug and alcohol task forces. In August, I met the chairpersons network to outline to them the additional funding being provided to sustain community-based drug services, covering both operational and staffing costs and I understand a further meeting has been arranged for 11 November. Funding of €2.3 million was allocated to sustain community-based drug services and support people in recovery. In addition, Department officials meet the chairpersons network on an ongoing basis to address operational and governance issues and to provide updates on new funding opportunities.",

I acknowledge that the implementation of the recommendations of the citizens' assembly will require a major step-change to develop a comprehensive health-led approach to drugs use. The deliberations of the Joint Committee on Drugs Use, which recently published an interim report, are also relevant to strengthening this approach. The vehicle to implement the recommendations of the citizens' assembly is the new national drugs strategy. It is proposed to prepare a draft of the next national drugs strategy in early 2025 informed by an evaluation of the current strategy, the Government response to the recommendations of the citizens' assembly and the Joint Committee on Drugs Use and the 800 submissions made to the citizens' assembly.",

I look forward to continuing the positive working relationship between myself as Minister, officials in the Department of Health and the chairpersons network and to having regular engagements on issues of common concern. As Minister with responsibility for the national drugs strategy, I am fully committed to ensuring we move forward with a health-led approach that reduces the harms of drug use, supports recovery and provides measurable benefits to the lives of everyone affected by the use of drugs."

The problem appears to be co-ordination of the efforts of all concerned throughout the community and throughout the regions and local areas. It would be of huge benefit if someone had overall responsibility, as Deputy Shortall mentioned. I am not sure that one overall person is the right way to go about it, but we have an opportunity now to make recommendations to the next committee, whoever may be on it, and the next ministerial task force as to how to proceed. What appears to have happened is that the thinking is good. Everyone has the right intention, but it comes to a halt between election times and different things that seem to divert attention to other areas of equal importance. It is now necessary to give an informed opinion to the next incumbents of the position of this committee and of the task forces and to pick out the most salient parts of the fight against drugs, including the medical part, rehabilitation and dealing with the drug problem in general. We heard earlier that liberalisation of drugs is the answer. It is not.

We must ensure they are all joined up and people understand what is available in that ecosystem of health services and community and voluntary services.

We could be in a cycle talking about the same thing in ten or 20 years' time.

People are being intimidated and money is being paid because a member of the family owes money to a dealer. This is about a co-ordinated approach. As I said, 30 Garda inspectors have been appointed around the country to co-ordinate within each individual region of the Garda force. The idea is to make sure that we can provide assistance to anyone who is feeling intimidated. People do not have to go to the gardaí. They can work with the different groups locally too. Over time, they will maybe get the confidence to report the matter to the gardaí. It is about trying to support them where they are intimidated. I have had to deal with at least four or five of those cases. They are all difficult. The idea with the DRIVE programme is to provide information about where people can get assistance."

It can be established at a neutral venue so they can sit down and talk to people. The gardaí have become involved in an amazing number of cases over time after people did not go to the gardaí on the first day but went to one of the other State agencies for help. Then the State agency worked with them and eventually gave them the confidence to meet the gardaí privately and to move on from there. It is important that people who feel intimidated and that they are on their own know that they are not on their own and that support will be provided. It is important that we spread the message that support will be provided in the community and also by the gardaí. People who are intimidating others are taking advantage of the situation.

It is then a matter of trying to deal with the addiction issue and then come back to live a normal life again. It is a slow process with a step-by-step approach. It is important, where someone is in a treatment or residential facility, that we have somewhere for them to go once they are finished in that treatment facility. Likewise, we need to make sure that when people end up in prison, they have somewhere to go when they are released from prison and they are not back out on the street where they have no place to go.

                "I am pleased to present the public service performance report for 2023 for the Department of Transport. The report contains high-level metrics on the delivery of investment and services in each of the five expenditure programmes published in the 2023 Revised Estimates.",
                "Looking at 2023 in its context, since 2020 there have been key shifts in investment into new policy areas, aligning with the scale of policy ambition of this Government, in delivering compact growth, improving regional accessibility and working to deliver on our climate commitments. We have developed specific strategic network plans and can measure progress against delivery of those plans. This includes flagship infrastructure programmes such as BusConnects, DART+, MetroLink, and the electric vehicle charging infrastructure strategy. We have moved from relatively low investment in active travel to designing and steadily delivering comprehensive, integrated urban and national networks with a particular focus on accessibility, with major investments, for example, connecting the North and South Quays in Waterford or Donabate and Malahide in Dublin. We have continued our investments in the national road network with several major road projects completed in the life of the Government.",
                "We have ensured that integrated transport plans have been developed for regional cities and can now see the benefits under way with major construction works ongoing at Plunkett Station in Waterford, Kent Station in Cork and Ceannt Station in Galway, repositioning these stations as modern, connected, multi-modal transport hubs. We are steadily replacing existing ICE public transport fleets with low-emission vehicle and zero-emission vehicle fleets and have made major progress in improving and greatly enhancing public services through BusConnects and Connecting Ireland. We have made significant investments in aviation and maritime safety and security, supporting our regional airports and delivering an enhanced Coast Guard service.",
                "Many of the metrics published reflect the progress we have made, but also highlight the downsides. Unwelcome trends include the increase in road fatalities and the slow progress in decarbonising transport networks. Although the pace of progress of major transport projects through the planning system has been slow, this too is now steadily ramping up with the Cork commuter rail project well under way and the first BusConnects corridors due to go into construction next year. As our plans develop, what we measure will evolve with those plans.",
                "I will turn now to some of the specific metrics for 2023. I will take programme A, sustainable mobility – active travel and greenways, first. This is primarily a capital investment programme, with expenditure exceeding the budget for 2023 due to strong programme delivery. Output indicators focus on the kilometres added to the active travel and greenway networks during 2023. The National Transport Authority is broadly responsible for managing the active travel programme and Transport Infrastructure Ireland is primarily responsible for the delivery of greenway networks. Impact data for 2023 is derived primarily from the cycling and walking index and the Dublin city canal cordon count. For example, the available data in the walking and cycling index for Dublin, included in the Revised Estimates Volume, shows a measurable improvement in areas such as perceptions of safety in the period between 2019 and 2021. As of 2023, the index is available for all five cities’ metropolitan areas, which hugely expands the range of information available.",
                "In 2023, programme B, sustainable mobility – public transport, focused on progress in public transport investment and in electrification of private transport networks. In the 2023 Revised Estimates Volume, indicators were grouped into broad categories: EV grants, EV infrastructure, public transport asset purchases, public transport infrastructure and public transport services. EV and home charging point grant demand remained strong, preceding the much-discussed dip in 2024 for EV demand. In 2023, the total number of registered EVs as well as the percentage of EVs as a share of total car sales continued to rise. Key investments in 2023 included the ongoing programme of upgrading, replacing and expanding bus and rail fleet assets. The types of impacts selected for the report show a steady rise in public transport passenger numbers as well as growth in the size of the public transport network.",
                "Last year, programme C, road networks and road safety, broadly divided the outputs into the addition of new road infrastructure as well as the maintenance of existing infrastructure. The kilometres of new roads relate to the completion of major schemes such as the N5 Westport to Turlough scheme in County Mayo, and the N22 Baile Bhuirne to Macroom scheme in County Cork. The metrics published in the Revised Estimates Volume contain further information on the types of assets being maintained in the asset maintenance programme, for example bridges and lighting. The impacts indicate rising demand on the use of the road network, but also the area of road safety. We know from available CSO data that the number of vehicles travelling per kilometre is trending upwards, which confirms what intuitively citizens may feel as the economy and the population continue to rise steadily. The metrics highlight the concerning increase in fatalities as well as the work of the Medical Bureau of Road Safety testing for road safety influencing factors such as drug and alcohol specimens received from drivers. The metrics also measure the working of the driver vehicle and licensing service in Shannon, including the transactions processed through the national vehicle and driver file.",
                "In programme D, metrics generally measure compliance with safety and security, which is the main focus of investment, alongside operational grants and public service obligation schemes. The impact indicators show a steady increase in passenger throughput, again reflecting the rebound over the 2021-23 period from Covid restrictions.",
                "The metrics in programme E primarily reflect the work of the Marine Survey Office and the role of marine surveyors in ensuring the safety of marine vessels; and the work of the Coast Guard in responding to marine emergencies within its remit.",
                "The Department of Transport also has responsibility for the collection of nearly €1 billion each year in motor tax receipts for the Exchequer. Total receipts in 2023 were €911 million. The majority of this is collected through the easy to use and highly efficient motortax.ie website run by the Department. The Department also provides the back-office IT system of the local authority motor tax offices for those choosing to pay in person. My Department continues to look for new mechanisms to improve our digital customer service offerings to citizens while not leaving anyone behind who wishes to engage with us through non-digital channels.",
                "The examination of our programmes through the lens of the public service performance report is a welcome development as it offers a great opportunity to discuss policy, delivery and the progress on matters of concern to the committee, and to the citizens the committee represents on behalf of whom our work is undertaken. I am happy to take any questions that the committee may have and I presume my officials might be able to add to the discussion if that is appropriate."

                "I refer to programme A, sustainable mobility – active travel and greenways. Specifically, there has been massive State investment in active travel projects. I reference the R135 project in Ashbourne with a specific focus on value for money, oversight and delivery on time and on budget. This was a project that was initially welcomed but is now despised by the populace in the locality. It is a project that cost €6 million. It commenced in April 2022 and was due to run for 65 weeks until June 2023. The project is still ongoing. It has had a massive impact on traffic and business in the town and on people's mobility in the town. It has had an incredibly negative impact as we are told when canvassing and knocking on doors. For me, it is the perfect example of how significant projects should not be done. It has left a really sour taste in the mouth of the local community. It also has a knock-on effect. This project has essentially overrun by 100%. We do not know the cost overrun. It could be well in excess of 100% overrun but we do not know. We have asked those questions of Meath County Council and we will continue to pursue them but they say, similar to the children's hospital, there are disputes in relation to some of the issues and they are before the courts.",
                "However, we will pursue this and find out exactly what the cost overrun was and why it happened. It also has an impact on other projects. Today, I received a response from the NTA stating that funding for an active travel project in the neighbouring town of Ratoath is not available because of construction inflation and increasing costs associated with these projects. There is frustration about that among local public representatives. It raises the question of the oversight and value for money of these projects and ensuring that contractors and local authorities ensure that projects are rolled out efficiently and there is good oversight of the spending of taxpayers’ money. Is the Minister familiar with this case, or are there other examples he wants to comment on?"

                "The overall impact of what we have done on the active travel programme is transformative. It has taken a number of years to scale up the capability of many local authorities to spend. In the first two or three years of this Government, while the funding was increased, a lot of it was being put into resources within councils like building up design teams, active management teams and ready-to-go project designs. There were often also significant difficulties getting projects through our planning system. That did not apply to all projects as some were section 38 projects and so on, but others required planning permission. It has taken some time to scale up the ability of local authorities to deliver on the targets we are setting in terms of kilometres of segregated cycling facilities. That is really starting to change this year. It is now increasingly focusing on delivery. As part of that we need to learn lessons. If there have been difficulties in Ashbourne in terms of not keeping to the originally planned timelines or budget - I do not have the details - we need to learn from that experience to make sure it is not repeated.",
                "We also have an issue now because of all the good design work that has been done. We are starting to have a significant number of projects ready to go to construction. While the active travel budget of €350 million is significant, it is a real constraint and we will have to prioritise some projects over others. I will say one thing, and this will be for the next Government, in which I obviously will not be involved. At various meetings we have been pushing the initiative that we should prioritise those councils that are willing to make some of the investment choices, and particularly the difficult decisions. I do not think this can all be forced from the top down. It has to come from the bottom up from councils looking to do it themselves. Those councils really willing to spend money with the most impact should be the ones to which we direct funding. Those who are not, it is their decision if they are not really going for this, and we have to measure council performance in that regard. That is fine. It is their call, and the money will go where it is most wanted and most needed. That may also help where councils are seen to be quick and effective in spending the money. They should be the ones we make sure get access to finance in the coming five years. That will help to be one of the best checks to make sure we spend the money wisely, well and quickly."

This project had €6 million allocated and a 100% overrun in terms of time. I expect it is a 100% overrun in budget as well, and maybe more. It was to be one element of a network of developments. What does the Minister imagine the response will be if the local authority comes back for the next leg of the development? People do not want to see sight nor sound of it. That is the reality, because of the negative experience. There is a need to put a framework in place to ensure these projects are monitored and evaluated, and that local authorities, and particularly developers, are held to account in this regard. There also needs to be consideration of the wider implications of such disruption in areas. I regularly meet with businesses. They say there is an impact on their incomes because of the disruption. This issue has been raised in Ashbourne and in Navan, in my own county. Is there some accommodation that can be made for loss of revenue or to properly understand the impact of delays in projects like this, and the impact they have on consumer behaviour or shoppers' habits to ensure that local businesses are not impacted? Some businesses would associate the ongoing works with significant loss in income and the potential impact on jobs and the viability of businesses. That is not something that anybody wants to see, and it needs to be factored into it. I encourage oversight of these projects. We will continue asking questions on the Ashbourne project. I have concerns about the delays with it, but also what I am sure are the associated cost overruns. I do not think that serves anybody well. We need to see these projects delivered and delivered well."

                "I accept that. There is significant oversight. The Department has oversight of the NTA, which is the approving authority. We do regular overviews of the broad range of projects going through. The NTA has specific oversight with the local authority at the project level. It is important to be able to measure success and accountability. I will make two other relevant points. One of the characteristics in 2022 and 2023 was high inflation. We had significant material and contractor inflation coming out of the war in Ukraine and higher energy prices leading through that inflationary period. It has thankfully come to an end, but that was quite significant. With regard to active travel, there was a period as we started to ramp up this investment where there were different sorts of solutions. People will be aware that a lot of areas had wands drilled into the road and space was segregated in that way, or there were other technical ways to create a safe space. We are starting to see an evolution in some of that. On a lot of roads now there is just a small lip to a segregated pathway - it has to be segregated - with a particular surface. The advantage, as we have learned with these solutions over the past three or four years, is that it is now turning into quite a standardised approach. The design manual for cycling infrastructure will help a lot with this. We need to standardise. That brings various benefits. It reduces the cost, but it also reduces the length of time in construction, because you have teams that are used to how they do things, and they can run down a road and deliver quickly. I do not know the specifics of the Ashbourne case, which the Deputy mentioned. I accept what he says. There may be other reasons for delays. It may not have had cost implications. You could have a gas main or some other issue. You have to wait for the gas network company to repair it and so on. The delay might not necessarily be due to a project overrun from the contractor doing the cycling provision. However, I agree that we need to work fast. In that way things are also more efficient and less expensive."

In fact, when I was Mayor of Fingal, it got a mention in my opening remarks because the collapse of the bridge which had happened relatively recently. It is fantastic to see projects like that. I was reared walking the byways and highways of this country with my parents who were avid walkers with a walking group called Na Coisithe, which my mother is still involved with 40 years later. I spent a huge amount of time every second Sunday down the country. These greenways mentioned by the Minister in his opening remarks and, indeed, in the public service performance report, PSPR, are very welcome.",

As a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action, I have had regular engagements with the Minister on this issue over the years. My own local authority, that is, the four Dublin local authorities working together, published their plan recently, which is most welcome. I cannot help but feel that momentum was lost because of the length of time it took them to produce that documentation, those plans and locations. Is that a common theme across the local authorities in the productions of those reports and site identifications? Can the Minister comment on that?",
                "My other query on EV uptake is on the rather worrying figures, or perhaps the Minister has a contrary opinion, on how we are progressing with the EV uptake in 2024. I appreciate that we are looking at 2023 but could the Minister elucidate his, or the rationale of the Department, for that reduction in uptake as a percentage of the market and whether there are regulatory barriers in Ireland that are presenting in that? Perhaps the Minister might address those points initially."

                "Absolutely. First, on what the Cathaoirleach has said about greenways, it is very true that their popularity meets so many different needs. We need to design greenways. I always say to TII, to which we have given the task, that it must remember that this is for local use first and foremost. The local use might be someone cycling, jogging. Its primary care might be for those going for a walk and that everyone else has to respect that local need because it has to work for everyone. Cyclists have to yield or be respectful of pedestrians but then there can be a whole range of different uses. One could go fishing on a greenway by a bank or river and it is a case of seeing them as that important architecture for local communities right across the country. That is really important.",
                "On electric vehicles, the Cathaoirleach is correct in saying that we have seen a slowdown in 2024. That has been right across Europe but less so worldwide as in China and elsewhere, they are really taking off. In Europe, in particular however, there was a reduction in the demand in the past year compared with the previous year. There are, in my mind, a variety of different reasons for that. It is complicated. The primary reason was changes in the second-hand value of the EV market, which made people uncertain, particularly if one had a three-year leasing model where one might have to purchase the full vehicle back at the end of the year or, indeed, in selling it on. If one is uncertain at what the second-hand value is, that hinders the confidence in the purchase of new EVs.",
                "There are separate issues. The issue of range anxiety was an issue in the public mind but in my sense, particularly in Ireland, this is one we can address for a variety of reasons. First, we actually have a widespread network of EV charging infrastructure compared with other countries. We had one of the first roll-outs of EV charging infrastructure but there is a certain concern around the ability to get access vehicles, particularly if one does not have one on one's driveway but also on having more destination charging points in other areas. We had to make a strategic decision in 2023 into the 2024 budget, where we reduced the EV grant. Some people argued that perhaps that should not have happened. I do not think that was the primary reason because in truth, the actual price of new electrical vehicles continued to fall and fell quite significantly. The reason we made that decision was not necessarily to disadvantage EVs, obviously, but was because we faced the choice of making an investment decision in the charging infrastructure and we wanted to prioritise that to overcome those range anxiety concerns. We allocated a €100 million budget to that, which is very much starting to kick in. We will start to see in the summer of next year the roll-out of the high-speed motorway charging infrastructure. We will see the roll-out to 200 sports clubs of EV infrastructure supported by the State. We are also advancing the local authority plans.",
                "I agree with the Cathaoirleach on his assessment on the long time that has taken. Local authorities, for a variety of different reasons, have been reasonably poor. I believe that the Cathaoirleach's own local authority, Fingal County Council, was one of the better ones but it has not delivered as quickly as we would want. We are starting to see real investment beginning to take place but that was something which took longer and was more protracted than it should or could have been.",
                "There is one other project which may help in that regard and, again, it is taking some time. We are committed to using funding from the Climate Action Fund to set up mobility hubs. We will probably take three locations, two cities and a large town, where we will put in some innovative EV charging for both bikes and cars for car sharing and bike sharing and that will complement what the local authorities are doing. That is only one of the widespread and wide variety of measures on which we are starting to spend that €100 million in respect of the charging infrastructure, as well as what the private companies are doing. I had a meeting last week with the Electric Vehicle Charging Alliance of Ireland, which represents about half a dozen companies. There is competition and there is a variety of suppliers and they were telling me that even aside from the Government-supported charging locations, that they are continuing to invest very significantly. Consequently, I believe we can overcome that.",
                "The slowdown in EV sales is starting to taper off and we are beginning to see it rising again. When the issues of second-hand values, fleet and leasing are resolved, it will really accelerate further again."

In addition, the number of new buses and coaches delivered, all with low floors, is only 57% of target. The Minister also might touch on that. I obviously commend the reference to achieving 126% of target for new buses and coaches delivered which were zero-emissions vehicles, ZEVs. I was on one of them with the Minister a couple of years ago as part of the Committee on Environment and Climate Action.",

Part of that will involve much more sophisticated use or assessment of data, not just in Dublin but in other regional cities, on modal split, journey performance and what is happening. The counting we are doing includes the likes of the canal cordon count, which people will know. It is typically done in November of each year. It measures the number of people going across the canal. Technically it is a good way of checking a particular volume of traffic, but it does not really tell you much about what is happening with transport in the city. Our data analytics unit will give a much more real-time assessment of what is happening and, in particular, what is happening before and after a piece of infrastructure is put in place in order that the impact can be measured.

That IT system is also used by the motor tax offices. There also needs to be a printing facility for the tax discs. It has not happened so far. As the Deputy may be aware, we are planning to remove the need for paper motor tax discs over the next year or so. Once we do that, it will open up a lot more possibilities for making it easier for motor tax to be paid in other locations and through different channels."

I have to agree with that assessment. We did not always agree on things and we are probably not going to agree today but I thought I would start off with a softening blow rather than a tough one.",

Aviators have told me it should be in the scrapyard, rather than undertaking a new life as top cover for Ireland.

The current top people in the Coast Guard have gone a long way to undo some of the harm that has been done to people locally. When we are all gone out of here, I would like the Department to engage with the Coast Guard, try to repair the bad feelings there are in certain parts of the country and try and bring people back into the fold. I realise the safety responsibility they have but the people who have been pushed out were all highly safety-conscious people.

I only realised this time in government how embedded the organisation is in communities right around our coast. I had the pleasure of visiting a number of our Coast Guard stations in the past four years. There have been difficulties in particular areas. While I agree with the Senator’s assessment, we have had major transformation of the Coast Guard and a programme is under way, including the appointment of an assistant secretary in my Department as part of that leadership team. The organisation has a very long and proud history and I am confident it will go into a very significant new phase of development.",
                "We have been looking at metro north for 25 years or more. We should proceed with the metro. I am waiting - impatiently in a sense - for the planning decision on the metro. We need that central spine running from Lissenhall through the centre of north Dublin to the southside at Charlemont. In the future, that spine will continue to Tallaght. I was involved in Platform for Change to plan transport and land development in Dublin. That central core spine was always in all the modelling. It is absolutely critical for all the institutions, including Dublin City University, the Mater Hospital, Dublin Airport, the Rotunda Hospital, as well as O'Connell Street. It is also critical for the planning and development of the city. A high-capacity route from north to south, extending to Tallaght in time, is critical.",

There are various difficulties with that. It would require us to significantly four-track the rail line north of Connolly Station. It would take multibillion euro investments to make sure that running a rail service to the airport would not disadvantage commuters coming from further north. We have just seen, as the Chair will be aware, the controversy in recent weeks over changes to the timetable on the northern line."

I am not sure if the Local Link initiatives are in the Minister's area but they have made a huge difference in regional public transport. I did not think we would be able to reach such levels of service but people who never took a bus in their lives are now travelling to Sligo town from Coolaney, Ballisodare, Ballymote and Manorhamilton. Local Link is not just for student travel. It is for night-time travel and the night-time economy. We need to do an awful lot more but in the past three or four years that money has been well spent. It was a wonderful initiative and we should reflect on that. I thank the Minister.",

We were concerned that with only three areas it could be lost, but I am delighted Strandhill has been included because 12 years ago I was very involved in the initiative of bringing the air ambulance to Athlone following the closure of the Roscommon accident and emergency department. I brought three different Departments and it has been a huge success. I am aware these things have to move and be upskilled and upgraded, but that was a game-changer when it came to saving lives in rural areas such as counties Roscommon, Mayo, Galway, Sligo, Leitrim and across the island.",
                "We talked about the greenways. Again, under the Minister’s initiatives, they have received huge amounts of funding. I think of the Sligo greenway from Charlestown to Collooney. We would love to see a railway line there as well but the greenway is progressing at pace. Down the road I would like the Minister’s views on a railway. We would like to link up eventually with the Sligo to Galway line and down to Limerick as well, with a connection to Knock airport. We are very proud of the airport. It is used incredibly well by people from the west. When I go to Westminster, I can leave my house in Sligo at 8 a.m., be on a flight at 9 a.m. and in Westminster for a meeting at 11:30 a.m. When I am asked how I got there, I say it was Ryanair and it cost me €19.99. We are very proud of the airport. Most people are going for their winter holidays. These things are happening. The greenway from Collooney to Enniskillen is progressing. We have a feasibility study on the greenway between Lough Key forest park and Carrick-on-Shannon. It will link to Drumshanbo and up to Ballinamore and Roosky. We are at a critical point where we can connect all these greenways together. What the Minister said was right. We live in a temperate climate, although unfortunately it rains a lot more in Sligo and the west than it does in Dublin, but you could be on a bike every day, or an electric scooter or bike.",
                "I normally stay on the Navan Road and take the bus in. What the Minister has done in Dublin has been very positive. Many more people are using the cycleway north of the Liffey. We are moving to a level of scale that is very welcome. I thank the Minister for all those initiatives. Everyone is talking about the Luas and whatever, but I am more worried about the Sligo line. The train to Sligo takes three hours. I am aware there are difficulties between Mullingar and Connolly Station, but we need to try to come up with some resolution so the train can get from Sligo to Dublin in less than two hours. I would like the Minister’s views on that.",
                "If we look at the map of Ireland, there are motorways to Wexford, Waterford, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Belfast. We need to do a lot more in the north west. The Carrick-on-Shannon bypass is moving at pace. The one area we had a little disagreement was the N17 between Collooney and Charlestown and also from Roosky to Mullingar. I thank the Minister because there were issues we perhaps did not agree on, but he listened and we came up with a resolution that I think was agreeable to everyone. However, it caused a lot of confusion and anger and we need to do a little bit better when it comes to the provision of roads. It is not a Green policy and I can understand that, but where I live, people feel let down because they are looking at motorways in every other area across the island and we need to be sympathetic to that. As I said, the speed limit on the N17 between Collooney and Charlestown is 80 km/h. It is simply not good enough for a major route and I want the Minister and his officials, who do great work, to maybe take into consideration that we do not have those motorways. The Collooney to Castlebaldwin dual carriageway has been a game-changer. Every time I drive on it, it lifts my heart as I can see the scenery and things like that, but we need more of it.",

                "On investment in transport, public transport and roads, maybe I will bring them together. I have a perspective looking forward, rather than back to 2023, that the country has never had a more significant budget surplus or financial resources. It is quite phenomenal we find ourselves with the likes of the Apple money and being able to invest in the Future Ireland Fund and the Infrastructure, Climate and Nature Fund. However, even with that very significant positive situation we have compared with any of our neighbouring countries, the challenge facing the next government and the one after that is really hard choices in the transport area, because we have so many projects in development. All are valid and a very strong case can be made for them, but we will not have the funding even if we were to get all the Apple money. Even if that largesse continued, we would still have a deficit in what could be spent. It is also an issue about engineering and contracting resources. I keep coming back to the point that three or four years ago when we were starting this version of the national development plan, we were very glad to get an allocation of €35 million in this period for the NDP, but we recognised we had €100 billion in projects in development and that was before the inflation that occurred in the past two to three years and before other new projects came onstream.",
                "One of the biggest concerns I have is I see that investment coming in Dublin with a real certainty because Dublin is ahead. Dublin has been 20 years thinking about some of these projects, like the metro and so on. That very significant funding is going to come to Dublin because a lot of the projects have come through planning. Out of the 12 BusConnects projects in Dublin, nine are through planning and I expect the metro to be through planning within months, please God. DART+ west is through planning and the north, south and south west DART+ projects are also in planning. In the neighbouring area around Dublin, we need a rail line to Navan and the extension of the DART to Wicklow. All these have rock-solid cases and will have to be developed because Dublin needs that infrastructure. However, the problem we have is if we just develop in Dublin and do not develop in Cork, Galway, Waterford and Limerick as well as in towns like Sligo and in the north west in particular, we will not deliver the balanced regional development we all want. That is not good for Dublin as well as everywhere else. It would just put property prices up further. On that, we are starting to play catch-up in this Government. We have delivered a lot in the form of very extensive plans for the development of metropolitan rail in Cork while in Waterford we are seeing projects already starting to be delivered, including new rail stations and there are upgrades of the railway stations in Galway and Limerick. However, that is only really scratching the surface. We need to go with BusConnects projects in each of those cities and also continue outside them.",
                "I absolutely accept what the Deputy said at the start. Connecting Ireland has been a phenomenal success and we need to continue for the next five years to do what we have done for the past two, where every week we roll out a new or enhanced rural bus service. It is quite expensive, but it is hugely beneficial for rural development and regional balance. I could go on. The western rail corridor needs to be up there as a first priority. A rail link to Shannon is another priority, as is reopening the rail line from Wexford to Waterford. All three of those could then be part of regional metropolitan rail networks. I am only scraping the surface. Roads are needed too. We need the Carrick-on-Shannon bypass and the Virginia bypass. I agree on the N17 and the likes of prioritising the Charlestown bypass. Again, I could continue to Ballina, Foxford and all those towns where we have plans. Every time I went west in particular, I met representatives of local councils who were saying if they could only get the traffic out of Ballintubber, Ballinrobe and so on, it would transform those towns.",
                "We should be investing in those projects quickly because we have a chance with remote working to get town life back.",
                "The difficulty with having the election is everybody will be saying there is money for everything, that we will be able to build everything and do it quickly. That is not true. We probably need the next NDP to be part of what is a 20- or 30-year project in respect of building out this scale of new transport infrastructure. I would argue public transport needs to get priority; not only because of climate emissions though those are real, but because of the type of development it brings. It brings transport-led developments. You get new housing beside where the public transport is put in, which works very well. More than anything else, the Irish people want it. They love public transport. When a decent public transport service is provided, everyone flocks to it. The problem we have had in the past is we have not put the money into public transport. In truth, we have allowed it to wither and that needs to be reversed in the next five, ten and 20 years. I am convinced that doing that will transform the country for the better."

                "I thank the Minister very much for his service. We have known each other for a long time in different ways. He was the TD for my area for a long time and when I was a councillor in the same area, we would go to the same residents' meetings. Indeed back in the 1980s, he was the person opening the bike shop in Belfield, when bikes were hardly being talked about at all. He does not just talk the talk; he has walked the walk in that regard. I am going to touch on the public service performance report based on his program A, B, C, D, E and so on. On active travel, while we will talk about public transport in a minute, it would be beneficial if we could get people out of public transport and on to their bikes, as I travelled today and as I do on as many days as I can. The Cathaoirleach will be glad to know I cycled to the Grand Hotel in Malahide last week, which took an hour and ten minutes from the city centre. As the DART would have taken about an hour because of the connections, I decided to try it. It can be done although I am not saying I would do it every day. Those shorter journeys; certainly anything inside the canal or as far out as Goatstown, where I am based, are very doable. It is faster than the bus and the Luas. We have reduced fares considerably but it is not so much about the money. It is good for our health also. Everybody on a bike is taking a car off the road or creating another space on the Luas, which at certain times of the day, as the Minister well knows, is quite full. This is particularly the case on the green line on the south side in the area where I am from. If we can provide quality wide bike lanes where people can overtake one another, it will make cycling more viable. I am not sure about the concrete strips. I was listening to the Minister earlier and while the diverting might be okay, I note the number of times when there was a concrete strip on the gutter and where people were tripping over them and banging into them. If they are wide enough and people know they are there that is one thing, but I am not so sure the big blocky ones that were there at one stage are the right way to go. Once you are inside them you are inside them and if you are stuck behind somebody it gets very frustrating. The wider the lane the better. Where there is space to do it and it can be done it is very positive. It is about delivery, as the Minister said. Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown certainly has been one of the better councils in terms of delivering cycling infrastructure. It pays off. I was cyclist number 810 this morning on the cycle counter outside Belfield. I will not give the figure but at this stage, the counter is in the hundreds of thousands this year. I remember in the 1980s, when Clonskeagh had two lanes of cars. They converged further down and that also caused problems. There is an appetite for it and the more of it we can do, the better we can maintain the bike lanes. We were talking about the capital spending on active travel earlier but I note the wands get knocked over and broken. They are at an angle or are sticking out in the wrong way. There is a maintenance issue there and while I do not know whose budget it is or whether there is a budget for it, it needs to be maintained.",
                "The level of broken glass is something that frustrates me as I have had more punctures than I would like because of it. It happens. It could have been swept yesterday and it would happen today. There is nothing we can do about that. The more we maintain those lanes, however, the more people get out of their cars. That leaves road space for people who do need cars.",
                "Touching on that, I will bring in road safety as part of it. We know that average-speed cameras on the N7 work. The RSA appeared before us and told us the compliance rate went from 67% to 98% in that stretch. There is much more scope in terms of technology inside people's cars. There are people who, when their children start driving, put a box in the car that monitors them and gives a report if anything goes wrong. Nothing goes wrong as they know they are being watched. We all behave better when we are being watched. There is an incentive there for the insurance industry, together with the Department. We are never going to have enough average speed cameras. By and large, as we have said before, the four risk factors for road deaths are generally young people at night on rural roads at weekends. We are never going to have average speed cameras in those areas. The Minister might reflect on the active travel end of it and on road safety. I might come back to some of the other things."

All we are doing with that is storing cars. They are not moving, which means there is no space for anything else. It completely killed the cycling capability. Cyclists had to go on the footpath, there was literally no space. What we need to do is reallocate space. It is not anti-car; it is creating a transport system that works. Each time we do it, we do not go back because one finds that transport flows change. What is often being changed is where the congestion is, not where the actual capacity is.

Thankfully, there has been an improvement in the past six months. Any deaths on our roads are still completely unacceptable and the figures are still high relative to two or three years ago but in the past six months, we have started to see the numbers improve somewhat. There were 16 less lives lost this year compared with this time last year. That is not acceptable, we need to go much lower, but the figures are starting to turn. One of the reasons they have started to turn is because we have increased enforcement. Members of the Garda are doing 30 minutes of their duty rosters on road traffic police safety improvements and that is having an impact on public behaviour. Cameras also are a very significant part of that. Not solely the average speed cameras but cameras regarding the enforcement of bus lanes, speed-----"

                "The Stillorgan quality bus corridor, QBC, was the first ever QBC. A change is coming on that route in December. I remember when there were three lanes of traffic on the N11, which were then funnelled into two in Donnybrook village. Now it is two lanes being funnelled into one, which is not as bad. Again, it is about taking out cars. The impact of taking a lane of cars out of Donnybrook village in 1999 was apparent to most road users at the time, and certainly most drivers, yet it works. We have seen gigantic levels of traffic on the 46A, 145 and 155 routes, the latter two of which I do not think even existed as those routes prior to the opening of the QBC. There is work to be done there. All the route numbers are changing, with the 46A route due to finish on 8 or 9 December. That will be a shock to a lot of people. These are very heavily trafficked routes. It is about communicating the changes well in order that people realise the route is not gone but is just being renamed and new routes are being introduced. A lot of the S4, S6, S8 routes and so on are quite good but not everybody may know about them. What is being done is progress but we must make sure we communicate that progress. QBCs work but only where they extend the whole way along a route. It cannot be a stop-start situation, with a little length of strip on one part before it changes at the lights. Decent QBCs work. They promote and justify higher density. However, there is work to be done in this area.",
                "I mentioned camera monitoring of red lights. Will the Minister outline his thoughts on the establishment of a transport police force? Progress in this regard is an evolving process. The Dublin Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party group looked at this a long time ago. The response in an earlier period of this Government's term to the possibility of establishing a transport police unit was \"Not really\". Now it seems to be more accepted that there is scope for such an establishment, whether within An Garda Síochána, which I probably would favour, or, if it has to be, as a separate force. It should cover public transport and also perhaps road safety and road monitoring, not just for 30 minutes per day but involving people whose full-time job focuses on transport measures, all the enforcement and, in particular, antisocial behaviour. If public transport is not viewed as safe or experienced as safe, it does not get the traction we want. We know it does get traction when that issue is addressed.",
                "In terms of bus capacity, any time I have cycled down the quays, which is much easier to do now, I see very significant numbers of people waiting for buses. That is the case pretty much all the time. I am not saying it is a bad thing; in fact, it is a good thing. However, my question is whether our transport network has enough buses to cope with the increased demand. The population has increased by 50% or thereabouts in the past 25 years from approximately 3.5 million to more than 5 million. It is a very significant jump. We have a much bigger working population, with 1 million more people in the workplace now than there were ten years ago. The increase is from about 1.8 million to 2.8 million. Have we done enough to make sure that when we ask people to use public transport, it is there for them? I am not just talking about the ghost bus issue but the need to ensure that when the bus turns up, there is a seat for most people most of the time. We do not expect that at rush hour but most people would like to be able to sit down. Everything in the public service performance report is good but we need more ambition. What is being done in this regard?"

Getting down to the very local, the question is about what Donnybrook village, for instance, is for. Is it a distributor road for cars into the city centre or is it a village for the local community? My view is that it is the latter. Another example is Ballsbridge village. I use it a lot as a pedestrian and cyclist. The current configuration is horrific. It is utterly dismissive of the pedestrian. The situation with timings and the ability to cross the road is awful, dangerous and completely car-dominated. The centre of Ballsbridge village should function as the centre of the village.",
                "One of the changes that will help and benefit us is BusConnects. It will not impact on Donnybrook but it will impact on Ballsbridge. The latter is one of the three projects that are not yet through planning. It will give an opportunity to calm down the whole village and change it from being a car distributor route into the city centre to a place that facilitates high-quality public transport, cycling, walking and cars. It is not about taking the car out completely. The current situation in Ballsbridge is the same right across Dublin and in cities and towns across the country. We have allowed our urban areas to become car parks and car transport systems. That takes from the sense of place and community, from health and from efficiency because it leads to gridlock. It just does not work and it has to change. What we see at present is not good enough. BusConnects will be transformative. The projects are coming on board. Two will start next year and another two will probably get going as well. We will be building four a year. There is no reason we should not complete BusConnects in the next four years and, in so doing, really transform the city for the better. I do not see that stopping. As I said earlier, that is an absolute first priority. We got the proposals through planning. Now let us build.",

I had a meeting with the board of Dublin Bus two weeks ago. What came out of it is that we have enough buses. We have to electrify them all and we must think about how we use our depots. Included in that, going back to Donnybrook or Ringsend, both in my constituency, is considering whether we could build over the bus stations If we have electric buses, we will not have the fumes or the same noise. There are really good continental examples. Ringsend depot is built on very valuable land beside Grand Canal Dock. We should be building above the bus depot there. We should retain the depot because it is an important part of the public infrastructure but we should get housing in at the same time. From talking to people in Dublin Bus, the critical thing will be turning around bus times more quickly. If we can give BusConnects the real priority we want to give it, then it is not the number of buses but the speed of the buses that is the key metric. Getting the speed up should be the focus rather than necessarily having to put more buses into a gridlocked system."

With the BusConnects projects coming on stream under the A spine, the proposal is to reduce that time to 40 minutes, which is a pretty decent time for a journey of approximately eight miles. Comparatively, the DART time is 28 or 29 minutes from nearby Malahide, with the MetroLink, when delivered, taking 25 minutes.",

I am a huge advocate for the delivery of that project, but there is undoubtedly extraordinary cynicism in the public domain. When I am confronted by people who say “Oh, that should have been delivered 20 years ago,” or “It was started 20 years ago,” I tell them that it was actually first suggested in 1974 in the form of a heavy rail link from the northern commuter line. That was the first iteration. A metro or underground was suggested in 2000, or possibly during the 1990s. We are where we are, as they say. My ambition, the Minister’s and that of these Houses is to get this through planning and started as quickly as possible. In view of all the meetings the Minister has had with Dr. Sweeney and others in his Department in recent years, will he give a prediction as to when he thinks this will start and finish? If the Oireachtas committee structures are put back together in January or thereabouts, I hope we will be in a position to call in Dr. Sweeney for a conversation.

I agree with him. For where we are now, that would be a great outcome and we should make sure it happens but that is not satisfactory because it started in 2016 or 2017, so that is 14 years to build a bus corridor network. The problem is it was a controversial project because the designs were wrong at the start. They were very much corridors over communities and not getting that sense of villages back. In fairness to the NTA, it listened and that public consultation process through three phases won over most of the public and, in my experience, and won over councillors and TDs, but by the time it is built, it is ten years later. It is 14 years to build out from end to end. That is too long. Not only it is too long in that you do not get the benefit, it is also more expensive. The benefit of public consultation is that you get the public with you and then there is a ten-year gap. That does not work. The reasons are many but our public spending code needs to be updated. That does not help in terms of the number. You need checks and you need to make sure it is good value for money and so on. That process is quite protracted. There are lots of gates involved.

There is also the injunction relating to or the judicial review of the airport passenger cap, which I was going to raise later. That is a good example of the courts dealing with something relatively quickly. It only took a few weeks, as far as I know. The decision was made this week. Regardless of one’s view of the move by the DAA and the airlines, I hope that is an indication that even though it is a provisional view, that matter will be dealt with by the courts or An Bord Pleanála definitively in the near future. Regardless of the planning process, perhaps park that and move to the implementation and delivery of the process. Is it still eight years? Can that be revised? Has Dr. Sweeney been able to get his teeth into the pre-tender consultation process? I believe he has been involved in it since his appointment, or the Metrolink team has been involved for some time. That might answer the question."

There have been positive developments recently, such as the decision to establish and create judges for the environmental court. We are starting to see some decisions fairly quickly. I think it is the uncertainty. I could list a number of other cases where it could be two or three years. There is no real clarity as to why it takes so long and it is a very expensive process.

We built a motorway network on time at a relatively low cost by European standards. We also built the Luas lines pretty much on budget and on time. It was difficult, but there was good engineering. This Government rolled out the national broadband plan, which is not a small engineering feat. The plan has been hugely successful and was done on budget and on time. I could go on. Other countries are looking to copy what we are doing in the context of retrofitting. We can and will do it. Dr. Sweeney and colleagues will say, “Get this done quickly and get a good price”. One of the biggest constraints to which I keep going back is the financial provision. It will be a very expensive project. The more we can keep the cost of that down, the more we can fund other projects which we need to do in Cork, Galway, Waterford and Limerick. Time is one aspect.",
                "The way to do that is to give real certainty to those developing and bidding that this is well planned, which it is, resource the bidding process and make sure there are people with Dr. Sweeney on the State side who know this business inside out. That helps to bring down the cost. It often revolves around resourcing the planning and the State side when dealing with other operators because that de-risks their bid process, which brings down the cost. They will bid competitively, and several serious players will bid. Getting that aspect right is why the appointment of this person to head the office and the staff to support him is important. Metros have been rolled out in Paris, Copenhagen and cities similar to Dublin on a regular basis. It is not new technology. It is standard kit.",

                "Perhaps I will comment on that point then. The airport cap and the metro were mentioned at the same time. They are connected. The airport cap came from our planning system and not our political system. It came from a recognition that we were really constrained on our roads around the M1 and the M50. The M1 is our busiest, most congested and most constrained road system, as are the roads around it going to the airport. This is real. Having been involved in this issue for many decades, I remember talking to the Arup engineer who designed the widening of the M50. We put in all the Red Cow upgrades and all the massive M1 and M50 junctions around the airport. I remember asking the engineer if that was it and he told me that was it. He said we could do no more, there was no way to expand the capacity there because it was at its maximum. With absolute certainty, it was said the road would gridlock.",
                "I was involved in the planning hearing for the widening of the M50. I think the inspector's name was Devlin. We presented the analysis to show it was guaranteed to fill up, which is where it is now. There is this really chaotic system where it gridlocks if there is an accident or any sort of change. The roads around the airport are the same. This situation cannot be changed by building more roads. That is the first premise. This is a constraint on the airport. If the airport continues to grow, and it will do so, and it is a car-based transport system, we get tailbacks of many miles. Was it two-mile tailbacks that were modelled recently in respect of coming and out of the airport? The whole thing does not work then. The M50 gridlocks. There was, therefore, a reason the cap was put in place. I mention this background because it is one of the other cases for the metro. I mentioned the metro earlier. It is really a spine to build housing up in Lissenhall and Swords, all the institutional connections and having a north-south connection. One of the other benefits of having a metro is that it addresses the traffic capacity issue around the airport, which is a physical reality that cannot be ignored. It is a mathematical certainty that we will get all these massive tailbacks unless we have public transport alternatives."

I suppose the cap was probably put in at a time when the airport was dealing with about 15 million people a year and it was never thought we would get to 30 million. A figure was just pulled out of the air of 32 million. I do not know why it was 32 million and not 28 million or 36 million. The feeling was that we were never going to reach the cap anyway so it did not matter, but here we are now. We have just spent over €300 million on a second runway, over €50 million on a tower to look over and observe the second runway, and now we are saying we should have less activity than we had before. I get what is being said about people living near the airport wanting certain quiet times in respect of night flights and so on. I do think the metro will do a certain amount, but, equally, it is about there being buses from everywhere and frequently. Who the hell wants to drive to the airport and pay €43 or €50 daily in the short-term car park or even €10 or €20 in the long-term car park if they can get the Aircoach bus?

                "It is one or the other. There is certainly a huge amount of bus activity. In 2007, I think it was 1% or 2% of people who were travelling to the airport by bus, while it is now about 34%. This should, though, be 54% or 64%. The metro will help, but not everyone is coming from the city centre or from the metro line. Many people from outside Dublin are using Dublin Airport. If you happen to be in the car park, which I rarely am, you can see a great number of Northern-registered cars. People from the North are coming down and using Dublin Airport because it has got such good connectivity. Again, this is really about providing the transport services. The better, the more reliable, the cheaper and the more frequent, the more people will use them. I think we need to keep working on this.",
                "We talked earlier about the Stillorgan quality bus corridor. It got people out of their cars. Everywhere we can, we should be trying to get people out of their cars. I am not talking about rural Ireland, about Connemara, Clifden or Ballyconneely. I know the Minister is very familiar with those areas. I am talking about areas where there is volume and there is density. Why would I drive in here, even with a free parking space, when it would take half an hour when I can get in on the bike in less than 20 minutes? It does not make sense. On the airport, I think we need to get rid of the cap and not just to raise it. If we raise it to 40 million, we will be back here in five years to raise it to 45 million or 50 million. It should not be there at all. Equally, however, we should be trying to stimulate more regional airport access. I know the Minister has done a good job in this regard in terms of the regional airport programme.",
                "The Minister has so many great State agencies under his remit. Most people would love to be the Minister for Transport because everybody's life is impacted every day by transport. People get up in the morning and wonder how they will get to work and if they will be facing gridlock at the end of their roads. As the Minister knows, the Luas was transformative for south Dublin when it started in 2004. It just became a magnet that sucked people in. Those living 15 minutes and 20 minutes away from the Luas were willing to walk there because the tram got them to where they wanted to go. There was a guaranteed service and guaranteed journey times. It was worth the walk. It was not about building car parks for everyone and it cannot be.",
                "The Minister has made a real impact on people's lives. All the people working in all the agencies under the remit of the Minister and his Department have agreed to meet us. They have come here to this committee. I was privileged to have been the Acting Chair and Leas-Chathaoirleach for almost two years when Deputy O'Donnell was promoted to be Minister of State and the former Deputy, Joe Carey, was sick. We may take transport for granted and it is only when it goes wrong that we talk about it. In some ways, this is probably always the way it is going to be. So much has transformed, though. I was on the Dublin Regional Authority, as we touched on earlier, in 2006, and in 2003 and 2004. If I drove in then, because there was no Luas and the bus would not move, I would be leaving my house at 5.10 p.m. for a 6.30 p.m. meeting because I could not be sure I could get in on time any other way. The M50 transformed people's lives too. The Minister will remember that it would take an hour at any time of the day to get from The Goat to Knocklyon, through Rathfarnham and Churchtown, in the 1990s before the advent of the M50.",
                "Much has been done, therefore, and the public service performance report is good. I thank the Minister for his service. There is, though, plenty more we can do. At some point, I would still like to see the Minister's Department looking at the eastern bypass, not to build it but to examine the corridor that is still there, through Knockrabo, down through Belfield, across by the Radisson and out to the sea, for light rail, cycling routes or whatever. It is an opportunity, but if it is built on, we will never get it back.",
                "We are only touching on the transport aspect today. In the context of the Minister's other Department, we are really going to have to ramp up addressing cybercrime. We have ramped up this activity and we are continuing to do so. We would all almost not exist without our phones, computers and email. We are using them for payments and real-time information. We must ensure our IT systems are robust, right across the State and in private and public settings, to ward off attacks from nefarious activity."

It is something I really want to talk about in relation to the airport and I do not want the Minister having to double up on his answers. The Senator was talking about the multimodal means of people getting to and from Dublin Airport. The Minister spent some time talking about capacity issues with the local road network and all the rest of it. Future capacity, however, is something equally important to me. By future, I mean when the Minister and I are at the grand opening of the metro in Lissenhall in eight or nine years.",
                "We will then be able to get to the city centre in 25 minutes. However, people coming down the northern commuter corridor from Louth, Meath and north Dublin - I hope we will by then also have the beginnings of the Navan line reopening or DART+ West along the Kildare lines - will all have to get off at a DART station that interlinks with the metro to double back on themselves. When I say Meath, I mean both Meath by the sea and central Meath. They are two different Meaths as far as I am concerned. The point I am making is that not having a connection from Lissenhall or Clongriffin to the northern commuter line does not make an awful lot of sense from a long-term planning perspective using the mathematics the Minister mentioned earlier regarding the capacity of the road network. I just wanted to put my oar in on that one and to say that, as part of the implementation of the all-island strategic review within the Department of Transport, while the northern commuter connection from Clongriffin to the airport by heavy rail is mentioned, a continuation or Luas from Lissenhall to Donabate should be provided given the planning and spatial strategy capacity of Donabate that has been around since the 1990s and that is currently being delivered. That should happen at some point. It does not have the necessary population today but it will in ten or 15 years. Dublin Airport has been relatively successful at managing ground traffic. The percentage of journeys taken by bus is 35%, if I am not mistaken."

I would like to think there is capacity for us to start talking about that because we know how long it takes. We have discussed at length how long it takes for us to deliver these projects. We should start having that conversation now. If you check with Fingal County Council and the Department of housing, you will see there are just over 11,000 people living in Donabate and Portrane at the moment. There will be well over 20,000 living there in 15 years with the amount of development that is happening. There are two roads. One is a former farm road and other is the Hearse Road. The Hearse Road is a nightmare at the moment, never mind when we double the population. I am all about social infrastructure. That covers a lot of areas but it is mostly about transport infrastructure. In the Minister's response to Senator Horkan, perhaps he could also touch on those issues."

The strategic rail review did look at this issue, especially the capacity constraints on the M1 coming from north to south. While it is a longer-term recommendation, it recommended an interurban rail spur going through the airport and further south into the city. It also looked at exactly what the Cathaoirleach was describing, that connection from the commuter line across. I remember thinking about extending it from Lissenhall to Donabate. That is not in the existing planning application so it will not form part of the first phase but, by whatever mechanism it is done, the strategic rail review has made a recommendation based on modelling that backs up what the Cathaoirleach is saying. That is for the longer term. It is going to take some time. We have to build the metro.",
                "I keep coming back to the point that Dublin is going to develop along the public transport routes we are investing in because there are no road plans for Dublin. There are none that would work so it has to be public transport. There is no road capacity that could be provided that would in any way address Dublin's transport issues. Because these projects and the land use plans connected to them are now so advanced, it will happen. The national planning framework is quite strong and clear on that. Even if you are building in the surrounding counties, you have to build on the rail lines rather than on the roads because, if you build on the roads, it will not work. You are coming to the M50, which is going to be gridlocked, and, when you get inside the M50, you are in a city that is bus-led with BusConnects corridors, so it just does not work to develop outwards on a car-based model. It cannot happen and will not work. The national planning framework agreed by Government yesterday doubles down on, copper-fastens and agrees with that.",

If you treat the committees seriously, get engaged and involved, and listen as well as question, you learn a lot. That learning then benefits your constituents because you can make informed decisions as parliamentarians or as Ministers. Even the character of these rooms add to it and lend to it. Sometimes they can be star chambers and we need that too. It is the learning in these chambers in the 20 years I have been here, or 16 years on and off, that is one of the things I have appreciated most."

We are here to discuss Scoil Aonghusa in Cashel. It is a fantastic school of 150 students with complex special needs. In 2015, school management reached out to the Department concerning the capacity required to meet the growing population of children with special needs. The school purchased 5 acres like it was told to do to provide for the necessary expansion. Twelve modular classrooms were required at that point, but the Department, in its wisdom, stated that the school would get five precast classrooms. There has been a development in this regard, but I will revert to that later.",

Approval was given in March 2023, but the completion date was quickly thrown out to September, which was when the expansion would be needed. In its wisdom, the Department gave the school second-hand Portakabins costing €1.4 million from a school in Dublin and landed them in the middle of the school’s car park the week school was returning. We all know the disruption that can be caused when that happens.",

The school and we want to know the commencement date and to be given a guarantee that it will happen. The more this drags on, the more it upsets everyone. The school has used the GP hall, a sensory room, the canteen and a hallway as classrooms because of heel dragging by the Department and, especially, the Minister over the past number of years. That needs to stop and the school needs clarity before we leave the Chamber today."

It is also a key priority for the Department and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE. The vast majority of children with special educational needs are supported to attend mainstream classes with their peers. Where children with more complex needs require additional supports, special classes and special school places are provided. For 2024, €2.7 billion is being spent on special education, an increase of €113 million, and this is dedicated to providing supports for children with special educational needs. This will allow for, among other things, the opening of up to 400 new special classes in mainstream schools and 300 additional special school places. This level of educational funding and support is unprecedented and represents in excess of 27% of the Department of Education’s total allocation for 2023.",

Those 350 projects involve a total State investment of more than €1.5 billion. The Department announced earlier this year that close to 90 projects, including 28 new school buildings, would be authorised to proceed from tender stage to construction over the course of 2024 and early 2025. In total, approximately €800 million will be invested in these projects under the Department’s large-scale capital programme and additional accommodation scheme for essential classroom accommodation. Between projects currently under construction and projects moving to construction in this latest phase, investments by the Department of Education are adding more than 550,000 sq. m of new and modernised capacity to our school estate. This is a record level of investment in school buildings and will expand the number of school places, significantly increase provision for special education and upgrade and modernise our school infrastructure. The impact of this will be felt in communities right around the country.",

In February 2023 the Department of Education changed it and listed five modular classrooms, citing a planning issue. In March 2023, approval was received for five modular classrooms to be ready for September 2023. Where are we now, in the dying days of this Government and, indeed, 2024? In June 2023 there was confirmation that these modular classrooms would not be on site by September 2023. I understand the school has not received any engagement to date as to when the modular classrooms are going to be built. It is scandalous. I thought the Minister of State was going to have answers today. I protested yesterday when the Minister was not coming and we were told the Minister of State would have the answers. He has no answers. The Department is assessing it. How can the Department and the Minister stand over this? Special children, daoine óga speisialta, have been treated like this. We actually need a new special needs school in Clonmel, our capital town, for the special children in south Tipperary, but that is not for today. Today it is about Cashel. Scoil Aonghusa, Ms Keyes Ryan and her excellent team, both teachers and carers, need to be supported. Above all they need certainty, not to be looking into a black hole of moving paper, assessments and more assessments."

In terms of delay, the latest response we have received indicates that this project will go to tender in quarter 4 of 2024. This is frustrating for the school community because there has been delay on that. There were indications last year that the project would go to tender early in 2024, then in mid-2024, then in quarter 3 and now quarter 4 of 2024. As the Minister of State might appreciate, there is concern that this slippage will continue. The school community wants some assurance that it will in fact go to tender in quarter 4.

There was supposed to be temporary accommodation provided in the meantime to meet the expanding school community for this school year. Incredibly, despite me and others raising this issue and the local school community sitting on this issue and chasing the Department and responsible authorities, the temporary accommodation was not in place for the start of the school year. It means one of the classes has to be accommodated in the GAA hall. In fairness to them, I want to read a letter that some of the third class pupils sent to local representatives. It is appropriate for the Minister of State to hear it as well. It was sent in September and these children are still not accommodated in their temporary accommodation:",

This area is a shared space so we cannot leave our belongings in it, we cannot keep our library books, toys or electronics in the space. It is also inconvenient for our families when they are collecting us and our siblings. We would like to request a classroom on Dunshaughlin Community National School ground as soon as possible.

These 350 projects currently in construction involve a total State investment of more than €1.5 billion. The Department announced earlier this year that close to 90 projects, including 28 new school buildings, would be authorised to proceed from tender stage to construction over the course of 2024 and early 2025. In total, around €800 million will be invested in these projects under the Department's large-scale capital programme and additional accommodation scheme for essential classroom accommodation. This is a record level of investment in school buildings. It will expand the number of school places, will significantly increase provision for special education and will upgrade and modernise school infrastructure. The impact of this will be felt in communities right around the country. I can assure the Deputy that the Dunshaughlin school campus project is a continuing priority for the Department.

                    "I wish to raise with the Minister of State the issue of public transport in Wicklow. It is one of the main issues people talk to me about. Constituents are being absolutely let down and failed by the Government's approach when it comes to the delivery of public transport. We could see no better or clearer example of that than the absolute chaos on the N11 every single morning. It is worse than it was before Covid-19. There are no longer any peaks on the N11. It is constantly one peak. It is always busy no matter what time one goes onto it.",
                    "However, it is not just the N11 where we can see the impacts of failure within Government policy when it comes to public transport provision. It is near impossible to get around Bray, Wicklow town, Greystones, Blessington and every single town at the moment with the level of cars trying to move around them. That is all because we do not have sufficient public transport.",
                    "The people in those cars who are making those 1 km journeys around their various towns in the county or those who are stuck on the N11 trying to get into work want to get public transport. The problem is that the public transport is either not there for them or it is not reliable. We have a situation in Wicklow, and it is seen across many parts of the country, where buses that are meant to show up do not show up, or when buses do show up, they are too full and drive past people who are waiting at stops. If people cannot guarantee that they are going to be able to get their bus and get into work, they are not going to be able to rely on it. People cannot continually go into their workplace and say, \"I am sorry, but my bus did not show up.\" People need a reliable and regular service.",
                    "The people in Wicklow are not looking for the sun, moon and stars when it comes to public transport. They are looking for very basic public transport provision. They are looking for buses that show up and that will bring them directly to hospitals, such as the 145. There is no direct link now to St. Vincent's hospital from Bray. People are looking for buses that will pick up. We have a situation where a bus will do a drop in Blessington but will not pick people up. The exact same bus on its return journey will not pick people up at the same spot because of some contractual issue the National Transport Authority, NTA, has overseen. It is crazy kind of stuff. There are always problems with the 133 in Newtownmountkennedy. Despite it being raised by multiple people, we are not seeing solutions being put in place. In Greystones, the buses will leave the train station before the DART has arrived. People get the DART and come out of the station to see the bus heading off into the horizon because it has not waited for them. This is basic stuff. Extra carriages are needed on trains. The train coming from Wicklow to Greystones and into Dublin has three carriages when it is absolutely full to the brim every single morning. There is not a single bus link between Wicklow town and Greystones, which has the DART station in it. These are two big towns on the east coast and there is not a single bus link between them. What we are looking for is the Government to provide the absolute basic and then, hopefully, expand to a transformative solution when it comes to public transport. It has to get the basics right, however, and unfortunately, people in Wicklow are not seeing that."

                    "Improving public transport services and infrastructure is central to improving citizens’ quality of life and addressing our climate action challenge, and this Government is committed to a fundamental change in the nature of transport in Ireland. The National Transport Authority has statutory responsibility for transport planning in the greater Dublin area, GDA, including County Wicklow. The NTA's greater Dublin area transport strategy, which was approved by the Minister for Transport in January 2023, sets out a framework for transport investment across the region over a 20-year period from 2022 to 2042, and it provides a clear statement of transport planning policy for counties Meath, Dublin, Louth, Kildare and Wicklow.",
                    "I consider it useful to clarify the planned proposals related to the DART+ Coastal South project and the current position of the proposals and related issues. Modelling undertaken by the NTA for the DART+ programme related to facilitating increased rail services on the Rosslare to Dublin line. This includes an option that would allow Rosslare train services to interchange with the DART at Wicklow or Greystones to connect seamlessly to DART services to or from the heart of Dublin. It must be stressed that this is an infrastructural modelling exercise, and the NTA has advised that no decision has yet been made to alter services on the Rosslare line.",
                    "As a Government, we need to provide more options to people in order that they can make the switch to sustainable mobility and within the greater Dublin area, work on the DART+ programme is continuing so it can become part of those options. It is also intended under the GDA transport strategy to further expand the DART to Wicklow town. Extending the DART to Wicklow is also supported in the all-island strategic rail review, which was published in July this year. Design work is ongoing at present by the NTA on the DART+ Coastal South project to plan for the enhanced DART service level from Dublin to Greystones, and a public consultation will be undertaken with regard to those proposals shortly.",
                    "In addition, initial planning-design work is currently ongoing by the NTA to establish the feasibility of operating an hourly DART service to and from Wicklow town and Dublin using battery-electric trains that could operate along an unelectrified section of the railway between Greystones and Wicklow. Under this arrangement, one DART per hour arriving at Greystones would be a battery-electric train, which would be able to continue further south along the unelectrified line and terminate at Wicklow town train station, with the same approach in the opposite direction.",
                    "Beyond DART services, Bray will be served by BusConnects bus services in the near future. Phase 6a of the network redesign will roll out in early December with the new 24-hour E spine connecting Bray with the city centre and the local L routes connecting Bray and its environs. In addition to the new services, the NTA has submitted a planning application for the Bray to city centre core bus corridor to An Bord Pleanála.",
                    "An Bord Pleanála has not yet made a decision on this application. In terms of light rail, a Luas line to Bray is one of the four Luas extensions identified in the Greater Dublin Area Transport Strategy 2022-2042 and the development of the Luas line from Bray to the city centre is part of the strategy's medium-term proposals for development and delivery in the period 2031 to 2036."

With regard to the extension of the DART to Wicklow town, the NTA has been very clear that will be five or six years down the road assuming everything goes well, that funding is provided to it and planning permission is received for it. These are all long-term projects. I welcome them and know it takes time to get them in place but what are people in Wicklow meant to do in the meantime? Due to the capacity and issues we see in public transport in Wicklow, people in Wicklow will not be able to wait for five, six or ten years for this or the next Government to get this right.",

Put Local Link buses in, small buses that go around our towns and that pick people up from their homes and their estates. Ease that traffic that is clogging up our main streets. Put extra carriages on. Why we do not have trains with a sufficient number of carriages in Wicklow is just beyond me.",
                    "The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, a Green Party TD, is the Minister for the environment and Minister for Transport, and the fact the public transport system in Wicklow is so poor is a really big reflection on his capacity to be able to deliver. This is not rocket science. All we are looking for are buses that actually perform the service they are meant to perform. We will be handing out €8 billion in fines to Europe in 2030 if we do not meet our emissions target and transport is the one area in which our emissions are continually going up. Rather than paying a cheque for €8 billion to Europe where we will see no advantage from it I ask that the Minister and whoever is in government next invest heavily in public transport infrastructure to assist and invest in our communities and to assist people in getting buses and trains to work, school or downtown when they need to go shopping."

It is also the final opportunity for the Government parties to make this commitment to carers. For our part in Sinn Féin, we are making this commitment to abolish the means test for carer's allowance. There is a reason this issue keeps returning to the agenda. It is because carers deserve respect and recognition but they also deserve support. We all know these people. We all know carers in our communities. We all know the sacrifices they make. We know how devoted they are. We know they are not doing it for money or payments. They are doing it out of love, responsibility, compassion and decency. We also know that if, somehow, all these carers decided to stop in the morning everything would grind to a halt. They save the State billions upon billions of euro every year. According to Family Carers Ireland, in 2022 family carers saved the State €20 billion.",
                "The State simply cannot afford to do without their care, yet we have countless carers who are putting in the hours and providing the care, but are getting little or nothing from the State because of the means test. The means test is exacting and demanding of carers who are already under severe pressure. These are people, lest it be forgotten, who already meet the other conditions of the scheme, which are not small. They must provide full-time care. The Minister of State's Department has set down that they must work for 35 hours a week, for five to seven days. They cannot work any other job for over 18.5 hours. For all that, they might get practically nothing.",
                "These carers are putting in the hours and providing the care, but because their partner is working, they may see much-reduced payments or indeed none at all. This is effectively a full-time job and often the only source of income for carers. In an interview conducted by Family Carers Ireland, one carer commented that it is the only job people are means-tested to do, and asked whether a nurse looking after somebody would be told by the Government that it will means test them? Another said they have a child who needs 24-7 care and they are working hard but because their husband is earning more than €800 or €900 a week, they do not get carer's allowance. It is so wrong.",

Thart timpeall an domhain, feicimid go bhfuil níos mó plé ar na costais atá i gceist le tithe altranais agus tithe cúraim do dhaoine a bhfuil gá acu le cúram. Tá an-ádh orainn sa tír seo go bhfuil líon na gcúramóirí teaghlach chomh láidir is atá ach ní féidir linn glacadh leis go leanfadh sé sin ar feadh i bhfad. Across so many countries, we have seen discussion of a crisis in social care. In the British election, it loomed large, as the cost of providing adequate nursing home care was debated. We are fortunate to have a strong network of family carers and people who care for their loved ones at home. In many instances, it is the preference of the carer and the person being cared for at home to be cared for at home but, too often, doing so is not sustainable, financially or otherwise. Abolishing the means test, while it will not solve every problem, will go a long way to providing the financial support for families to make caring at home possible. We should take every opportunity presented to us to protect care at home, and this one is crucial. We are also conscious that carers are often at risk of poverty, which is why it is crucial that the rates of payment to carers are increased over the term of Government.",
                "It is also the case that many people find themselves as carers very suddenly. For that reason, we have proposed introducing a pay-related carer's benefit scheme in this motion to avoid the cliff edge as people manage the transition to being a carer. As I said, this is not only the right thing to do but the strategically wise thing to do. It is the Government's final opportunity to commit to this. We know this will not be done overnight but we are asking the Government to make that commitment to carers and to agree that this should be the destination. If the Government is not going to oppose this motion, it needs to make it explicitly clear that it will make a roadmap to ensuring that the carer's means test is abolished. Carers need respect and recognition but what they really need is support. It is not the case that we cannot afford to do this. We cannot afford not to do this."

It laid out its asks of political parties going into this general election and what it wants to see included in every party's manifesto. At the top of that list was the abolition of the carer's allowance means test. It was going on what carers themselves were asking for. The room was full of carers and many carers joined us online too because they are not in a position to leave their homes and come to an event such as that. The feeling in that room was one of anger and of being ignored and taken for granted, and their needs not being met. As Deputy Ó Laoghaire said, it is reckoned that family carers save the State billions of euro every year. If one asks any family carer, they do not do what they do because of what money they might receive, but out of love and responsibility for the person they care for. They would not change it for the world but they need supports, which they are not getting at the moment.",
                "People yesterday talked about the amount of care that they provide, around the clock in some cases. Parents talked about children with complex disabilities who may need to be turned over or seen to during the night. Others talked about their autistic children who do not sleep for more than two or three hours at a time. When the children are up, they are up, because they have to ensure the safety of their child. Another carer who is caring for her parents talked about how she gets so little sleep because her father has dementia. He does not realise what time of day or night it is and he may be up during the night as well, which means she is up to ensure that he is safe. Many of the carers in the room yesterday were providing care for over 30 years. I know of carers in my constituency who have been providing for even longer than that. Their main worry is what will happen to their loved ones when they pass and it is really upsetting for them. I was speaking to a carer in my constituency yesterday evening. She is a carer for her two sons. Her mother has also developed dementia. As that progresses, she knows she will be a carer for her mother too. She was in receipt of the carer's allowance, which is being reviewed because of her husband's wages. She has been cut off at the moment because she did not get the information that she requires. She is addressing that but she realises that it will be cut or maybe cut off completely. She is so disappointed because she is not in a position to go out and work and earn money. Her loved ones, her two sons and her mother in time, will require the care that she will provide, yet because her husband's earnings are over a certain threshold, she will be penalised.",
                "Many carers talked yesterday about their treatment at the Intreo office or at the hands of staff of the Department of Social Protection. This is not to say that all of them are the same but some of them do not treat people with empathy. They tell stories where they are just left feeling worthless and are hauled over the coals about how many hours they worked in the week and whether they worked slightly over their 18.5 hours. We really need to trust that carers will provide proper care to loved ones and, if they are in a position to do a few hours of work outside the home or to undertake a training or educational course, that they will ensure they still provide the care that is required to their loved ones. I do not know about this restriction to 18.5 hours. It precludes them from taking part in a community employment scheme, for example, which would provide an outlet for many.",
                "Sinn Féin has given a commitment to remove the carer's allowance means test in the course of one term of government. In our alternative budget this year, we would raise the threshold to €1,460 for a couple and €730 per week for a single person, which was far beyond what the Government was prepared to do. I think the Government only committed something like €11 million in additional funding to the carer's allowance scheme, where we would have committed €100 million. We would have made those changes from January. I cannot understand this delay in passing on the increases until July. That is not fair. The issue of being left to wait for seven months is not happening to any other sector. Many carers talked about the devastation of the lack of supports. Home care is a huge issue. Carers, especially where there are complex disabilities within the home, require people to come in to help them, perhaps to change the person or where a hoist is required, and they are regularly left high and dry, without that vital support. This is creating another pressure on them."

He said another thing, which is so common for all our family carers, \"We love them to bits.\" He had to retire early from his job but told us even though he loved his job, he loved his girls more. He and his wife could not access the carer's allowance and, as he also said, his wife had to give up work. She had to give up a career that she loved and forfeit a salary and future pension entitlements. They could not access the carer's allowance. They also said, and this is an important point for our older carers in particular, \"Our futures are bleak enough as it is, getting older and frailer and still minding our adult children when we are getting to a stage when we ourselves are beginning to need help.\" It is important that we remember that perspective of older people, as they get older and are still looking after their children. Two other family carers spoke on that day. One has a child with a life-limiting condition. That carer was awarded a carer's allowance of €12 a week but was then told it would need to be reviewed and if it were paid incorrectly, it would have to be paid back.",
                "Many family carers are caring for loved ones because they love them. It is a tough job. In some cases, it is 24-7. They are not receiving any income support from the State. That is wrong. There is now an opportunity to signal to family carers in this State that if they care for their loved one, the State will financially support them. They deserve nothing less."

                "As previous speakers said, these jobs are done out of love and necessity. It is 24-7. Last year or the year before, I raised a Topical Issue regarding a mother who had cared for a child for more than 26 years but had never received as much as one cent for caring for that child. She walked the child when she had a broken hip. She cycled a bike with one leg because the child had to be walked twice a day. The problem was the means test. As she was in what could be called a convenience marriage, or a marriage on paper, but it was not matrimony in the house, and her partner was earning so much, the mother of the child was told for 20-odd years that she was not entitled to carer's allowance. When I raised her case in the House, I was told that people can look into situations on a case-by-case basis. We did not know that until we raised it. How many more people are in the same situation as this lady was? I met that mother when it was sorted. She thanked me and said it was the first time in her life that she had a bank account. This is what it is about. It is about real-life people.",
                "We have all heard terrible stories. I get emotional every time. I remember one little child who was on a beanbag because the carer did not have an appropriate chair for the child who was on oxygen 24-7. The mother had to give up her teaching job. She was crying beside her child because she was worried she could not even pay the ESB bill to keep the oxygen going. This is what is so important about getting these people the support. You cannot put a price on it. We all know carers are saving the country millions, but it is not always about money. It is about respect and giving people dignity. Those who are affected and need that care should have the best care, which should never be based on their means but on their needs. I hope the Government will support the motion."

I will raise a particular case, where carers and parents are raising concerns about a development in County Meath. The special care unit at Johnstown looks after children with profound physical and intellectual disabilities. A proposal has been made to move the children in question to a new special school unit at St. Mary's Special School. Currently, nine children have the care of three nurses and eight care staff. It is proposed, when they go to St. Mary's Special School, that they will have one teacher, two SNAs and one nurse, and the care staff will not come with them. I have raised this with the Department of Education, the Minister for Education, the HSE and the Minister for Health, but there is no movement on it. Real concerns are being raised by carers regarding this. I encourage the Minister of State to look at it because ultimately nobody knows the care needs better than those delivering the care on a 24-7 basis. It is about trust and the recognition of the value of the work people do. They do such incredible work, not just for the people they care for but the whole community and the country."

People come to me who have somebody with profound disabilities and have had serious problems for many years. They may get some home help from the HSE but when they look for additional home help, they are told they will have to hire that privately. When they look for it, it simply is not there because the staff are not there to do it. It is not as if there is another option for these people other than to do the caring themselves, in the vast majority of cases. The means test means that in the case of a couple who have a child with profound disabilities, one of them has to stay at home to look after the child. The other one cannot choose not to work. They have to pay their mortgage, pay their way and get on in life. What do they do? It is simply debilitating for them.",

It is about the provision of care for people in our society who need that care as an absolute necessity in their lives. That is what missing in all of this. The idea of the Government kicking it down the road until next summer is totally inappropriate. That needs to be reconsidered immediately. Sinn Féin has given a clear commitment that we would remove the means test from the carer's allowance immediately, if we were in government. This Government should do the same as we are on the edge of a general election.",

During the review, the official asked him how much time he spends on the land doing the farming. He said about two and a half or three hours a day. His carer's allowance was taken away. Three hours a day by seven days a week is 21 hours and his allowance was gone. The man was just making an off-the-cuff remark. He did not measure the time he spends looking after the farm, yet his carer's allowance was taken away. Those kind of hard, difficult decisions that these people make, which absolutely destroy people's lives, need to be reconsidered. The way they should be reconsidered is by the Government recognising that carers are people who need to get support. It is not just about getting support but getting respect. It is about having respect for people with disabilities who need the care as well as, usually, their very close family members who provide the care for them out of a sense of love, kinship and understanding that these people have no other option. There is nobody else there to care for them, yet the Government continues to abandon them."

                "On a personal level, I know that the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, has always sought to make sure the interests of carers are front and centre of budget decisions.",
                "This approach has been evidenced again in the most recent budget with an extensive package of measures announced for family carers. This includes once-off lump sum and double payments to assist carers and those they care for, such as the following: the October cost-of-living bonus, which was paid to carers last week; a €400 cost-of-living lump-sum payment for carers eligible for the carer’s support grant, which will be paid next week; and a Christmas bonus, which will be paid to over 1.3 million long-term welfare recipients, including carers. As part of budget 2025, the Government has extended the carer’s benefit scheme to the self-employed for the first time. The Government has also increased the carer’s support grant twice during its term and it now stands at €2,000 a year, its highest ever rate.",
                "Significantly, the Government has delivered on the programme for Government commitment to provide a pension solution for long-term carers. This important reform enables long-term carers who have been caring for an incapacitated dependant for 20 years or more to qualify for the contributory State pension. Under the scheme, for the first time, full-time carers can get long-term carer's contributions to cover gaps in their contribution record, which can help them qualify for a pension. Since January 2024, long-term carer's contributions can be awarded to a person who has cared for an incapacitated person for a period of 20 years or more. These contributions are treated the same as paid contributions for the contributory State pension entitlement only, and can be used to fill any gaps in a person's contribution record, including satisfying the minimum 520 paid contributions required for eligibility.",
                "Long-term carer's contributions have been available to individuals who reached State pension age from 1 January 2024 and are also available to those already aged 66 or over prior to that date. In the case of those already over the age of 66, care periods provided for incapacitated dependants up to their 66th birthday are assessed for entitlement to long-term carer's contributions. Such a person can apply for long-term carer's contributions and receive a contributory State pension or an enhanced rate of pension if already in receipt of less than the maximum rate from 1 January 2024, where eligible. As a result, at the end of September, 580 people were awarded the contributory State pension, with a further 199 people receiving an increase in the rate paid.",
                "The main income supports provided by the Department of Social Protection include carer's allowance, carer's benefit, domiciliary care allowance and the carer's support grant. Spending on these payments in 2024 is expected to be in the region of €1.7 billion. Carer’s allowance is the main scheme by which the Department provides income support to carers in the community and some 97,393 people are currently supported by this payment. This year, the expenditure on the carer’s allowance scheme is estimated to be over €1.1 billion. As the Deputies are aware, carer’s allowance is a means-tested social assistance payment awarded to those who are caring for people who need full-time care and attention. A means test is a way of targeting limited resources at those who have the lowest incomes. Means tests are used not just for carer payments but for pensioners, disabled people, lone parents and jobseekers. It is a system that applies across the board, based on supporting households with the lowest means.",
                "In the case of the carer’s allowance payment, as has been made clear on previous occasions, the payment is not and was never intended to be a payment for the provision of care. The Minister for Social Protection has made significant improvements to capital and income disregards for carers that allow many more carers to qualify for carer’s allowance. The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, was the first Minister in 14 years to increase the disregard for carer’s allowance. The capital and savings disregard for the means assessment was increased from €20,000 to €50,000, which equates to €100,000 for carers who are part of a couple. Since 2021, under this Government, the carer’s allowance income disregards have been increased from €332.50 to €625 for a single person, and from €665 to €1,250 for carers with a partner. The disregards for carer’s allowance are now by far the highest income disregards of any weekly payment in the social welfare system. In the case of a couple, a carer will be able to retain a full-rate payment of €260 per week while having an annual income of just over €69,000 from employment, or retain a half-rate payment of €130 per week while having an annual income from employment of nearly €84,000.",
                "The Minister has established an interdepartmental working group, with the Department of Health and the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, to examine and review the system of means tests for carer payments. This group is expected to report on its findings in quarter 4 of this year. The outcome of this work and other work in the Department around means testing generally will help to inform any future decisions regarding changes to social welfare payments, including carer’s allowance.",
                "In addition to significant improvements to the means test for carer’s allowance already outlined, over the last four budgets, the weekly carers' payments, that is, carer’s allowance and carer’s benefit, have increased by €41 per week. As part of budget 2025, the rate of carer’s allowance will increase by €12 to €260 per week for a carer aged under 66 years caring for one person. It is important to put this into context, given the equivalent payment to a carer across the Border in Northern Ireland is currently almost €97 per week. It is also important to point out that the carer’s allowance payment in Northern Ireland is subject to an income limit of approximately €179.95 per week, much lower than our income disregard.",
                "The programme for Government and the economic recovery plan included commitments to consider a pay-related jobseeker's benefit scheme. The Minister for Social Protection recently signed the commencement order confirming that the new jobseeker's pay-related benefit scheme will be available from 31 March 2025. The priority is to launch this scheme and the Government has been clear that this experience should be used to inform future decisions regarding pay-related schemes. As part of the consultation process, the Department of Social Protection sought feedback on applying a pay-related approach in respect of other short-term income supports, for example, parental leave benefits, maternity benefit and illness benefit. It should be noted that the issue of pay-related carer’s benefit was not raised to any significant degree in the consultation. However, I think the same approach applies and we should look at the experience of the jobseeker scheme to inform where we go next.",
                "It is also important to note that the jobseeker’s pay-related benefit approach is being introduced on the basis of increased PRSI rates, as agreed in the programme for Government, because it needs to be funded from the Social Insurance Fund. This is necessary to ensure the sustainability of the fund, including the retention of the pension age at 66 years, as agreed by the Government. Accordingly, it follows that the continued expansion of a pay-related benefit framework to other schemes, such as carer’s benefit, will need detailed analysis, including any potential impact on PRSI rates.",
                "As I said, we are not opposing this motion because it is a debate worth having. I think all of us in the House recognise the valuable contribution that family carers make to our society and we all want to further enhance the supports available to them and, equally as important, the supports available to those they care for. The Government has done a lot to improve carers' payments during its time. While we recognise that more needs to be done, we need to make sure that whatever we do is affordable and sustainable into the future. I again thank the Deputies for raising the matter and I look forward to hearing the various contributions."

Instead of increasing the income disregard for carer’s allowance, the Government should scrap the means test completely. That is the solution. The money is there to do it.

The issues around social care and the lack of supply are not going away. The State will experience a growing need for the provision of care, which is why investing in carers is crucial at this stage. The State cannot take our carers for granted any longer.

The first is the case of a woman, and this is not the first time I have brought it up here. She is a carer in her home. She also works for a home care company and tries to do so within the 18.5 hours per week limit. Like everyone else, she has to deal with other realities of life. The nature of the work with her current client means she sometimes has to exceed the time she is allotted. She works up to 20 hours and when this happens, the carer's allowance section reviews the case. When it receives her payslips it is found that she has worked more than 18.5 hours and she has to pay back the full amount for the week. This is no way to be operating in the modern age. The Government is penalising people who are doing huge work on behalf of society.",
                "Another lady who works for a dementia charity was asked by her boss to fill in for someone who was off sick. She did this necessary work for a considerable period. She faced the same scenario but for a longer period and she now has to pay back €28,000. There will be huge numbers of similar cases. I hope that whatever happens and whoever is in government, I do not find myself repeating the same story again."

Carers are fed up with the Government paying lip service to what they do and with how valuable they are portrayed in society. The facts are that many carers find themselves having to give up their jobs, take a substantial hit in their household finances and often having to take on a round-the-clock, dedicated carer's role.",

Immediately, it would increase household income and add to the betterment and improvement of conditions for the persons they love and care for. Immediately, it would give a real and tangible lift to carers who deserve far more than the punitive means-test system that leaves them worse off at a time when they need the most help.",
                "It is simple. All the Minister of State has to do is go out and ask carers about the difficulties they face on a daily basis. Each household faces different hardships and modes of care. Carers deal with all sorts of disabilities. The Government had an opportunity to do away with the means test in its auction budget for 2025, yet it has not committed to do so. Meanwhile, once again, carers are put on the lower shelf and must wait until January for an increase in the threshold.",
                "In this motion, we are also asking that the Government put in place a pay-related carer's benefit scheme. This is important as in many cases, family members or individuals become carers overnight due to sudden accidents, diagnoses or strokes, which have an immediate and life-changing effect on their personal and family households.",

The Government allocated €11 million to relax the means test for carers next year. Sinn Féin, in its alternative budget, allocated €100 million. That is the difference a Sinn Féin government would make. Carers' incomes fall far short of the established minimum standard of living income, despite saving the Government millions in health bills. We ask all TDs to support this motion and support our carers."

The Labour Party believes in a society that values care and invests in it from cradle to grave, so that people have access to the services they need when they need them. In our election manifesto, we will outline our proposals for a new social care contract to support family carers and care workers.",
                "For many years, the Labour Party has campaigned for family carers and care workers, with motions passing in the Dáil and Seanad in 2023. Unfortunately, Government parties have ignored these proposals despite the transformational potential we had in budget 2025. Real change will be needed in the next five years. The next Government will have an awful lot of money in the coffers but will it have the ambition to change those areas that need true transformation, including the role of carers and care workers?",
                "The Labour Party will consider the future recommendations of the commission on care. In the meantime, we will establish a national planning unit for care to oversee all aspects of care planning and implementation rooted fundamentally in the drive to deprivatise care services. A priority will be the mapping of existing services and infrastructure, demographic modelling of future demand and geographic and economic barriers to access.",
                "There are over 500,000 family carers in Ireland and their unpaid work saves the State over €20 billion a year. The 2022 census shows that the number of unpaid carers increased by 53% to over 299,000. That number has most likely breached the 300,000 mark since that census. The Labour Party has proposed long-needed policy changes to support family carers, such as removing the restrictive means test and the low rate of payment, which is not sufficient to meet the financial needs of those caring for dependants. We will carry out an evaluation of carer's allowance and other supports as part of a full cost-of-care review. Parents have consistently told us that the application and appeals process for the domiciliary care allowance is simply not fit for purpose, and the Labour Party will reform it. Labour would also increase the housing adaptation grant. Many of those receiving care are not living the quality of life they should, given increased building costs and the current restrictive amount of the grant.",
                "The Labour Party is committed to implementing the carer's guarantee and we have long supported the removal of the means test for carer's allowance. We will phase out the carer's allowance income disregard as part of the development of the new family care payment, in line with the call made by Family Carers Ireland. We will progressively increase the half-rate carer's allowance in recognition of the value of care work and as part of a systemic change to a participation income. We will increase the number of hours per week a carer can work or study to provide for more flexibility.",
                "We will increase the carer's support grant up to €2,500 and ensure that all those in receipt of it are entitled to carer's allowance. We will implement a respite strategy to guarantee access for all family carers with a comprehensive system to map demand and the range of capacities available. We will reform the application and appeals process for domiciliary care allowance to make it fit for purpose and provide for much-needed payment increases. We will fully fund the carer's guarantee. We will ensure that kinship care and foster care are properly supported. Labour will replace the mobility allowance and motorised transport grant with the transport support scheme. We will also support family carers to enter or remain in employment or education. We will address anomalies with carer's benefit such as the €450 earnings limit. We will review the home care and dependent relative tax credits to address impacts on single people and those caring for a non-child relative.",
                "As someone who has dealt with hundreds of carers' applications over the past number of years, I am acutely aware of the current problem facing carers in this country. Too many carers are not getting the payment they deserve. Too many face unacceptable delays with applications and the trauma of having to have their applications reviewed and then appealed. Far too many of these reviews are simply not fair and put demands on carers that should not be there. Carers save this State €20 billion each year. Over the past four years I have witnessed through my own office, testimony from carers and those receiving care, advocacy groups like Family Carers Ireland and carers I meet on the doors and in my advice clinics. The €20 billion they save the State every year is an extraordinary amount when put into euro and cent. It is the kind of money that would build numerous hospitals, metro and Luas links, transport infrastructure and housing. This is what carers are doing every day. Yes, it is about being valued and getting the payments they deserve. It is also about respecting the work they do. While the system is not meeting the demands and needs of carers, it is fundamentally undervaluing the work they do for their loved ones, their families, their community and for the State. Despite its riches and despite the increase in some payments, the Government has missed an opportunity to truly reform the world of carers' payments and supports. It is something the next Government must do, and if Labour is part of that Government, we will."

                "I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important subject. It is not the first time we have spoken on it in the Regional Group of Independent TDs, of which I am a member with Deputy Verona Murphy. We have been advocating for a non-means-tested carer's allowance support grant for a long time. As a member of the disability matters committee, I have heard first-hand through listening to people with the experience of living in a household with somebody with a disability, the trauma and struggle that always prevails. When a man comes into my office who in effect is being penalised because he got married, because his wife's income is now being taken into account in terms of the means of the household when they look at carer's allowance, it is not right. You have situations where a young mother decides to give up her career after getting her third level education and maybe spending three or four years in the workforce. She sacrifices all of that and the potential there for her, to look after her child who has special needs. She is then requested to submit her husband's or partner's income as part of the process to decide the means test. That is absolutely wrong. There is no way around it. It is simply not right. The reason is that we all know, from the Indecon report, the additional cost for people living with a disability. This is not about the Ukraine war, or the cost of living. It is about the cost of living with a disability. The Indecon report suggests and confirms that the additional cost of living with that disability is somewhere between €9,000 and €12,000 per year. Yet, we have been advocating for additional transport services or transport service supports for people with disabilities, and it is not forthcoming.",
                "We have a primary medical certificate procedure process which is horrendous. You will now only be successful if you have lost a limb. It is incredible that we have brought it to a stage where people who really need to get their cars adapted are not getting that adaption done, because they are being refused. As Members are aware, the appeals board resigned over the fact it could not look at any appeal because the criteria were so tight. It was black and white. You had to have lost a limb. That is still going on. It has been under review but the motorised transport supports, which were there, were withdrawn. We now have a situation in this State where people are rightly getting paid money for the fact that they have a disability, to help them with the additional costs of getting around and for their independence. We have other people who get nothing because they were born after a certain date. That is discrimination and inequality.",
                "In his report on disabilities before he stepped down as the Ombudsman, Peter Tyndall stated it was absolutely alarming and needed to be dealt with as a matter of urgency. The Government has failed to deal with that. It now has an opportunity with the non-means-tested carer's allowance to put that in place. I acknowledge there are issues with it, and the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, has said there are some issues and she would work to make it happen over the coming number of years. The commitment has got to be there. We have to see it in the parties' manifestoes and we have to see the implementation of that shortly after the new Government is formed. We are treating people wrongly. We are treating carers with disrespect. They are saving the State €20 billion per annum. The cost of a non-means-tested carer's allowance would be something like €175 million. That is not my figure. That is from research conducted by Maynooth college on behalf of Family Carers Ireland. We know what happened with the referendum when people tried to disrupt family caring. People will not have it, but they will support anybody who will support the idea of a non-means-tested carer's allowance."

                "This is my forty-ninth speech on carers. While I welcome that Sinn Féin has a brought a motion, I am disappointed that it did not come on board as an Opposition party much earlier to look for the abolition of the carer’s means test. While it always maintains there should be a more streamlined approach and a little incremental increase in that, it did not look for abolition. My colleague Sean Canney and I, and our other colleagues in the Regional Group, brought forward two motions for abolition. They were two motions that the Government also accepted. The reason it accepted them is because it was not going to do anything about it. Here we are, maybe 24 hours out from an election, and the Government is again accepting this motion because it knows it will not do anything about it. The reality is that the Minister of State has made a speech that the Government is supporting 97,000 carers. I tell the Minister of State that it is not supporting another 200,000. According to the last census there were almost 300,000 carers in this country, and we know that has increased since the last census. My colleagues spoke about how we treat carers. We do not treat carers, we mistreat them. We are carrying out a means test that is, as has been said 100 times, mean. We are assessing somebody else's income to penalise the person who is providing the care to assess whether or not they have enough money and do not need to be paid for the care they do. Of course they should be paid for the care they do. We do not means-test jobseeker's payments. At a time when we have full employment, we carry out reviews at a level of 12,000 per annum on carers looking after their elderly or their vulnerable children in their own homes, saving this State €20 billion, and we are reviewing them at a rate five times more than that of jobseekers. These are people who we say could have jobs if they went out and looked for them but yet we will not pay those who save the State €20 billion.",
                "As my colleague said, that is not a figure I made up. It is a figure that comes from proper PhD researchers in Maynooth University, paid for by Family Carers Ireland.",
                "It is incredible the Minister of State can sit there. I understand why he is not looking at me. I would not be able to look at me either if I had stood up 49 times here saying the same thing. People give up their jobs to save the State money and we carry out a test on the people with whom they may or may not have a relationship but who happen to reside in the same household. A little more than two thirds of them are women and one third are men. The reality, as everyone knows, is that if it were the other way around and two thirds were men, carers would be paid. There would not be any means test. It is as simple as that but because they are women who spend all their time doing what they do, they have little time to advocate for the abolition of the means test. I have advocated for it since I was elected for the simple reason that they appear at my door or I go to visit them in their homes where I see what they do 24-7.",
                "I have mentioned on this floor many times one carer who is the mother of four severely intellectually and physically disabled children. She is in receipt of 1.5 carer's allowances, perhaps €400 per week and she has no life. She says she provides physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, everything that would be provided if the State had to look after them and she probably provides a State saving of a little more than €1 million per year for carrying out that function. It is beyond me that as this Dáil comes to an end we are still standing here pleading with the Government. I recognise the inroads it has made. I just do not understand why we are penalising people who do a State service and save the taxpayer €20 billion.",

It is a job I was proud to do, but it is a hard job and it means that people are more or less on call 24-7. That puts carers into a special category that is not recognised and never has been by any Government. Never mind this one, it has never been recognised by any previous one and I doubt it will be even by the next one, except for this fact. The carers are getting organised. Family Carers Ireland has organised tens of thousands of them. They are becoming like a trade union, like a working group who are standing up and fighting for themselves. I commit myself when I am outside the Dáil doing real politics to helping them to build a movement that will pressurise any future government into listening to them and giving them what they rightly deserve.",
                "I find it ironic that in his speech when he announced the budget, the Minister for Finance made a statement in relation to carers that \"the Government is committed to supporting individuals and families with caring responsibilities.\" That is a strong statement, much stronger than the wording proposed in the care referendum, which was defeated because of the wording. That wording, in a weak and non-committal way, said that Governments would strive to support carers. The Minister's statement is more committed than the one given to us in the referendum. It is no wonder it was defeated as it failed to recognise the role hundreds of thousands of men, women and often children play in keeping this society going and the €20 billion per year, last estimated in 2022, they save the Irish State. Given that we now have a huge surplus with the Apple tax, the very least any government should do before going out of office is to abolish the mean-spirited and often personalised and intrusive assessment for the carer's allowance.",
                "The criteria are intrusive, often asking personal questions and, as was illustrated earlier, asking what people do with their daily time if they work more than 18 hours a week. For example, farmers might say they are working 21 hours on the farm and lose the carer's allowance for that reason. It is time we recognise the absolutely fundamental role carers play and will continue to play. We have to thank them, but thanking them is not enough. We also have to reward them. In our election manifesto, People Before Profit commits in the future to paying carers a living wage of €15 per hour. No other party recognises that in an average week carers work the many hours they do, but given an average working work, they should receive the living wage of €15 per hour, never mind the minimum wage. The abolition of the means test is crucial to treating them with the respect and recognition they deserve. Their lives are put on hold. I can say that from lived reality. I was a short-term carer but many do it for a whole lifetime. Recognition of that sacrifice is needed and driving them into poverty and treating them as objects is beyond the pale. We need to end that practice and I hope in the future the movement will force a future government to do so."

                "No words can pay enough tribute to the role carers play in society. Those carers can be elderly themselves, infirm and they can be young people, looking after their loved ones who are vulnerable and disabled people. If the State had to provide that care and those services, it would cost countless billions. However, this is done by people who, as a result of such things as the means test for carers, are effectively trapped in poverty. Many of those trapped in poverty are women. One of the disgraceful aspects of this is that it often makes women carers vulnerable where they are dependent on their male partners. I was shocked, as I have said before, when I met a carer on the street a number of months ago and she talked about a situation where her partner was holding back money for sanitary products. That is absolutely shocking. To put women, sometimes women who may be victims of domestic abuse, in that kind of vulnerable position where they are trapped and dependent on the income of a partner from whom they may be alienated or suffering abuse is shocking.",
                "The intrusiveness and inhumanity of the means test is sometimes equally shocking. This week, a woman in her 70s who cares for her disabled son who is in his 20s came into our office. She asked us to highlight the fact that although her income situation has not changed for 50 years and is hardly going to change when she is in her 70s, it is means-tested every two years. Such questions as how she could afford to go on holidays are asked. The only holiday she is able to take is because of the small grants she gets towards that for respite.",
                "It is absolutely unbelievable that somebody could be treated in that way, and subject to that kind of interrogation every two years when he or she is doing such a service, and when he or she has made such sacrifices for their loved ones.",
                "The means test for carers should go. We have said that for a very long time. The Government has badly let people down. It has clearly failed to listen to the lesson of the recent referendum, which to a substantial degree was about the demand to get rid of the means test for carers. Furthermore, People Before Profit not only want to get rid of the means test for carers, but as Deputy Bríd Smith said, they should be given a living income of at least €15 an hour. That would still be cheap at the price for the work they do for our society, for their loved ones and for vulnerable and disabled people.",
                "On a related issue, we believe the means test for disability allowance should also be scrapped, because that is also about trapping people with disabilities, often in poverty. That is the case, for example, if you go over the threshold of €50,000. Let us remember that a report published in recent years showed that people with disabilities have additional costs of €10,000 to €12,000 a year. There are very substantial costs. If you have assets of more than €50,000, it begins to impact on your disability allowance. If, for example, your parents die and leave you a few quid, you then start to have your disability allowance impacted upon. It is absolutely outrageous and traps people with disabilities in poverty. Not only should the means test for carers go, but the means test for disability allowance should also go as part of honouring all the rhetoric and the commitment to the UNCRPD, which is not in reality honoured in the sense of ensuring real equality and support for people with disabilities. I thank the Chair for his generosity in allowing us to have this speaking slot."

                "Most of us want to thank Sinn Féin for bringing forward this motion, which is a vitally important one that urges us to acknowledge the immense, often unseen, contribution carers make to our society. Such care is effectively a shadow health service. It is high time we addressed the appalling treatment they receive from a system that seems blind to their worth, one that has left too many of them out in the cold. As this is the last speaking slot for many of us, I hope, following this motion today, we can all agree this is something that certainly needs to change.",
                "Carers provide essential care and support to our loved ones, care that the State would otherwise be unable to offer at scale and with the same dedication. They care with dignity, selflessness and without expectation, yet they are continually excluded from fair financial support. There is no excuse for leaving these individuals to shoulder the heavy burden of caregiving alone. This motion calls on the Government to abolish the carer's allowance means test, one that is quite frankly outdated, inequitable and deeply unfair. It is also a test that excludes so many of those who need support the most. I can think of no logical reason to retain this test, which penalises people who are already asked to make so many sacrifices.",
                "We are all knocking on doors at the moment. Undoubtedly, like me, every single night each of us meets a carer. As the door opens, once they tell us what they do, the expectation is that they will go on to tell us how they are being failed by the State. Only last week I had such a conversation with a person on the doorstep. I will call her Mary, because I do not have permission to use her first name. Her story is a reminder of just how broken our system is. Mary has been caring for her son, who has profound disabilities, for the better part of 20 years. Every day is a struggle to ensure he has the dignity, love and care he deserves. She administers his medication and assists him with his basic needs. She advocates for him tirelessly. Mary's husband works full time and he earns an income that disqualifies her from receiving the carer's allowance yet, as anyone familiar with the reality of family life knows, it is nowhere near enough to cover all their expenses and to provide for a family with a child who requires round-the-clock care.",
                "Mary tells me that while her husband's income may look decent on paper, it is stretched thin by the cost of her son's care. Specialist appointments, adaptive equipment and transportation are not inexpensive. She often has to make the impossible choice between caring for her son's needs and her own health, well-being and most of the time her basic financial security. That is because an arbitrary means test judges a family's eligibility based on a single income and dismisses the complexity of their financial needs. We are forcing people like Mary into impossible situations and ignoring the real cost of caregiving, both financially and personally.",
                "This Government claims it values carers, yet it tells people like Mary and others whom we all meet every single night that their time and devotion simply do not count. The Government's reluctance to abolish the means test outright is just one of the many ways it fails to recognise caregiving as real, valuable work. We know the value of carers' contributions, not just emotionally but financially as well. The economic contribution of carers in Ireland is estimated at hundreds of millions of euro annually. These are individuals who are saving the State a fortune, yet the State turns its back on them. It is an injustice that I and my colleagues across the Chamber are committed to correcting. The policy position of the Social Democrats is that we have called not just for the abolition of the means test but for a comprehensive overhaul of the carer's allowance. Carers should not have to worry about thresholds, limits or eligibility criteria that do not recognise their unique and pressing needs.",
                "What we need is a universal, non-means-tested carer's income and support that respects the contribution of every carer in Ireland regardless of his or her household income. This is about more than just money. When carers are excluded from support, it takes a mental and emotional toll. These are people who give everything they have to care for their loved ones, who put their own health and well-being second. They do not receive a day off or even a moment to themselves. When we exclude them from support, we are effectively saying to them that their sacrifices are invisible; that they do not matter to the State.",
                "Carers deserve better than that. They deserve the respect and recognition they have been so long denied. They deserve respite, a chance to rest and time to care for themselves, even as they provide care to others. As it stands, the State does not offer carers a fair deal. There are those who spend decades providing care, only to find themselves excluded from a pension that recognises their contribution. Imagine spending 20 to 30 years looking after a loved one, only to reach old age with no financial security. That is the reality for too many carers, one we must seek to change.",
                "The Social Democrats, taking inspiration from groups such as Family Carers Ireland, have proposed a number of reforms that would make a meaningful difference. These include the establishment of a statutory right to home care, the benchmarking and indexing of carer's payments and the expansion of the free travel scheme to those receiving the domiciliary care allowance. These reforms are not luxuries, they are necessities.",
                "Let us also not overlook the critical role respite plays in sustaining the health and well-being of carers. Without regular and adequate respite, carers are at risk of burnout, physical injury and emotional strain. We meet them every single day. Every carer deserves the right to a life outside the caregiving role, to rest and to take time for him or herself without guilt or worry.",
                "While we are on the topic of reform, we must also ensure the community and voluntary sector, in particular section 39 organisations, which provide an invaluable service to carers and those they care for, receive the funding and support they need. The current disparity in pay and conditions for this sector creates a recruitment and retention crisis, leaving families like Mary's without access to essential services. Not having a fair and sustainable funding model leaves carers even more isolated.",
                "This motion is simply about respect. It is about saying to carers that we see them, we value them, and we are committed to supporting them. For too long, the State has treated caregiving as an afterthought, something less important than paid employment, but we know better. We know that caring for another human being is one of the most difficult, demanding and selfless jobs.",
                "As we part, I say to the Government that it is time to stop delaying and deflecting and to start delivering for carers. In the next government we must commit ourselves across the Chamber to abolishing the means test, establishing a fair non-means-tested carer's income support and to the creation of a system that honours the contribution of every carer in this country.",
                "To the carers across Ireland who are looking in today, as many did to the Family Carers Ireland event yesterday, we owe you a simple thanks for the work you do on behalf of this State, much of which is not recognised."

Carers were getting nothing out of that referendum. In fact, they were going to get less. I deplore they way they were abused. There were constant phone calls from the Fine Gael director of elections, Deputy Humphreys, to ask its members to do more and get out and canvass. The Government used and abused these people, as if they are not used and abused enough in the way they have to care for their families, with the removal of services like home help. Now we can get home helps ratified in a couple of days but the Government knows that there is nobody there to do the work. It is just ticking boxes. I condemn the patronising way carers are being treated. The way they were abused in that referendum was nothing short of scandalous.",

It is an awful indictment of our State in 2024, especially given all of the money that is going into the HSE. When I came in here it was €6.5 billion or €7 billion but now it is €26 billion, with another €1.5 billion over again. Those at the bottom of the chain suffer all of the time. They are not getting the supports because of the bureaucratic nature of the system. I want to salute the people who come in, the home helps and carers, for the sterling efforts they make. We do not support them enough. We should support them. I support this motion and compliment the movers of same. We should all do our bit. I never fail to wear the carer's badge. It is a nice badge. I like to wear it and try to support them in any way I can."

                "I thank Sinn Féin for bringing this very important motion before the Dáil. Carers are the unsung heroes of Ireland, providing essential care that supports both their loved ones and the broader healthcare system. The current means test for carer's allowance is a significant barrier that prevents many carers from receiving the support they need. Abolishing this means test would not only provide financial relief to carers but would also recognise their invaluable contribution to society and the economy. It is time for the Government to take decisive action and ensure that carers receive the respect, recognition and support they deserve. I say that based on my work in County Kerry. I am so proud and glad of the people I meet in my day-to-day work and the massive service that they give. Our nursing homes, community hospitals and bigger hospitals are creaking under pressure as it is. If the excellent work that carers are doing were to stop and if all the people who are being cared for at home were to be in the public system all of a sudden there would be total chaos. The best value for the money the State spends would be to give an adequate amount to people who might have been thrown off a cliff edge. They might have been getting on fine with their lives and then all of a sudden an event happens like a heart attack, a stroke or the beginning of Alzheimer's disease and they have to face caring for a person at home. It could be the victim of an accident or a person who is just getting older and slowing down. The best value we will ever get is to pay people to take care of others at home but we must do it adequately. The means test should be abolished.",

Even though we would be from different sides of the political fence, I never held Deputy Ring in anything but the highest esteem. I personally believe that his loss to Irish politics will be vast and great given his experience and ability to put effort into his constituency. Nobody could ever polish his shoes for the effort, drive, energy and determination that he put into his role as a public representative. It will be remembered forever. He is a legendary figure in Irish politics and I mean that - a legendary figure."

He had stage four cancer but there was no medication forwarded to the home. The home contacted the HSE in Cork but was told that it could not do anything for John because he was a Limerick man in a Cork nursing home.

They cannot have urgent operations for things like cataracts and hip or knee replacements. At the very end, they are fleeced under the fair deal scheme. The Government has literally left people unaided at a very vulnerable time in their lives and that is because they cannot shout the loudest. They cannot stand outside the Dáil and cry that they have not got a bed. The only beds being offered to people in west Cork are in another county. It is an outrageous situation that people find themselves in. Some are on medical wards and they cannot leave because there is no bed in a community hospital or a nursing home. They are absolutely at breaking point. Community hospitals should be expanding because our ageing population is growing. Instead of an expansion in the number of beds, community hospitals are staying the same. They are quite brilliant in their delivery but they still have the same 25 or 30 beds that they had 30 years ago, when the aged population was not the size it is now. There is something wrong.",

Surely to God if a new home help is coming on, they can go door to door with a home help who is already working. That should be their training. That would be common sense training and real training on the ground. The Minister of State must look at these areas because the Government is letting down the elderly people of this country.

                "The current means test and the limit on hours that carers are allowed to work are ridiculous. Why are we punishing people who are saving the State time and money? Why are we ignoring the fact that many carers are parents or family members of the person they care for? Why are we further condemning them to poverty? Carers already experience many burdens, financially and socially, in health and in quality of life. The means test prevents many people who are providing care from being compensated for their hard work.",
                "In Donegal, there are almost 10,700 unpaid carers, which is 6% of the population of the county. There are 139 carers under 15 years of age providing regular unpaid care in the county and 60% of all carers in Donegal are female, in line with the national figure. This shows that females are disproportionately affected by this Government's decision to keep the means test. Shamefully, the period between 2016 and 2022 saw some significant increases in the hours of unpaid care provided. The number of carers in Donegal providing 43 or more hours of unpaid help each week almost doubled, from 1,688 in 2016 to 3,324 in 2022. It is clear that this Government has made things worse for carers. They have done nothing to invest in support for our carers or to recognise their immense contribution to our society. Years of Government inaction and Governments that have prioritised profit, foreign investment and large corporations over our people have had a negative effect on every faction in our society, including our carers, teachers, childcare workers, disabled people, farmers and fishermen. The people will let it be known at the doors and at the polls that this country deserves better. It deserves a Government that is ready to make the system work for everyone, not just a select few."

                "This debate takes place in the context of many reports. In 2022, the Joint Committee on Gender Equality made the recommendation that a person should be assessed on their individual means. The National University of Ireland did a report for Family Carers Ireland which talked about income. Family Carers Ireland's pre-budget submission called for the full abolition of the means test. Separately, we had a cross-party committee on many issues. In respect of carers, the committee's report examined the impact of means testing on the carer's allowance. The organisations detailed a range of issues to the committee, including that the means test is burdensome and difficult to navigate, and deters people from getting employment and so on. We have had any amount of reports.",
                "In addition to those reports, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission appealed to the Government, among 40 recommendations, to place care within the human rights framework for care. The OECD has told us that the number of hours spent on unpaid care work, valued at an hourly minimum wage, which is the wage that most women get, would amount to 90% of the global GDP. That is the context.",
                "The number of people getting the carer's allowance, having jumped through all the hoops, is minimal. Just over 98,000 are getting the payment. An amount of people are getting no pay whatsoever. I thank the Library and Research Service, as always, for its briefing note in this regard and its history of this issue. It tells us that there are 300,000 unpaid carers, which represents 6% of the population. Some 46% of carers provide up to 14 hours of unpaid help per week and so on. In a staggering statistic, two thirds of carers were reported as aged between 40 and 64, and 15% were reported as over the age of 65. We are here today for the umpteenth time to appeal to the Government. The only movement we have seen from the Government is that it is not opposing this motion for the first time.",

I have the greatest of respect for the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and she recognised the problems. However, she said that the report would be completed in the third quarter of this year. I do not know if the Minister of State referred to that report. Perhaps I missed it in his speech because I was elsewhere. I would like clarity about where that report is because we should be discussing it today in the context of the abolition of the means test for the carer's allowance. When we go from door to door, from tomorrow or the next day onwards, this issue will be top of the list. The slaughter in Palestine, the carer's allowance means test, public childcare, housing, public transport and health are the issues. They have not changed since I stood for election in 2011 and 2016. I did not hear anyone asking for a reduction in tax, although it would be welcome to people. They asked for services. I will stick to the topic of the day. No economy can function without carers. I have read out the numbers of people who are doing it for nothing. I have read out the numbers of people who are doing it having passed the means test. What is missing is what the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the OECD have pointed out, which is that an economy cannot function without carers. It is time we put a cost on what is not happening — not the cost of paying the carers but the cost of not doing so."

In truth, if any of us lives long enough, we will either need care ourselves or will have to give care. Caring is not a woman's issue. It is not just a family issue behind the closed door of the family home. Caring is a societal issue. Those not involved in caring often think it is a matter of a few hours here and there. In truth, to receive carer's allowance, there are quite strict regulations in place. Applicants have to satisfy a means test, which I have said many times must be abolished. They also have to provide full-time care of at least 35 hours per week to a person who is medically assessed as needing it. That is the reality of what we are talking about.",
                "To be fair to the Minister, she has increased the income disregard for carer's allowance. I acknowledge and welcome that, but that increase is from an extremely low base. Between 2008 and 2021, there was no increase in the income disregard for carer's allowance. We now need to finish the job and the next Government must commit to doing so. As I said earlier, care is a societal issue. It is about how we value those who need care and those who give care. I have called the means test \"the mean test\" on many occasions and that is exactly what it is. Carers in Ireland care for well over 100,000 people. Looking at my own constituency, a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation tells me that the contribution of family carers in County Leitrim, for example, saves the State €120 million every year. In County Sligo, family carers save the State €260 million every year.",

That has changed, but there are still more women than men carers. The idea was that it would be a small income on the side where the man provided the main income for the household. Therefore, whether a person got carer’s allowance was determined entirely by the income of the main breadwinner. We cannot continue with that situation. I want to hear from all party leaders and Independents that in the lifetime of the next government, whoever forms it, we will guarantee the abolition of the means test or, as I call it, the mean test for carer’s allowance."

The value of carers' work in caring for their loved ones should never have been taken for granted, even aside from the estimated savings for the State. Carers feel they have been undervalued, that they are not respected and that their work has not been honoured. They have to fight for everything and for supports and services. Their role carries huge responsibility without much support. They often cannot even go shopping or attend appointments. They put things on the long finger to ensure they are there for their loved one on a daily basis.",
                "The Central Statistics Office reported in the most recent census that the number of people in County Clare providing regular unpaid care rose by 50%. I have no doubt that has increased even further since then. In County Clare, 6.4% of the population give unpaid help or support of this nature. This means County Clare has the sixth highest percentage of unpaid carers nationwide. There are more unpaid carers in County Clare between the ages of 50 and 59 than in any other age bracket, with more than 14% of 50- to 59-year-olds providing unpaid care. The county also has the highest proportion of unpaid carers in the country between the ages of 25 and 29, with more than 4% of people in their mid to late 20s performing unpaid caring duties for a loved one with a long-term illness, health issue or disability. The fact that they have ensured the State has been able to make such massive savings year on year is disgusting and wrong, end of story."

                "The Government is very aware of the valuable work being carried out by family carers. This is evidenced by the extensive measures it has taken to support carers over recent years. The approach to date has been targeted and has involved increases to payment rates in conjunction with earnings disregard increases and targeted cost-of-living lump sum and double payments. This approach was maintained and continued with budget 2025. At €2.6 billion, it is, for the third year in a row, the largest social protection package in the history of the State.",
                "There are two sources of data that provide an estimate of the total number of people providing unpaid care in our society, namely, the census data from 2022 and the Irish health survey 2019, both from the Central Statistics Office. The census data from 2022 showed 299,000 people who self-declared on the census form as providing unpaid care at that time. The Irish health survey from 2019 suggests a higher figure in the order of 517,000, as reported by Family Carers Ireland.",
                "Officials in the Department of Social Protection have estimated the cost of removing the means test for carer's allowance at an additional €600 million a year, based on the current scheme numbers. High-level estimates indicate this figure could increase to €2 billion over time. It is important that we are transparent about costs and about implications for departing from a means-test approach in the social welfare system. Means tests have always been a feature of our social welfare system to ensure resources are targeted at those who need them most. If we were to introduce a universal payment regardless of means, the question needs to be asked as to whether the Department of Social Protection is the appropriate Department to make that payment. What are the knock-on effects? Should disability payments be means-tested? Should jobseeker's payments be means-tested?",
                "As mentioned in the opening statement, the outcome of the work of the interdepartmental group and other work regarding broader means testing taking place in the Department of Social Protection will help to inform any future decisions regarding any changes to the carers' payments, including carer's allowance. In regard to other improvements to non-means-tested care payments, as outlined earlier the Minister for Social Protection has placed carers front and centre in her Department's priorities. It is important to acknowledge that there are a range of other supports for carers provided by the Department of Social Protection which are not based on means assessments, such as the carer's support grant, carer's benefit and the domiciliary care allowance. Under her tenure, the Minister has also progressively improved the rates of these payments and widened their accessibility to family carers.",
                "The carer's support grant is a payment for all carers, even those in receipt of carer's allowance. It can be claimed by carers regardless of their means or social insurance contributions. As part of budget 2025, the annual carer's support grant will be increased by €150 to €2,000. The rate of this grant has increased by €300 under this Government and is now at the highest ever rate. Carer's benefit is based on social insurance contributions. It is a very effective payment for people who may be required to leave the workforce or reduce their working hours to care for a person in need of full-time care. It is payable for a period of up to two years for each care recipient and is estimated to have cost almost €58 million this year. In budget 2025 carer's benefit will be made available to the self-employed for the first time. Domiciliary care allowance is payable to a parent or guardian in respect of a child with a severe disability who requires continual or continuous care and attention substantially over and above the care and attention usually required by a child of the same age. From January, the rate will be increased by €20 to €360 per month. This monthly payment has increased cumulatively by €50.50 since January 2023.",
                "I want to touch on this payment briefly as an example of how the Minister for Social Protection has engaged with and listened to carers. She met with the families of very sick children and heard about the financial stresses they are experiencing while their children are undergoing medical treatments. As a result, she made a number of changes to this payment. These include extending the period during which the domiciliary care allowance can be paid for children in hospital from three months to six months. Earlier this year, she also made a change to make the domiciliary care allowance available for babies who remain in an acute hospital after birth for a period of eight months. While these are relatively small changes, they have been significant for the families who are thrust into these difficult situations, particularly those parents of newborn babies who are unable to bring their babies home after they are born.",
                "In regard to the issue of bringing forward the announced changes to carer's allowance income thresholds, which has been raised by various Deputies in their contributions, to be clear, all budget measures have been given specific dates to enable their implementation from a processing and systems perspective and in light of the available budget 2025 envelope. Adjusting means thresholds is more complicated than increasing payment rates, as it requires reviews of an individual claim and adjustments of claims already in payment. For that reason, changes to means thresholds that are announced on budget day usually take place mid-year. This approach was taken this year when the weekly income disregard for carer's allowance increased to €450 for a single person and to €900 for a couple, only five months ago, in June. The Department needs this lead-in time to undertake the required reviews of means and to contact people whose payments might be affected to give them the opportunity to update the means data the Department has for them. It is also worth pointing out that the earlier implementation date suggested would be of no benefit to 96% of carer's allowance recipients who are solely reliant on the payment as their source of income."

There will be only one political party going to the electorate with a costed plan to abolish the means test. The reason we are doing that is very simple. It is because the means test is a mean test. It is unfair and it fails to recognise the huge service that carers do for our society.",
                "Our position has come about because of our engagements with parents who care for children and young adults with disabilities. We see that because of this Government's failures in so many areas, these parents become occupational therapists, speech and language therapists and specialists in so many areas that they do the State's job. We meet people who care for their elderly parents and again, they have to become the GP, the support and the bedrock to ensure their parents have full lives. We see people who have to care for their husbands or wives in latter years. They save the State countless millions of euro. In fact, it is estimated that carers save the State in excess of €20 billion a year. Rather than recognising the value carers give to our society and the huge service they do for the State, they are instead forced to go through the ignominy of conducting a means test, where somebody else's income discriminates against their ability to get acknowledgement for the huge amount of work they do. Anybody looking at this logically or compassionately will quickly come to the view that the means test needs to be abolished. That is why Sinn Féin will go forward in the next election with a categoric guarantee that should the people put their faith in us and elect us to lead the next Government, this mean test will be abolished once and for all."

                "In response to the speeches of the Ministers of State, while I appreciate the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, is doing Estimates, it is a pity she was not able to pop in for some of the debate, in particular in relation to the delay in threshold increases. Sinn Féin would have gone a lot further, committing €100 million to significantly increase the thresholds, than the Government did with a commitment of approximately €11 million. It is regrettable that the Government is delaying it until the middle of next year. There is no logical reason for that. That it has done it in the past does not excuse it. It speaks to the feeling carers have that they are constantly expected to wait and at the back of the queue. That is a huge amount of their frustration. We tabled amendments to the social welfare Bill but the restrictions of the charge on the Exchequer meant they would not be taken on board. I regret that the Minister has not listened to what we and other Opposition Deputies outlined.",
                "The other issue the Minister of State raised, which I would have given more time to in my opening contribution, relates to the carer's benefit and the potential to make it pay-related. It is a logical proposal. It is not an expensive proposal for the reasons identified and not many people will be more likely to avail of the carer's allowance but for that category of people, whether it is 8%, 20%, 10% or whatever it would be in the end, the fact is there are people who end up providing care very suddenly. They will face a cliff edge because there might be two incomes coming into the household, the mortgage and childcare still have to be paid for and there are different outgoings such as education. Those people currently face a cliff edge. A pay-related approach to jobseeker's makes sense; other payments could be examined in that regard as well. It eminently makes sense for carer's benefit given how suddenly it can arise in certain circumstances in which people have to provide care. I will also mention rates. It is not enough simply to abolish the means test, though I will return to that later. The rates have to increase because there are still carers who receive the full rate of the carer's allowance who are on very low incomes and under pressure because of the cost-of-living crisis, because the last few budgets have not kept pace with the cost-of-living crisis and the value of their payment has depreciated. There are carers on the full rate of the carer's allowance who struggle financially.",
                "To return to the means test, as I said, carers do not do this out of any expectation. They do not do it looking for payment or anything like that. They do it out of love, a sense of responsibility and they deserve it for care for their loved ones. They deserve respect and recognition but they deserve support as well. So many carers work the hours - that is crucially important about this payment and debate. The Minister of State asked what about all the other payments. There is no other payment that the Department of Social Protection administers that demands such a level of labour. They are talking about 35 hours and they cannot work more than 18.5 hours outside of the home. It is not the case that just because you get rid of the means test that everyone who provides even a nugatory amount of care will qualify; they still have to be effectively full-time carers. That is still the case. There will still be conditions. The point is that there are people out there who put in the hours providing care for their loved ones and get nothing at all or very little. I have heard of instances of €2, €5 and €8. Not only is that not right, it is not wise and is not strategically sensible.",
                "We look across the world and hear about the crisis of social care in many instances. We are fortunate in Ireland to have such a strong network of family careers. We should do everything in our power and take every opportunity to reinforce and buttress that to ensure families who care for their loved ones at home are in a position to do so in a way that is financially sustainable and sustainable in every way. There are families who make the decision that it is just not possible for them for financial and other reasons. We need to reinforce that and say to carers we have their backs and that we will give them what they need to ensure that if they care for their loved ones at home, we will back them. There are other issues in relation to respite and other areas of support for carers on which the system falls down profoundly but in this area, it is not that we cannot afford to do it; we cannot afford not to do it."

It is work done by carers who do not get the weekend off, workers who do not get to switch off at the end of their shift. It is work that saves the State billions of euro. It is work, and it deserves to be compensated without forcing carers to jump through the administration hoops of means testing. Carers deserve to know their payment will not be cut suddenly if their partner's income tips them over the edge. People deserve to make the decision to offer care to a loved one without worrying if that decision will be financially disastrous for the family. It is work that happens all of a sudden. All of a sudden, a family member can need support and to be cared for. They need to be able to do that and to be supported by the State. That is why it is so important to abolish the means test.",

                "The Government is a serial waster of the public’s money. Its waste leaves people shaking their heads in disbelief. The lack of accountability angers people. There has been no accountability for the €336,000 bicycle shelter, nor for the €1.4 million security hut or the doubling of costs for modular housing for Ukrainians, and that is before we even mention the children’s hospital. Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil squander taxpayers’ hard-earned money and when they are caught out or challenged, they just shrug their shoulders and dismiss the public’s anger. Perhaps, though, the most mind-boggling example of its waste is its decision to spend €9 million on phone pouches for secondary school students. Contrast this with its failure to fund schools correctly as they struggle to keep the lights and the heating on. There was only €10 million additional money for that. Worse still, the Government could only find less than €3 million for youth mental health services, which are on the floor.",
                "When the Taoiseach was called out for this waste, he claimed this €9 million pouch investment was a once-off cost. The big message in the Minister, Deputy Norma Foley’s article on thejournal.ie. defending the Government’s decision was that \"€9m for phone pouches is a significant once-off investment\". That is not true, as we have learned from documents obtained by my colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, through freedom of information, FOI. What the Minister failed to tell the public was that there will, in fact, be a cost of almost €2 million for these pouches annually. The Government knew this, yet it continues to peddle the spin that this was a once-off investment.",
                "To make matters worse, these documents also show that the Government was presented with several other common-sense options for dealing with mobile phones in schools. Option one, that phones be left in students’ bags with students not allowed to use them during the day, had a cost to the public purse of zero euro. Option two, that phones be handed in at a central point, had a cost to the public purse of zero euro. Option three, the placement of phones in student lockers, had a cost to the public purse of zero euro beyond the cost of the locker. So, the Government turned down three common-sense solutions that would not have cost the public a single red cent and instead went with an option that will cost taxpayers €9 million initially and then a further €2 million every single year. You could not make this up. The incompetence is off the charts.",
                "Dressing this up as a mental health measure is so insulting to young people in mental health crisis who are locked out of the services, care and supports they desperately need. What this shows again is that this Government cannot be trusted to spend the public’s money wisely, cannot be straight with people about its waste and refuses to be accountable for its mess.",

Tuigtear anois go mbeidh costas bliantúil beagnach €2 milliún anois ar an phobal. Why do the Taoiseach and his Government continue to tell people that the €9 million spend on phone pouches is a once-off cost when they know this is not the case? I appeal to him to scrap this scheme and invest the money in mental health services for our young people."

                "I thank Deputy McDonald for raising this issue. I will make a number of points. First, when the Deputy talks about the state of our economy in terms of the use of taxpayers' money, she leaves out a number of facts. She leaves out the fact that this is a country running a budget surplus and that we have managed to put aside billions of euro to protect people from future economic shocks. That decision is looking even better today than it was yesterday in light of global issues. The Deputy forgets that we are able to give people back some of their own money as well. I look forward to debating this Government's record on managing our economy and the public purse versus Sinn Féin's policy of spending it all and leaving nothing for the buffer times or if there are any transatlantic trade shocks, a policy which, quite frankly, looks utterly foolish and ridiculous today.",
                "My second is that the issue of phone pouches was not invented in the Department of Education, in government or by any political party. This came about by listening directly to school principals. I am sure that Deputy McDonald, like me, listens to the radio and I am sure she heard the students on \"Morning Ireland\" a couple of days back after this announcement talking about the benefit they have found from these pouches. I am sure the Deputy has met school principals, including the principal of De La Salle College in Churchtown which introduced these self-locking pouches after staff reported an increase in disruption and how time-consuming it was. The principal highlighted how this initiative had improved the social skills of the students and had seen an increase in participation in extracurricular activities.",
                "This is a Government that is listening. Deputy McDonald talks about listening and how important it is to listen to people on the front line. We have listened to school principals, teachers and students. We have had feedback from many students - I am sure they will be in touch with the Deputy today - in schools that have benefited from this initiative. That is where the idea came from. This is not an obligatory or mandatory measure. Nobody is going to demand that schools take school pouches. If a school wants to avail of this, it will cost about 20 quid per student. That is a €20 investment in the mental health and well-being of a student.",
                "Please do not say to me that it is in any way insulting to link this to mental health. It is not me linking it to mental health; it is the young people themselves. This is about a Government listening and responding because right across the country, different schools have tried different initiatives to deal with smartphones. Deputy McDonald is right that some schools have adopted the suggestions she made, while other schools have tried different approaches. It is important that we help and assist in that regard.",
                "The next point I will make is this. Deputy McDonald suggests this all happened in isolation and it was the only investment in education when this Government has invested a huge amount in education, including in the most recent budget. We have allocated €12 billion to the Department of Education. This will help students, parents and education staff and it includes €51 million to extend the free school book scheme to students, benefiting 940,000 students. Sinn Féin called on us to increase the capitation rate and we have increased it from €200 to €224 per student in primary school and from €345 to €386 per student in post-primary school. This 12% increase will assist schools with increased day-to-day running costs because I know running costs are a real issue. In addition, we have provided €45 million in cost-of-living supports for all primary, special and post-primary schools in the free scheme to help them deal with costs. We have employed more special needs assistants, special education teachers and teachers in general.",
                "The most breathtaking thing about Deputy McDonald's presentation today is that in Northern Ireland, where Sinn Féin holds the Department of Finance, it is rolling out a similar initiative and, you know what, it is costing a hell of a lot more."

When Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael’s alliance started they were the Civil War parties, but now it seems they are more like the phoney war parties. For weeks there has been sniping in the media. It is not about policy, because it does not seem like there are many policy differences between them, but about personalities. Political debate has been reduced to petty insults and desperate jostling for position in advance of an election. It is a fairly ridiculous end to what has been a disastrous Government for so many people. There are hundreds and thousands of people out there who have lost hope in a better future here and who are utterly disconnected from the success story this Government is trying to spin. Instead, the Government should be talking about the 500,000 adults living in their childhood bedrooms and how to address that. How does the Taoiseach think they feel when, for example, they hear the Tánaiste say we have turned a corner on housing? They do not see a corner but a dead end. They see their ability to build a life and put down roots in their communities destroyed by disastrous housing policies. Average house price increases of €85,000 in just four years are not a success. For individuals and families desperate to own their own homes, it is a betrayal.",
                "Disabled people have also been let down. When this Government took office it said disability was a priority. When the Taoiseach assumed his role he even set up a new Cabinet subcommittee to focus on this issue. What has it achieved? Nothing. Services are worse than they were when this Government took office. People no longer even have any kind of expectation they will get the critical supports they need. They have learned by experience the only things they are guaranteed from the State are waiting lists and excuses, yet its members somehow still claim disability was a priority for this Government. This is why the Social Democrats are making a full Minister for disability a dealbreaker in any programme for Government talks. We need the political weight of a Ministry and the political will that has so blatantly been missing for so long. Until that happens I do not believe anything will change.",
                "I am sure that during this election campaign, the Taoiseach will insist his plans in housing, disability and a whole range of other areas are working or that somehow they will start working and that all that is needed is a bit more time, a few more years, and we will begin to see the results. However, we have been listening to the same lines from Fine Gael for nearly 14 years. Fine Gael has been in office for almost my entire adult life and the Taoiseach has been a Minister for most of that time. The party has had more than enough time and more than enough money to address these issues and it has not. Why should anybody believe Fine Gael will solve the crises facing the country when it is Fine Gael policy that has led us to them?"

                "I would never age a colleague, but I do not think there is that big a difference in our ages so I am not sure how I have been a Government Minister almost all the Deputy's adult life. Leaving that aside, she likes to portray this Government's record in a certain way. That is fine, it is her job and I look forward to debating that on the campaign trail. This is the Government that steered the country through Covid, steered the country through the biggest inflationary crisis, created jobs for people, has been able to give people back some of their own money including additional child benefit payments as recently as this week, and has been able to take a range of measures that have made children's and parents' lives better. These include the roll-out of free schoolbooks and hot school meals. Now that the risk of a transatlantic trade shock is rising, we have managed to set aside resources to ensure my children never have to live through the austerity our generation did, so I am proud of much of the progress we made.",
                "Moreover, when it comes to moving people out of their childhood bedroom, 50,000 people have been able to avail of the help to buy scheme. That is a scheme I do not think the Social Democrats support, meaning they would pull the rug from under first-time buyers.",
                "The Deputy asked a very direct question, namely what difference has been made since I decided to chair the Cabinet committee on disability. I will tell her four things. The first is we have ratified the optional protocol to the UN convention, which is something she feels strongly about. We got it done. Second, we have managed to adopt a proposal from the Labour Party on assessments of need and utilising private capacity to ensure more than 1,000 additional children got assessments of need they would not have got otherwise this summer. That happened. They are real children and those benefits have happened as a result of our work together. Third, we have managed to start the process of putting therapists back in special schools. That work is under way and is making a real difference. It is not saying to a parent of a child with special needs they must go from the school to a health waiting list, but actually putting therapists in the schools. We will continue to roll that out. Fourth, under that Cabinet committee on disability, we have worked across Departments to expand the number of training places in Irish universities to ensure we train enough people to work in speech and language therapy, physiotherapy and occupational therapy. No matter who is in government or what the Department is called, we need more people to be able to work in this area.",
                "The Deputy’s suggestion of a dedicated stand-alone Minister for disability has merit. The only counterpoint to make is that work somewhat started this time with the Minister, Deputy O’Gorman, and then we had a migration crisis and the likes of that as well, in terms of the breadth of issues that Department is now dealing with. The Social Democrats’ suggestion about a stand-alone Minister for disability is a constructive, sensible one, but I would like to see how we would make that Department work to cut through the silos and deliver for people with disabilities."

Then, when he is pointing at things that have happened, he says now we are offering more private solutions rather than investing in the public services we need to address disability services. It is brazen to claim that somehow Fine Gael or the Taoiseach is going to be the solution to these issues without acknowledging that things have got worse, that people cannot access special education, that people are travelling potentially two and a half hours and not being able to go to school at all. It seems the Taoiseach thinks the threadbare services are some kind of a given, when Ireland is a rich country that should be able to provide these services. Fine Gael has had a really long time to try to address that and the Taoiseach has not even acknowledged that. I hope people see through the fact this is a tried, tested and failed Government on this issue and on housing."

This is coupled with the fact we have been talking about putting in place a bus lane from Claregalway into the city since 2007.

We have a situation where traffic is piling up on the outer edge of our city and is not getting in or around the city. We need a comprehensive plan and to put in place certain instruments that will start to build traffic flow into our city. Otherwise, we will be losing jobs and we will be losing sight of ourselves.

First, I agree with him on the need to continue to invest and deliver more projects around Galway city and county and to address the huge congestion issues. I would point, and my colleagues have reminded me, to some of the progress that has been made in recent times. The Minister, Deputy Ryan, has made the point to me that the cross-city bus link has just got planning permission from An Bord Pleanála. When the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, was working in that Department, we saw significant investment in Oranmore and Ceannt train stations. These were significant measures that I know have made a difference.",

It was approved by An Bord Pleanála with conditions in December 2021, as Deputy Canney's constituents are all too aware of, but subsequently three applications for judicial reviews were submitted to the High Court, which imposed a stay on progressing the scheme. An Bord Pleanála subsequently decided not to oppose the judicial review taken by Friends of the Irish Environment against the decision to grant planning permission. On 30 January 2023, the High Court quashed the An Bord Pleanála decision to approve the scheme and remitted the application back to the board. An Bord Pleanála is to reconsider the application and make a new decision. It has requested further information from the county council, including an updated environmental impact assessment and a Natura impact statement. That project has now been remitted to An Bord Pleanála for consideration.",

It is a component of the Galway transport strategy and I hope this is something we can make progress on.

I assure the people of the Deputy's region that investing in both this road and in public transport remains an absolute priority."

This will be seen in time as a pivotal milestone in this regard. I note it is a review that has been very warmly welcomed in Galway and Mayo. I point out that the project has been highlighted in the review as one that the Deputy has correctly noted the Government can progress in a short timeframe. It is unlikely we can progress it in the next 24 to 48 hours but it does give a very strong case to those of us fortunate enough to be elected or re-elected to Dáil Éireann to have the progress for that in any future programme for Government, whosoever may make up that Government.

That is an important point.",

We have HIQA, and I will stick to HIQA. The Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, is telling the Taoiseach about the latest progress of Merlin Park and I welcome that. Let us deal, however, with what I am telling him about the regional hospital, which services more than a million people in a population from Donegal down to Galway. The latest HIQA reports tell us there were 29 patients awaiting an inpatient bed. That is 29 people. The term \"boarded out\" is used. A year ago, it drew up a report which told us it was grossly overcrowded. This year it is worse, so I do not know what language is left if it was grossly overcrowded last year. In addition, we now have 31 patients in hospital who are ready to go out but there are no beds in any step-down facilities or nursing homes. That is the regional hospital in Galway.",

Transitions of care are not being complied with because I have provided the Taoiseach with information on 31 patients waiting to get out.",
                "What is not recorded is the impact of care not given, notwithstanding the great efforts of the staff. Imagine if we recorded the impact of people on trolleys. Dr. Fergal Hickey tells us ad nauseam that there are at least 350 premature deaths every single year directly related to the time spent on trolleys. When I was here as a newly elected TD in 2017 and when the Taoiseach was the Minister for Health, he provided me with a detailed answer about an options appraisal, which he told me would be published in 2018. That options appraisal was duly published. A brand-new hospital was strongly recommended; not an elective hospital, although I welcome that. A brand-new hospital was recommended and the elective hospital was to be part of that.",

Bed numbers have grown too, as 30 new beds have been opened at University Hospital Galway, meaning bed numbers have risen from 684 in 2020 to 714 in 2024. Under our hospital bed expansion plan, a total of 247 new and replacement beds are due to be delivered to University Hospital Galway out to 2031, of which 198 will be delivered between now and 2028.

That will allow the hospital to progress the planned work on the new emergency department.

I accept and know when I go to Galway that there is a lot more to do with the hospital.

Some of the living conditions for citizens in our inner cities are reminiscent of another era, such is the level of hardship and the extent to which there is overcrowding and damp. There is a real need for regeneration. People have been waiting a decade or more for the promised regeneration to be delivered on. The flats on Dominick Street are one example.

This is infuriating for the thousands of people struggling to find somewhere affordable to live. It is no wonder home ownership levels are at their lowest in more than 50 years. The Government voted down amendments put forward by the Social Democrats to ensure that at least 50% of new-build apartments would be ring-fenced for individuals and families to buy. Allowing homes to be hoovered up by funds drives up prices and drives down home ownership levels. Why did the Taoiseach vote down our amendments and why did he side with the funds and against individuals and families?"

The Government has burned through €44 billion on capital projects with less than one third of a fair share for Waterford.

Waterford people have been loyal to their parties for generations and now those parties are fielding just one candidate apiece. I suppose at least they are self-aware of how much they have let us down. I have kept my word to my constituents and it has been my honour to stand here and fight for them, but can the Taoiseach and his Government say the same?

How are we going to learn from our mistakes if we do not have a proper, meaningful, independent inquiry with teeth and powers of compellability? This evaluation is only a charade, and people's lives mean nothing, with the suffering, the mental health issues, the damage to businesses and families and everything else.

I am told there are currently seven closed in the Diamond ward. This is a ward with three rooms that are currently being used for storage space, I am told. The ward was opened to much fanfare. The then Minister announced that seven new beds were to open in Monaghan hospital when, in fact, there were only two additional beds; regardless, those beds are now unused, even as several families try desperately to secure a step-down or rehabilitation bed in Monaghan hospital. Will the Taoiseach intervene? I have asked questions to the Minister for Health and he has fobbed them off to the HSE, which has not answered me. Will the Taoiseach intervene to ensure Monaghan hospital is used to its full capacity and that every single bed space is utilised?"

It has written to us about this. Is the Taoiseach aware of the status of the appeal and when the club will finally find out whether it is successful?"

We now know that vulture funds own almost as much student accommodation as the universities themselves. We now have a situation where in Cork and Dublin, there is more vulture fund-owned student accommodation than beds owned by the universities themselves, and Galway is actually getting to that point now as well. There are 1,000 beds proposed in Menlo in Galway. The issue here is that for students and people in the local community, they do not have the access to affordable accommodation to rent or to buy. This kind of development delivers neither of these things. It is also in a Gaeltacht area. How is it possible for vulture fund-led accommodation of 1,000 beds to adhere to Irish language-speaking guidelines for a Gaeltacht area?"

I am sure we will all be putting forward our proposals as to how we can ramp that up. It is the way to do this. There will always be some private accommodation and that is fine but we need to have much more university-owned and taxpayer-invested student accommodation. We have started that process and I hope that together, we can achieve a lot more in the years ahead."

The benefit to the participants and to the community has been immeasurable and the value for money, according to a Pobal review, is that for every €1 spent, there is a €3 benefit back to the community. However, the RSS has not been supported enough by this Government. Supervisors are still locked out of the pension scheme. Participants still have to retire at 66 and not 70, and the top-up on their social welfare should be increased to at least €50. Can the Taoiseach do something about that because very few people leave it? The Department of Social Protection should invite everyone on farm assist schemes to participate because numbers are falling but the structures need to be put in place so this work can continue in communities."

The previous psychologist was in that position for an extensive period but it was a planned retirement. It was known that he was going to retire and he has not been replaced as such. It is a massive concern to my constituents in Clare. It means they are only able to receive the services from the psychiatrist, which is a huge concern of mine. The Taoiseach mentioned that the ceiling and the pay and numbers strategy are not impacting recruitment. Is he able to explain why this post has been left vacant for this period?

I am asking him to get his full file from Crumlin hospital and the other relevant hospitals, and I am asking him for a second opinion from abroad and to facilitate that. The Taoiseach may say that with regard to some of these children, he and I are not clinicians and they cannot travel. I am asking the Taoiseach to use the technology that is available - whether that is Teams, Zoom or whatever it is - to make the files available so that experts from abroad can at least give a second opinion to the families. It is not right to send a 16-year-old home to be made comfortable. That may be the case for a 96-year-old person but a 16-year-old boy deserves more than this, and his family deserves more. Could the Taoiseach connect these desperate families with the experts from abroad for a second opinion?"

                "This Government is taking all necessary steps to dismantle organised crime. Given the increasingly transnational nature of organised crime, it is absolutely imperative that Ireland strategically strengthens judicial co-operation in criminal matters with other countries as part of our overall efforts to combat this serious global threat. It is only through national authorities working together on an international basis that we can effectively fight serious cross-border organised crime and protect the rule of law, while making our countries safer and more secure. As has been the case for many of our EU counterparts, the agreement of these bilateral treaties with the UAE will be of significant support in tackling organised crime and transnational drug trafficking gangs.",
                "These bilateral treaties have been negotiated quickly and efficiently. I informed the Government that I was opening negotiations with the UAE on bilateral treaties on extradition and mutual legal assistance in December last year. Since then, there has been extensive engagement between myself and the Emirati Minister of Justice, Al Nuaimi, and between my officials and their Emirati counterparts. The focus of these negotiations has been to ensure that the processes for extradition and mutual legal assistance between Ireland and the UAE are structured and simplified, while also ensuring essential safeguards are maintained. Following detailed negotiations, treaty texts have been agreed and subject to national ratification procedures, including in the Dáil today, that satisfy lreland’s objectives and requirements. This is particularly the case regarding respect for national law and the protection of human rights. Ireland's red lines relating to human rights standards have been firmly maintained and appropriate safeguards included in the text of the treaties. These cover protected characteristics, the non-imposition of the death penalty, torture or cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment and other relevant assurances. The extradition treaty allows extradition to be requested for any offence that is punishable by a sentence of at least one year in both Ireland and the UAE, with revenue offences being included within the scope of the treaty.",
                "An extradition request must be refused in any of the following cases: there are substantial grounds for believing that the request for extradition has been made for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing the person sought for reasons of race, religion, ethnic origin, nationality, language, political opinions, sex or status, or that the person’s position in the criminal proceedings may be prejudiced for any of those reasons; the offence for which extradition is sought is punishable by death, unless a sentence of capital punishment is not imposed on the person sought, or if for procedural reasons such condition cannot be complied with, a written undertaking is provided that the death penalty if imposed shall not be carried out; there are substantial grounds for believing that the person sought has been or would be subjected to torture or cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment, or to proceedings which do not ensure the respect of basic defence rights. These are the three examples of where an extradition would not be agreed and it will not be permitted to extradite Irish citizens to the UAE, or Emirati citizens to Ireland, under the terms of this treaty. There are a number of further mandatory grounds for refusal of an extradition request, including where it relates to a political offence, a military offence that is not also an offence under ordinary criminal law, it would be contrary to the principle of double jeopardy, or would jeopardise the sovereignty, security, public order or essential interests of the State.",
                "The mutual legal assistance treaty provides for the widest measure of mutual legal assistance in criminal matters, meaning investigations, prosecutions and proceedings in relation to any offence which at the time of the request for assistance falls within the jurisdiction of the requesting party. Types of assistance to be provided include the taking of statements, provision of evidentiary items, execution of requests for search and seizure, identification, tracing, freezing, seizing, confiscation and disposing of proceeds of crime and any form of co-operation that is not contrary to national law. The mutual legal assistance treaty contains the same corresponding safeguards regarding protected characteristics, the death penalty and torture or cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment. It also provides that assistance shall be refused where required assurances have not been provided, including in relation to the protection, disclosure, use or transmission of information or evidence, or to the ability of a defendant to challenge any evidence supplied if the material is to be used at trial.",
                "Again, there are a number of mandatory grounds for refusal of a request for assistance, including where it relates to a political offence, a military offence that is not also an offence under ordinary or common law, or would jeopardise the sovereignty, security, public order or essential interests of the State. Assistance may also be refused if the double criminality requirement is not met, the request relates to an offence which carries a maximum sentence of less than six months, an investigation, prosecution or proceedings are ongoing in the State, or the execution of the request would be contrary to the principle of double jeopardy.",
                "A novel inclusion in these treaties, as compared with Ireland’s existing extradition and mutual legal assistance agreements, is the inclusion of provisions relating to data protection. International treaties and conventions relating to co-operation in criminal matters have not traditionally included provisions on data protection as standard. However, this is changing, and more modern instruments now include provisions on the protection of personal data. Legal advice has been received which has confirmed that it is appropriate for data protection provisions to be included in both the extradition and mutual legal assistance treaties.",
                "Over the past two years, co-operation between Ireland and the UAE on combating transnational organised crime has been significantly stepped up. These treaties cement this successful co-operation and represent a crucial step in intensifying the combined fight to combat this serious threat. In addition to greater judicial co-operation, I have taken a number of steps to support international policing co-operation, including approval for the posting of Garda liaison officers overseas. There is excellent co-operation between An Garda Síochána and their counterparts in the UAE, and the deployment of a Garda liaison officer to Abu Dhabi last year has been key to this successful co-operation. Dubai police also travelled to Dublin recently to assist members of An Garda Síochána with a large transnational organised crime investigation arising from the seizure of 2.2 tonnes of cocaine on the MV Matthew off the coast of Waterford.",
                "While I cannot comment on any individual case, any person involved in organised crime should know there is no hiding place; they will face justice. Many organised crime gangs think they can evade justice simply by crossing borders; they cannot. The State will do everything in its power to bring those who spread misery in so many of our communities to justice. These bilateral treaties on mutual legal assistance and extradition are an important tool in this regard. The approval of these two agreements demonstrates that none of us here will allow borders to be barriers to effective criminal justice co-operation. These treaties will provide a sound legal basis, grounded in international law, for Irish and Emirati judicial authorities to co-operate effectively in criminal matters, including criminal investigations, prosecutions and proceedings. Therefore, the Government has no hesitation in commending these motions to the House. I ask all Deputies to support these motions."

I visited it myself. My wife worked there a number of years ago. It has therefore been an ideal country in that part of the world for certain figures to do business in. Even if they are forced to move on, it is unlikely that their operations will not be somewhat disrupted. Some good work has been done recently by An Garda Síochána and it is to be commended on the ongoing co-operation with European, Middle Eastern and American counterparts. The Government has brought this proposal before us. That it is happening in the last week of this Dáil is a disappointment. The lack of any intent to move reforms on the Offences Against the State Act is also to be considered, and why that has not been done despite the annual votes.",
                "An important aspect to consider when adjudicating on this extradition treaty is how justice functions within the UAE. Amnesty International has had some criticisms about the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly in that country. Its report says the Abu Dhabi judicial department had a social media slogan saying that your freedom stops at the boundary of the law and there are 15-year prison sentences for damaging the reputation or prestige of the President, for example. Human Rights Watch has also had criticism in its country report on the UAE. It states that, \"As of March 2023, Emirati authorities continued to incarcerate with no legal basis at least 51 Emirati prisoners who completed their sentences between 1 month and nearly 4 years ago.\"",
                "Closer to home, we had the case of Tori Towey, the Roscommon woman who was detained for certain offences that are not criminal offences here. I commend my party colleagues, na Teachtaí Kerrane and McDonald, who were active on that case. Ms Towey was eventually released.",
                "Two things need to be borne in mind, the need to end safe havens for serious criminals and the safeguards that govern extradition. On safeguards, there is a requirement, as the Minister stated, for dual criminality, namely that people are charged with an offence that is punishable by imprisonment in Ireland and in the other country for at least a year. The offence must be the same in the two countries and people may not be extradited if they will be held in custody for the purpose of investigation, notwithstanding that there are concerns about other types of offences and the whole criminal justice system in the UAE. The applications must be made to the High Court and as Mr. Alan Eustace put it in the Trinity College Law Review:",
                "The extradition hearing in the High Court is not concerned with the guilt or innocence of the person; the judge must issue the extradition order once she is satisfied that Ireland has an extradition agreement or treaty with the requesting country and that the request is made in keeping with the 1965 Act and such an agreement.",
                "According to the briefing paper which was provided by the Department, there are additional safeguards in this situation which cover protected characteristics including the death penalty, as the Minister indicated; torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment; and other relevant assurances, which are just as critical for campaigners worried about Irish citizens fleeing abusive relationships in the UAE and coming home. It will not be permitted to extradite Irish citizens to the UAE, or Emirati citizens to Ireland, in these circumstances under the terms of the treaty. There is mutual trust and confidence when Ireland enters into an extradition agreement with another country but it is important to ensure that such trust can be counted on. Therefore some restrictions are appropriate to see how the extradition requests develop in the future.",
                "The briefing note also notes there are safeguards around human rights. We would ideally see more assurances in this area as it is vital that the relevant assurances are given, for example about the imposition of the death penalty, which still applies in the UAE. There should also be appropriate assurances about prison conditions in that country and the right to a fair trial. I note the reference to assurances about torture or degrading treatment, but it would be better to have more information on the list of issues referred to in the extradition treaty. It is a basic proposition that Ireland will not extradite someone if there will be a flagrant denial of justice in another country. That was the phrase used by the Supreme Court in recent case law. It is a high threshold for people opposing extradition to prove they would suffer a flagrant denial of justice in the requesting country. Notwithstanding that, given the history of some trial procedures in parts of the Middle East, as outlined in the Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch reports, it is vital this is protected. It is possible to envisage persons whose extradition is sought to the UAE challenging these issues in the courts.",
                "It is also important that if people are extradited, they are not subject to rendition, transfer to another country, without permission first being sought from Ireland. There have been some difficulties with this in the past and the briefing note does not refer to that. Will the Minister expand on the rendition aspect?",
                "On balance, the need for international co-operation in tackling crime gangs who themselves collaborate across borders and all around the globe and the fact that this is an area governed heavily by legal precedent within the State's control means Sinn Féin will be supporting this treaty.",
                "A final note refers to the measures on mutual legal assistance contained in the treaty. The Government states the measures can be taken on, and this is another direct quote, \"any form of co-operation that is not contrary to national law\". There are issues that will, unlike extradition requests, not be governed by the courts on a case-by-case basis. Perhaps the national security examiner might have a role to play in relation to these. If there are any further points to be made by the Government on this matter, we would like to hear them.",
                "All that said, we support this motion and hope that continuing strides which are being made against organised crime and worldwide criminal gangs will continue."

                "The growth of criminal gangs operating out of this jurisdiction is a phenomenon that has developed incredible legs in recent decades. The reach of these criminal gangs goes well beyond our borders and the scale now rivals some of the biggest international cartels we have read about in other jurisdictions down through the decades, such as the Mafia or criminal cartels operating out of Mexico and countries in South America. We need to take action against that and one of the things that needs to be absolutely crystal clear is that there is no safe haven for those criminal overlords who can direct their criminal enterprises from the safety of another jurisdiction and cause mayhem and carnage among our population and many other populations, because the harm they do is certainly international.",
                "I welcome the efforts of the Government to ensure there are no safe havens, certainly none criminals want to go to. Ultimately, if the only places left for these people to go are places like Russia and North Korea, that would be a desirable objective. It is certainly galling for our law agents to look at and know that godfathers of crime who have caused mayhem in this State are able to enjoy themselves in luxury in jurisdictions such as the UAE. We need to close down those safe havens. There is no doubt about that. I commend the growing co-operation between An Garda Síochána, Interpol and other international police forces. The co-operation with the FBI in the United States is of extreme importance, because of its capacity and reach in working with us. I also welcome the appointment of Garda liaison officers who are on the ground in a number of jurisdictions now. I would be interested in hearing from the Minister how she intends to develop all of that.",
                "Having said that, we have to be careful in any international treaty on extradition to fundamentally safeguard human rights. It is a cornerstone of what we believe in. The Minister has recited in her speech today, and in the briefing note we received, the safeguards she has written into the treaty to protect against cruel and unusual treatment and torture, and to protect anyone who could face a death penalty. None of that could be tolerated. Reasonable points were made by my Sinn Féin colleague about conditions operating in the UAE and we would welcome hearing more views on that.",
                "I only have a few minutes and I want to make one other point. There is growing co-operation between Ireland and the UAE, which I welcome, but we need to use our influence with the UAE on other matters. A cause of enormous concern now is the ongoing carnage in Sudan. It is almost overshadowed because there are so many other terrible things happening. For a little more than a year, Sudan has been the site of probably the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. We rightly focus on Gaza and the genocide that is happening there, but Sudan is on the brink of the worst famine in the world. According to the UN refugee agency, more than 7 million people have been internally displaced and 2 million have fled to neighbouring countries. Half the population of Sudan, 25 million people, are in dire need of humanitarian assistance now and 20,000 people have been killed. The biggest supplier of arms to that conflict according to the UN is the UAE, which has its own interests in these matters. I do not have time to develop the point any further, other than to say, that I hope that in our growing co-operation with the UAE we will seek to appeal to them to stop the support in arms and other military equipment to the warring factions because peace is so far away in Sudan right now and literally millions of people are on the verge of a humanitarian catastrophe.",
                "While we rightly focus on Lebanon, Gaza and Ukraine, that catastrophe could outstrip them all in terms of the harm it is doing to human beings."

                "We will also be supporting this motion. Having an extradition treaty with the UAE is desirable. It is galling to see individuals who have wreaked havoc living in comfort in another jurisdiction and also operating without any sanction. These are people who in some cases are household names. However, we must remember that individual cases do not make good law. That has often been said, rightly so. In looking at this extradition treaty we must consider it in a wider context, not just through the lens of organised crime. We must consider its durability in the long term.",
                "It is important that there are safeguards because we have two very different cultures and two very distinct ways of dealing with issues. Matters that we would consider criminal might not be so considered in the UAE and vice versa. It is important that human rights are central to the treaty. I note there were quite a lot of safeguards outlined in the document we were provided with, but more could be considered.",
                "We must also consider how we got to the point where we have these home-grown crime gangs and the extent of their power, which is international at this stage. That comes back to how organised crime groups are allowed to develop, in respect of the level of policing and the lack of proactive policing. We have seen that in such places as Limerick, Louth and the north inner city of Dublin where communities have been blighted and reputational damage is done to them as a consequence of people being allowed to get to a point where the population can say the dogs in the street could have told us. It nearly seems to get to a pitch before it is dismantled. That is because a proactive policing model is lacking to the extent required. The Garda Commissioner rightly told the Policing Authority that the total strength of the Garda is 14,064 but he made the point that this is inadequate. I know there is a constant intake of recruits to Templemore but the output is very slow to emerge, especially given the number of people retiring, sometimes mid-career because of the competitive jobs market and their skill set.",
                "We cannot look at the treaty in isolation. We must look at how these home-grown gangs got to the point where they are so powerful internationally. We cannot allow that to continue. This is about dealing with things at a much lower level than they have been dealt with and breaking up these gangs at a much earlier stage.",
                "I have a question for the Minister about Article 24 of the treaty. We are doing our piece on the motion. Could she give us an update in respect of the UAE's side and the timeline for completion of communications through the diplomatic channels? I know the dates on which the treaties were signed last month, but the Minister might just confirm them.",
                "I read an article by Conor Gallagher in today's The Irish Times. The Garda Síochána Inspectorate has made a recommendation regarding the way in which An Garda Síochána handles organised and transnational crime. It recommends that informants who provide intelligence to the Garda on organised crime activity should be permitted to commit criminal offences in certain circumstances. I ask the Minister to comment on that and indicate what her views are on it. I have some concerns in that regard and I would be surprised if others do not feel the same way. The Minister might elaborate on it."

                "I do not think anybody is going to be sorry if people involved in violent criminality are extradited from the United Arab Emirates. This arrangement facilitates that extradition and the bringing to justice of people involved in violent criminality. However, to put it very mildly, I have grave concerns about the UAE's human rights credentials. I see in the Minister's speech, which I have just looked through, that there is a lot of conditionality around all of this and that she is cognisant of the human rights aspect of it, as it were. It is important to say this is a regime that has a brutal disregard for human rights. It has dozens of prisoners of conscience. This is a regime in which people can get long stretches in prison, up to 15 years, for damaging the reputation or prestige of the President. Every single one of us would be in prison for the comments that are made on a regular basis in this Dáil in robust political debate. People would get a 15-year prison sentence in the United Arab Emirates for saying things that we, and members of the public, say every day about what we see as the policy failures of politicians of all stripes.",
                "That is the sort of regime we are dealing with, The UAE is closely associated with Saudi Arabia, which has a similarly brutal sort of authoritarian character and has been up to its neck in an horrific, near genocidal war against the people of Yemen for a long period. Its weapons have slaughtered tens of thousands of people in Yemen. Much to the anger and fury of ordinary people in the Middle East, in particular the Palestinian people who are suffering under the horror of a genocidal assault by Israel but also decades of apartheid, occupation and ethnic cleansing, the UAE is also one of the few regimes that gives free passage to the people and political representatives of Israel to go to that country. Were it not for recent events and the outrage being expressed across the region at what Israel is doing to the Palestinians, the UAE was planning to have an agreement with Israel that was mediated, interestingly enough, by Donald Trump to normalise relations between it and Israel. That is despite the horror of what Israel is doing and despite the fact that it does not represent the vast majority of people in the Middle East or very likely in the UAE itself. It has a terrible record on the treatment of migrant workers, who make up about 80% of the population of the country.",
                "This is a brutal, nasty regime that is more than willing to do business with the regime in Israel that is committing genocidal atrocities and war crimes against the people of Palestine. It is important to put these things on the record because this is not some sort of normal regime. It is part of an architecture of oppression. Effectively, the regime was established by the colonial powers as part of a project to control and dominate the Middle East and set up dictatorial regimes to prevent the self-determination of the people of the Middle East and their ability to control their own destinies. That is actually what this regime is part of. I just hope that this is not a step towards legitimising a very brutal regime that is a block to the self-determination of the people of the Middle East and their ability to have freedom, justice and to control their own destinies, and which has very scant regard for human rights."

I worked on behalf of a citizen of Clonmel and I want to thank the former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, and various Ministers, as well as the former Taoiseach, who helped out. The gentleman who was incarcerated there was from Clonmel. When he was incarcerated for so many years, his wife moved to Dublin. I was pleasantly informed, when I raised the matter here with the then Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, that his wife was a constituent of the Taoiseach's. The support that we got from the Department of Foreign Affairs was so important. I thank them for their engagement. That man went to hell and back because of a situation that was not of his own making. He worked for a Clonmel company. Unfortunately, like the crash here, there was a crash and he happened to be the paymaster, paying the bills. He was deemed to be responsible but there was no justice over there. There was no 90-day wait for money or whatever. He was incarcerated and deemed to be responsible for his company's inability to pay whomsoever. The support we got was so important. I want to thank the officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and those working in our embassies around the world. I dealt with another case lately which turned out okay, thank God. A chap from my own constituency was missing in that part of the world as well but thankfully, he turned up safely. Again, the embassy stood ready to help.",

We must accept and work with whoever is the president of any country. The US was one of the first democracies. We have admired it for years. We saw all of the shenanigans in the last number of years but now that is the past. The people have spoken. Not only have the people spoken but I believe, although I have not been watching the coverage, the different states and electoral colleges have also spoken. There is a President-elect with a clear victory in all areas. I said to the Taoiseach earlier, when on my phone arrived a lovely picture that he decided to tweet of a baseball cap that arrived in his office, according to his own words, with \"Harris\" on it that he was electioneering for the candidate there. Not only that but in 2015 when he was a young Minister, he made a ferocious attack on Donald Trump. At that time, he was not President but he was aiming to be President. I refer to former President Trump, now President-elect. Deputy Harris said that any day in office is a good day when he has a different opinion and view from that of Donald Trump and Elon Musk. Mr. Musk has to be reined in, as we know. He is a private businessman, as is former President Trump. We have to be very careful, as I said earlier. We have to praise the bridge as we go over. The Taoiseach made a recent statement again along the same lines. It was very ill-judged to be making comments when there was an election process going on over there. There is one starting here, when he gets the courage to blow the whistle, and we do not want interference from abroad. We have to work with all governments."

                "I thank colleagues who know what we are talking about here for their support, in the most part, for this motion today. We all want the same thing here and the people of this country want the same thing. Where a person has committed a serious crime, where a group of individuals are spreading misery, mayhem, death and destruction across our communities, where they are dragging young people into lives of crime and misery, it is so important that they are held accountable in this country. That is what this is about. It is about making sure that those who are responsible for inflicting nothing but misery on our country can be held accountable here. It is, as Deputies have suggested, about tightening the net and closing as many doors as possible to make sure that those who think they can cross borders and set up a better, nicer life while still continuing to conduct their criminal activities from those countries cannot do so. It is about closing as many doors as possible and providing fewer spaces for them to go to. No matter where they go, we will send a very clear message that we will continue to engage with every single country to put these types of measures and structures in place so that they can be brought home and held accountable in our own courts and by our own justice system. That has been absolutely imperative throughout these negotiations. While this is happening now, just before the Dáil breaks, the negotiations only began last Christmas. This has been done in a relatively short period although we have not, in any way, cut any corners. There has been a huge amount of work done by my team in the Department of Justice, working with members of the Garda, with officials in the UAE and its police service and judiciary, to make sure that we get this right. Human rights have been the basis of this at every step of the way, not just on our side but also from the UAE. We are all absolutely committed to making sure that all of these measures that I have outlined are very clearly in place.",
                "Deputy Catherine Murphy asked a specific question. Article 10 of the extradition treaty outlines very clearly that we cannot surrender, or the country that has sought the extradition cannot surrender, a person to a third country or third party without the consent of the requesting party. That is very clearly stated in the document as outlined.",
                "In terms of the overall work that has been done, Deputy Murphy referenced the inspectorate report which has only just been published. There are quite a number of recommendations in that report. I have to point out that there is quite a lot of positive commentary within the report, including an acknowledgement that there has been a huge amount of financial investment and other resources in An Garda Síochána to enable its members to work on a transnational basis with Interpol, Europol, their European and US counterparts and others across the world. We are building up those relationships because we know that crime knows no boundaries and because of the way in which criminals are now working and operating. A huge amount of positive work has been done and the report this week makes recommendations on how we can strengthen that work and do even more. What we are discussing here today really complements that.",
                "So much of the work I have done over the past four years has been about building up and investing in capacity. Almost half a billion euro more has been invested in the Garda over the past four years alone. That is not just going into increasing our numbers. I acknowledge that the numbers are not where I want them to be but they are gradually increasing. I can see that momentum building and I want that to continue even more, but we are also investing in technology, equipment and in building those relationships, in expanding the number of liaison officers that we have right across the world.",
                "We must ensure that the Garda has the stations, all of the equipment and everything else it needs to do its job as effectively as possible. When these structures are put in place, the Garda must be supported to bring these criminals home and ensure they face the full rigour of the law. I thank colleagues for their support.",
                "We will always ensure that as we build relationships, we engage on matters and different issues. While we will not always agree on certain matters, building those relationships and working and engaging with colleagues from right across the globe will mean we start to build and agree a common purpose and interest. We can then use that when it comes to peace. Deputy Howlin referenced the atrocities that are happening in Sudan. We are a small country that is focused on peace and we will use our voice to do everything we can to bring about peace no matter where in the world. That is the case in respect of our relationship with the UAE and other countries.",
                "I again thank colleagues for their support of these motions, which are about assuring criminals who think they can cross boundaries to evade justice that there is nowhere to hide. Bit by bit, we will close every door available to them and will ensure they can be brought home to face justice in this country."

                "The Houses of the Oireachtas Commission came into existence on 1 January 2004 under the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Act 2003. The founding commission legislation had two principal consequences. First, the commission became the sanctioning authority for expenditure, for deciding on staff numbers up to the grade of principal officer and for the provision of services and related matters to the Oireachtas. Second, the system for the allocation of budgets to the Oireachtas changed from the annual Civil Service Estimates and Vote procedure to a different process involving a three-year budget drawn from the Central Fund. The new budget is set every three years following engagement and negotiations with the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery, and Reform. The budget is approved at political level by the commission and by Government and Cabinet, and the amending legislation is passed by both Houses.",
                "Under the terms of the inaugural Act, a three-year budget covering the period 2004 to 2006 was provided. Further Acts were enacted in 2006, 2009, 2012, 2015, 2018 and 2021, also providing for a three-year budget for the relevant periods. A new Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Act is now required as a matter of priority as the financing provided under the 2021 Act will expire on 31 December. If this Bill is not enacted by the end of the year, there will be no statutory basis for any payments by the Oireachtas from 1 January 2025. That would mean there would be no authority for the payment of salaries of Members of both Houses, no authority for salaries for our support staff, no authority for the salaries of the permanent employees of the Houses and no authority for the payment of any service, contractual, obligatory or otherwise, in the service of our parliamentary system.",
                "As Deputies will be aware, the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission oversees the provision of services to the Houses and their Members by the commission Act. The primary functions are to provide for the running of the Houses of the Oireachtas to act as governing body of the service, to consider and determine policy in relation to the service and to oversee the implementation of that policy by the Secretary General. The commission is not responsible for the day-to-day management of the Houses. The Secretary General has overall responsibility for these functions. The commission does not set the level of remuneration payable to TDs and Senators. Responsibility for salaries, pensions and allowances is conferred on me in my role as the Minister for public expenditure. The commission is, however, accountable to the Parliament and presents annual reports on its work to both Houses together with Estimates and accounts of its annual expenditure.",
                "I acknowledge the valuable role played by secretarial, parliamentary and administrative assistants in supporting Members and delivering a high-quality service to the Oireachtas. As a Member of the Oireachtas for over 13 years, I am acutely conscious of the high-calibre work that all of our staff do. We are dependent on them and grateful for their work, and I am confident that I speak for all of us when I say that. In this context, I note that the scheme for secretarial assistants is the mechanism under which secretarial assistants and others are engaged. Under the scheme, the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission has the power to regulate the provision of secretarial facilities to Members and qualifying parties. Secretarial assistants, administrative assistants, parliamentary assistants, administrators and chefs de cabinet are employed by Members and by qualifying parties but are paid by the commission. The commission also regulates the number of staff employed under the scheme and has oversight of the operation of the scheme.",
                "Under the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Act 2003, the commission must obtain the consent of the Minister for public expenditure before reaching an agreement with any person in respect of pay, conditions of employment or superannuation rights. This means that the commission advises on matters and submits proposals to me, as the relevant Minister, for approval. In that regard, I was happy to be able to agree to proposals to settle a pay claim in 2022 that included a regrading of all secretarial assistants to administrative assistants and the realignment of scheme pay scales under the terms of Building Momentum. The terms of the agreement have been implemented by the Houses of the Oireachtas Service. I am glad that difficulties with recruitment and retention appear to have eased since the implementation of the agreement.",
                "The Houses of the Oireachtas Service is the public service body which administers the Houses of the Oireachtas on behalf of the commission as the governing authority. The functions of the service are set out in legislation and can be broadly summarised as the provision of professional advice and support to the commission, the Houses and their committees. We need a modern, fit-for-purpose, well-resourced parliamentary system. I believe the allocation provided for in this legislation, €565 million between 1 January 2025 and 31 December 2027, will meet that aim.",
                "My objective is to strike the right balance between sufficient and appropriate funding and showing by example in the management of this money our commitment to value for money. The funding envelope and the scale of the increase are broadly in line with the parameters agreed by the Government in the context of the budget. This figure comprises €205 million in 2025, with a balance of €360 million between 2026 and 2027. This is an increase of €102.25 million or 22.1% over a three-year period. Within the overall envelope, pay and pensions comprise €406.6 million, or 72% of the overall budget allocation. Members' allowances amount to €32.9 million. Non-pay expenditure comprises €125.5 million or 22% of the overall budget allocation.",
                "With respect to pay, a key driver of expenditure relates to the prospective increase in the size of the Dáil. The next Dáil will see 174 Deputies representing 43 Dáil constituencies, an increase of 14 from the current 160 representing 39 constituencies. This will have impacts in a number of other areas. For example, these Deputies will be entitled to allowances already in place. However, it is important to clarify that the allocation provided for the period of this Bill makes no provision for general increases in the rates associated with existing allowances.",
                "In order to safeguard Members and support the democratic process, in April I introduced an allowance in respect of security measures. The value and nature of the allowance was 50% or €5,000, whichever is the lesser, on a vouched basis. Following lower than expected take-up, the Members' service of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission has provided a revised proposal which I am currently reviewing. Any potential increase would need to be funded from the overall allocation proposed in this Bill. However, it is vital that we take reasonable steps to ensure that Members can safely go about their parliamentary business. I take this matter very much to heart and I will do what I can to assure Members that I will support them in the discharge of their parliamentary duties.",
                "Another key driver of the increased spending relates to the implementation of the Oireachtas ICT strategy. This is to provide for new initiatives and emerging requirements such as cybersecurity and artificial intelligence, Al. We cannot in any sphere of public business afford to be complacent about the security of our digital work in this Parliament. There are bad actors out there who seek to discredit our parliamentary democracy. We must not let our Parliament fall behind in the use and understanding of Al. The proposed allocation will contribute to the replacement of two legacy systems across both the corporate services area and the procedural area.",
                "Further contributory factors leading to the increase include costs associated with the forthcoming election and our forthcoming EU Presidency. We have a proud parliamentary tradition. A portion of the extra funding has been provided to support the ongoing work of parliamentary reform, for example with regard to Oireachtas committees.",
                "The Bill has two key sections. There is only one substantive amendment to the Bill. Section 1 amends section 5 of the principal Act to provide funding for expenditure incurred by the commission from 1 January 2025 for three years. The amount of that funding is €565 million. Section 2 is a standard provision that sets out the Short Title, collective citation and a commencement date for the Bill.",
                "This Bill provides for the proper and appropriate resourcing of our Parliament for our work. It seeks to get the right balance between adequately funding the Oireachtas and value for money. The work of the two Houses of the Oireachtas is central to the political and democratic development of our State and nation. I believe our future prosperity and welfare will make great demands on both the Dáil and the Seanad. We must equip ourselves for the mission entrusted to us by the Constitution and by the people.",
                "I commend this Bill to the House."

I understand the urgency of that. I take this opportunity to pay tribute and to thank the staff here in the Houses of the Oireachtas. We all know this place simply would not work without them. The exceptional nature of the work that is done here gives us pause to consider how inoperable this House would be but for the good work that is done, as well as the fair and unbiased way in which that work is done. I thank the staff. Many times I have sought assistance from committee staff and others who do a phenomenal job, often under pressure and in hours that certainly are not social. I acknowledge the co-ordination of the committees and the witnesses and all of the meetings that take place here and the due diligence taken around that.",

In terms of undertaking constituency work and representing the people of Mayo, I have used the parliamentary questions function almost on a daily basis, so I thank the staff who co-ordinate that function. I note that the audited accounts of the commission in the most recent annual report show the cost of running the Houses came in under budget. Thankfully, I have not had cause to seek support regarding personal safety and security here but I know this is also a key function undertaken by the commission. I commend the efforts taken to keep those in politics safe, particularly women, in order to encourage other women and other people to join the Oireachtas.",
                "I commend everybody who is going forward for election. It is important however, that no matter where people work, in whatever part of society, that they are safe where they work, not just in the Oireachtas but in retail and everything else. We have spoken many times here about resourcing An Garda Síochána and what needs to be done there.",
                "Since part of this Bill relates to the salaries of parliamentarians I would like to clarify that Sinn Féin's support for the Bill in no way constrains the next Government from reducing elected representatives' salaries. On that subject, as part of our alternative budget proposition under a Sinn Féin Government, the salary of the Taoiseach would be cut by €65,000. We would also reduce by 50% the salary top-ups to the Tánaiste, Cabinet Ministers and Ministers of State.",
                "I have not much more to say on the Bill other than we absolutely need to get value for money. We all know that. I am sure there are workers within the Oireachtas here who were as appalled as I was about the bike shelter built out the back for €336,000. We must have the correct controls in place and continuous evaluation of all this. We have to ensure that hard-earned taxpayers' money does not continue to be wasted.",

                "I support the Bill and recognise the need for the additional expenditure for the next three years, partly to reflect the increase in numbers here and the attendant costs that go with that. In what is possibly my last intervention in the House before I depart, I am glad to say that I was for a short time a member of the commission. I was grateful for the opportunity to see the inner workings.",
                "It is important to express our gratitude to the staff of these Houses of the Oireachtas. I feel that every staff member is motivated by a sense of public service and a deep sense of the institution that they are serving and the importance of that institution to the functioning of this democracy, which we do not take for granted in these times we live in.",
                "I personally want to express my gratitude to everybody I have met throughout these 17-odd years for the wonderful service they have given to me, the courtesy and kindness. I will take it with me in my next step.",
                "If I were to make a few short observations about the role of the commission, I respectfully suggest membership should be more reflective of the disparate political groupings here at present. Individual political parties in particular should not have to horse trade with each other for parcels of time spent on the commission. I also believe into the future there may be a role for ensuring how the commission works is communicated to each individual Member after each commission meeting. Unless someone is a member of the commission and, dare I say, experienced and well versed in the ways of this House, most Members possibly do not know exactly what the commission does. Up to this year, it had funding of €460 million and that will increase to €565 million. There is a role for increasing the manner in which the commission communicates to all Members of this House. Perhaps that could be taken on board.",
                "There has been a dramatic increase in the number of staff employed by the House. I have not seen a commensurate increase in the number of staff employed by individual Members. For instance, the allocation to individual TDs has stayed finite, similarly to Members of the Seanad. The workload of individual TDs - I can only speak for TDs - has increased dramatically in the past number of years but the allocation of staff members per TD has not. If the role of the commission is to serve the democratic function and serve the people who interface with this House, given the massive workloads TDs now have, there is a case to be made for rebalancing the staffing arrangements more in favour of those people who actually serve the public and to strike a balance in a way that is reflective of the workload of individual TDs. That could be looked at.",
                "I again thank the wonderful staff of this institution for their assistance and advice. They fed and watered me and gave me guidance. I am very grateful for that and for the professionalism of the staff who come into these Houses every day and assist us in our work. It is meaningful work. It is really appreciated. While I have these last few minutes, if I may, I thank the people of Cork East for the wonderful past four mandates they gave me. It has been the privilege of my life to have served in these Houses. One is sad to leave but one is hopeful that one has left a legacy of hard work and a dedication and respect for this institution, its rules and procedures. It is an important place. In these times when the political discourse has become diminished and sometimes degraded, it is important that we have an institution that serves the democratic function well for the vast majority of society who want to see these Houses of the Oireachtas function well and see their parliamentarians behave in a way that is decorous and in a way that is reflective of their expectations when they elect us. I again thank the people of Cork East for this incredible privilege, my family, friends, the people who campaigned for me down through the years and the people who worked with me in our office in Mallow. It has been an incredible privilege and I thank them."

                "I thank the Chair. With his indulgence, I might have a little bit more than three and a half minutes. Like the previous speaker, this will be my last opportunity to speak after 22 and a half years as Member of one of the Houses of the Oireachtas. I have no issue with the legislation in question. It is largely to do with ensuring the Oireachtas commission can function in the next three years in particular. I also pay tribute to the people who work in the Oireachtas, who have, as Deputy Sherlock said, fed, watered and supported us and gave us all sorts of advice over my time as a Member. Fantastic people work here, whether the secretariat of the committees or the cleaners - I used to have great gas with them when I was a younger, eager Member of the Oireachtas and came very early to my office and meet people you do not normally see during the working day. There are also the security, the ushers and people in the bars and restaurants who keep us on the straight and narrow as well. I also thank those who worked with me in my offices over the past 22 and a half years. My secretary, Frances, is in the Gallery. She joined me when Senators were first allowed to have people work in their constituency almost 20 years ago. I thank her, Pat Dunphy and Mary Ronan who was with me from the very start too, who have been in my office. I have been lucky to have them.",
                "I agree with Deputy Sherlock in that perhaps now it is time to look at the workload of Members of the Houses and as a consequence look for additional secretarial support. When we first came in here, the mobile phone was still a relatively new thing. It certainly was in 2002 when I started. I got my first one a couple of years before that. Now, it is hundreds of emails; often, in fairness, the delete button is a great thing. I use it not sparingly on many of the blanket emails we get. However, the public deserve a response too and all emails are not the ordinary cut and paste ones we get so many of every day. In order to respond to them, it might be time to look at additional supports for Members.",
                "I would be remiss in my last minute if I did not mention an issue that relates to the Oireachtas commission. In the past few weeks, I have had several members of my family and friends, people who campaigned with me over 25 years, visit the Oireachtas. The first thing they wanted to see was the bike shed, which says it all. How could a commission appointed by this House get the OPW to install a shed any tradesman could put in place for €20,000 or €30,000 at a cost of €336,000? People are right to ask questions about how public money is spent. That surely must be the job of the Oireachtas commission into the future as well to ensure there are no repeats."

During my long time here, I have always found them to be extremely helpful, supportive and courteous to me. They are an essential part of our democracy and we simply could not function without their conscientious contribution to the successful operation of these Houses.",
                "I want to concentrate on the Bill before us. I welcome the debate on the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission. However, it is deeply regrettable that this legislation is being rushed through the Oireachtas at the last minute without proper and robust parliamentary scrutiny. This Bill provides for a €565 million allocation to the commission over three years. That is over €100 million more than the previous allocation and represents a 22% increase. I accept that much of that has been as a result of improved pay and conditions, not least for the parliamentary staff because it was very much needed. The fact of the matter is that we have no real idea of how this money is to be spent over the next three years. There is no detail or no scrutiny of this at all. That is poor practice.",
                "I accept that the Dáil will expand also in the situation after the next election and with that, obviously, there will be additional costs but those costs should be teased out and if Members of this House were given the opportunity to carry out their oversight role properly, we would not be having this situation. We would be enabled to do our job properly by both the Minister and his Department. We should not be railroading this Bill through the Dáil and Seanad.",
                "We all know that this legislation needs to be passed before the current funding ends in December but we should never have been placed in this position. One would have to ask why is it that this is happening at the last minute.",
                "Throughout the Thirty-third Dáil, we have seen this Government show a flagrant disregard for proper parliamentary processes. In 2022, the European Commission even criticised the Government for this stating, \"discussions on new bills tend to be concentrated during short periods of time (in particular, during the two weeks before recesses), with negative consequences for proper parliamentary scrutiny\". This is a case in point before us today. This has been especially bad during the past few weeks. A looming election is no excuse for this abuse of the legislative process and that is what it is.",
                "In the aftermath of the bike shed debacle, it is particularly galling that this legislation is being rushed through. People were rightly outraged about this lavish spending. While the OPW does a lot of fine work, it needs to be far more concerned with value for money. This is public money and they should take proper care of it.",
                "Questions also need to be asked about the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission and its level of oversight and engagement. It is all well and good to haul the OPW before the commission after the fact but why was the commission not more curious in 2021 when the plans changed? At that time the new option brought forward by the OPW was agreed by the commission without any costings being presented or discussed. Essentially, a blank cheque was written and that is a serious failing. After all, this is public money we are dealing with and there needs to be proper care taken of it.",
                "The oversight role of the Minister's Department in public spending leaves a lot to be desired. I have commented on a number of occasions that his Department seems to have forgotten the fact that the \"R\" in the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform, DPER, stands for \"reform\" and we have seen precious little reform of spending by his Department. Indeed, I sometimes wonder what exactly is the role of DPER and why it is not combined back with the Department of Finance. After all, it was split for one purpose and one purpose only, which was to give an economic Ministry to a party in a coalition government and that practice has continued, unfortunately, since then. There should be a special unit to provide oversight of all public spending. That does not exist at the moment. The fact that we have the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts is sometimes referred to but, again, that is after the event. Any major project that is being proposed that involves public money should be seriously scrutinised in advance of that. We do not have that kind of process at the moment to any serious extent.",
                "On the subject of greater oversight, I would also like to take this opportunity to raise some related matters. It has come to my attention that there has been some abuse of the parliamentary privileges that Members enjoy here. For example, I want to raise the prepaid post facility we have. That needs to be reviewed and the allocation is obviously no longer relevant to the extent that it had been previously because of the widespread use of email.",
                "The other example of that is that there are certain examples where that freepost is being used for electoral purposes and that should never be the case. I have myself witnessed \"Vote No. 1\" leaflets going out in recent times in prepaid envelopes and that should not happen. Using prepaid Oireachtas envelopes to campaign is clearly against the rules because it should be declared as an election expense. However, these rules continue to be flouted. This again is a misuse of public moneys and it must be tackled in a serious way if people are to have trust in politicians. It gives officeholders an unfair advantage in election campaigns and these unincurred costs should be repaid.",
                "I read the annual report of the Oireachtas commission and the only reference to postal management seemed to be in respect of scrutiny. That is insufficient. There is a need for a thorough review of the use of that.",
                "Another issue I would like to raise is that of access to Leinster House by former Members. I have raised this on a number of occasions in recent years. As I understand it, this protocol is under the purview of the commission and it needs urgent review. There would seem to be a revolving door between politics and private sector lobbying. We have seen umpteen examples of former Members of this House, Senators and Ministers, moving seamlessly from the political arena into the private sector in what are known as lobbying and public engagement companies, who are really lobbyists under a different name. Very significant ethical issues arise in circumstances like that. This practice of ex-Members involved in lobbying being facilitated by their perpetual access to the Leinster House complex needs to be tackled. It is not right.",
                "This has allowed an insidious situation to develop whereby several former Ministers, Deputies and Senators move seamlessly between politics and lobbying. They use the privilege of admission to the complex to gain undue access to sitting Ministers and other influential Members of these Houses. This is especially the case with ex-government TDs and Ministers, who are frequently seen swanning around the corridors of this complex. In recent years, there have been several high-profile examples of TDs and Ministers moving between politics and public affairs or lobbying roles, and in some cases looking to move back into politics again. The Minister will be familiar with that. This is wrong. There needs to be a very clear demarcation between politics and lobbying. Access to Leinster House is a privilege that should not be taken away lightly, but once an ex-Member of this House becomes a lobbyist they should forfeit their right of access to it. It is really important this issue is taken up. I regret it was not taken up in a serious way in this Dáil, despite I and my party colleagues raising it several times. It brings politics into disrepute and I urge the Minister, and certainly his successor, to take this issue on because it is not doing anybody any service."

                "I join in the thanks for all the staff in the House here. I will not start listing the different groups of people who have been so helpful over all the years. They have not only been helpful, but have become good friends of all of us and have been so kind to all the visitors we have brought in and so accommodating to everybody. It is something that makes Leinster House a great place to work and somewhere it is always a pleasure to come to. I do not know whether it has ever happened to the Minister, as a TD, that somebody calls or emails requesting he get one of his team to do something, like look at his diary or check something. Did he look to his left and then his right and see that aside from him there are two on the team? What I have noticed in politics is everything has got more complicated. The whole world has got complicated. Bureaucracy has gone mad. Forms are much more difficult. Lots of people are having lots more difficulty interacting with the State. You cannot get anybody on the phone. They come in desperation to people like Deputies to try to sort their problems out and the service they rightly seek should be of a high quality. Some people will say that is not the job of the TD, but I do not know who is meant to do it. My experience was that I learned so much about the flaws in the system, whether it was forms that were badly designed or policies that have a ridiculous result. It is only when you go to the coalface that you see what ordinary people encounter every day in the system. I brought many of the ideas I have learned from doing my constituency work when I had the great opportunity of being a Minister. My last act here was to be rapporteur on a committee that looked at the whole issue of means testing, which is a huge issue for people in the west and all over the country. Many people are subject to means tests.",
                "It is absolutely vital – and I can say this going out the door – that there is adequate resourcing of Teachtaí Dála. Democracy all over the world is under challenge. There are lots of people who think it is an unnecessary expense. There is a lot of commentary to that effect. Democracy is the bulwark of stability and is incredibly important to where we find ourselves as a nation in terms of the progress we have made and we must be willing to pay for it. Let the people who do not agree stand up and say they do not, but the vast majority of people agree and want the service.",
                "If the Cathaoirleach Gníomhach will indulge me for one more minute, years ago when I was a Minister a lady rang me and was giving out that I had staff in my constituency office. I noticed the call came from Dublin. I let her off for a while and then asked her whether she would have been mad at me if nobody had answered the phone. I said this was my constituency office, whereas she was from Dublin. She said she supposed she would, started laughing and then apologised saying she accepted that. TDs’ offices are public offices that are accessed by people from all over the place and we should be fearless in funding them. The time to do it is after this election. We should ensure every Member has three staff at least. It is not fair to have one staff member on their own in a constituency office. That is a bad practice. We should all have a member of staff up here. I can say that while going out the door because I will never benefit if that comes in, but it is time we faced the work burden of TDs and did something practical about it. That is one small suggestion. There are other reforms I would like to see, but that is one I put on the agenda here in what might be my last or second last speech in the Dáil. Go raibh míle maith agat, a Chathaoirligh."

In other words, if you want to bake a cake, you have to have all the ingredients. That is why the Government has failed to represent the country as a whole. It has represented some sectors but has forgotten about the hospitality sector. Cutting the VAT rate for hospitality to 9% would have saved jobs and businesses. The Government is giving grants to new businesses that are opening up but they only last two years and then close down. The businesses that have been operating for 20 or 30 years cannot get supports from the Government to keep them in business. The Government gives supports to new businesses to open up and says there has never been so many businesses, but those businesses then close down after two years because they realise that without Government assistance, they cannot stay open.

When the Government tried to accommodate them around the country it found out there was no proper infrastructure in place outside Dublin and the major cities. That is where the failure of the Government has come from. The Government does not reflect the country as a whole and has forgotten about rural Ireland from the Red Cow outwards. It has forgotten the basics that communities, small businesses, agriculture, farming and transport deliver. The Government has forgotten to invest in rural Ireland. If you invest in small things in rural Ireland, they will invest in you because they are self-sufficient. They will not give out. All we ask is that the Government give rural Ireland the basic infrastructure it is giving to other people.",

Is ceist thábhacht í toisc go bhfuil airgead i gceist chun a dhéanamh cinnte de go bhfuil an Teach seo ag obair. Gan an t-airgead nó an infheistíocht sin, tá dainséar ann. Cosnaíonn daonlathas airgead; tá sé chomh simplí leis sin. Tá daoine amuigh ansin agus b’fhearr leo nach mbeadh muid anseo. B’fhearr leo nach mbeadh an Dáil ann agus nach mbeadh muid ag caitheamh airgid. Tá sé tábhachtach i gcónaí go smaoinímid air seo. Caithfimid ár jab a dhéanamh agus gan an fhoireann iontach atá istigh anseo bheadh sé i bhfad Éireann níos deacra. Luaim an fhoireann, lucht an ceaintín, na ushers - is féidir liom dul tríd an liosta ar fad - agus an fhoireann atá againn inár n-oifigí féin atá ag cuidiú lá i ndiaidh lae leis an bpobal. Déanann roinnt daoine dearmad air sin nuair atá siad ár n-ionsaigh. Tapóidh mé an deis chun an t-ionsaí a rinneadh ar an Aire, an Teachta Roderic O’Gorman, an tseachtain seo chaite a cháineadh. Ní hé sin an bealach le polaitíocht nó plé a bheith ann. Ba chóir go mbeadh muid in ann dul timpeall le linn toghcháin agus stocaireacht a dhéanamh agus labhairt le daoine. Níor chóir go mbeadh daoine ag déanamh na hionsaithe atá ag tarlú rómhinic anois le cúpla bliain anuas. Más daonlathas atá ann, tá cead againn labhairt agus díospóireacht a bheith againn. Ba chóir go mbeadh cead againn a bheith gafa sa toghchán mar atá roinnt dóibh siúd atá ag tabhairt tacaíochta dóibh siúd atá ag déanamh ionsaithe, ní hamháin ar líne ach ionsaithe fisiciúil ar Theachtaí nó Airí san áit seo.",

That is really important for us, as Members, when we are dealing with tricky, difficult and complex personal situations for our constituents, as well as wider societal issues.",
                "I commend the staff on their efforts. One particular instance I will not forget is when I brought Baby Collins Montaine into the Chamber. The ushers were so helpful on that occasion. Not only do they make the experience in the Houses of the Oireachtas easier, in some ways they are also a familiar face on which we can depend every day. I extend my gracious thanks to each and every one of them for the time I have been here. I also commend my constituency staff in my office, Sinead Perez and Kathleen Coll. They have been impeccable and a pillar of strength for me as a public representative. I wanted to take time to mention the work that goes on behind the scenes. It keeps everything we see on the television working and keeps us all in line. Gabhaim buíochas leo go léir."

I will pick up on a couple of points made. Every speaker who contributed to the debate offered support for the Bill and I thank them very much for doing so.",
                "I will respond to comments made by Deputy Róisín Shortall who referred to the Bill being rushed. It is indeed the case that I am hoping to complete all Stages this afternoon, with the co-operation of the House. I emphasise that the Bill is a consequence of engagement that has already taken place between the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission and my Department. It did not emerge from a vacuum. The figures in the Bill and the rationale for them are the consequence of a process that has taken place between my Department and the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission. The proposed costs have a very solid rationale and justification.",
                "This leads to my second point, namely, our recognition and acknowledgement that our work involves an expense. Anyone who has the privilege of serving as a Member of this House spends much of his or her time dealing with complex situations, either on behalf of constituents or, if he or she is privileged to hold office in any way, on behalf of the country. As all speakers commented, we rely so much on our staff either here in Leinster House or in our constituency offices to support us in the discharge of our duties. I listened to the comments made regarding the need for further assistance and resources in the delivery of constituency work in particular. In the context of the support that will be needed in the next Oireachtas and Bills similar to this one that will follow, I accept this is an issue that will require further consideration. As it stands, the level of support and resources available to TDs and Senators is appropriate but I am also aware that the demands many of them are facing, particularly those who represent constituencies further away from Leinster House, are acute and considerable. My Department will certainly consider the issues the Deputies raised in future. These matters also need to be considered by the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, on which there are representatives from all parties and none. These are the kinds of issues I hope can be further discussed when the next Dáil is formed.",
                "I add to those of other speakers my own thanks to those with whom I have worked in the Oireachtas. I hope to have the opportunity to work with them again in the future. Obviously, that is dependent on the people of Dublin Central. Everyone spoke with great warmth about the support that is made available to us in this House, not only by our staff on whom we depend most but also by everyone else who works here, from our colleagues who support the Houses of the Oireachtas, to the ushers and those who look after the facilities. It is appropriate their work has been recognised by all who have spoken.",
                "As for other matters related to the Bill, a further allocation for our work over the next three years is proposed. Much of that additional cost is driven by the fact that the next Dáil will be bigger, with more TDs and constituencies represented in it. The funding envelope also provides for investment in IT that will be needed to make our work more efficient and safer.",
                "On that note, I acknowledge the TDs who have spoken for whom this afternoon could be the final time they speak in Dáil Éireann. I thank them for their great service to their constituents and for the way in which they have represented their constituents on many matters over very distinguished careers. I commend the Bill to the House."

                "I move: \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"",
                "I am pleased to introduce the Appropriation Bill 2024 to the House. It is critical annual financial legislation. It has to be enacted before the end of the year to give effect to the authorisation of voted expenditure throughout 2024 and to allow for the continuation of expenditure into 2025. It has two main functions. The first is to provide legal authorisation for all of the expenditure that has occurred in 2024, on the basis of the Estimates voted on by the Dáil over the year. These allocations are known as the amounts to be appropriated for supply services. They are set out in section 1 and Schedule 1 to the Bill. These relate to the Revised Estimates, Further Revised Estimates and Supplementary Estimates that have been agreed by the Dáil over the course of the 2024. In net terms, these amount to €86.5 billion. In gross terms, and taking into account expenditure on the Social Insurance Fund and the National Training Fund, total gross voted expenditure allocated for this year is €104.3 billion. This reflects the Government’s sustainable investment in public services and a balanced and budgetary approach that will support households and firms, deliver improvements in public services, boost the resilience of the economy and further enhance the capital stock, including, most importantly, homes.",
                "Our social protection system seeks to provide an effective social safety net for the more vulnerable members of society. The 2024 gross expenditure allocation for social protection, including spending on the Social Insurance Fund, is over €27 billion. This helped to improve our social welfare system. It delivered a €12 increase in core weekly rates and increased the income of an estimated 1.45 million recipients. It delivered increases to the qualified child payment and working family payment income thresholds and to the domiciliary care allowance rate and other important measures.",
                "Investment in the Irish health service has also delivered better outcomes for our citizens. Ireland now performs well on treatable and preventable causes of mortality and has made significant improvements over the past decade, including reductions in the mortality rate for all cancers. We have had the highest proportion of a population reporting good or very good health among all EU countries as of 2022. The number of people on waiting lists for outpatient care has fallen since 2021 and there have been significant improvements in the average waiting time of patients.",
                "Housing has also seen a considerable increase. In 2023, 11,938 new social homes were delivered. It is expected that this delivery will continue to grow in 2024 and grow in future years as the delivery pipeline continues to increase. A sum of €8.3 billion in funding is being provided this year for the housing, local government and heritage Vote group, including €4.9 billion in capital funding.",
                "Education funding in 2024 saw the provision of an appropriate school place to over 970,000 students in primary, post-primary and special schools around the country, with a record number of teachers, almost 77,000, employed by the Department of Education. Close to 1,200 new teachers were employed in September 2024 for the commencement of the 2024-25 school year. Education capital expenditure in 2024 is supporting the continued progression of the 350 building projects currently at construction, while also facilitating close to 90 school building projects that are to proceed from tender stage to construction over the course of 2024 and early next year.",
                "Funding has also enabled a range of other schemes and initiatives across government. In transport, the continuation of fare initiatives has helped with cost of living. There has been further investment in greenways and active travel. In further and higher education, we continue to invest in our apprenticeship programme, which is delivering 16,000 places this year. Provision to support childcare providers through the core funding scheme has ensured that fees for parents using these services have remained frozen, while the subsidies through the national childcare scheme have continued to increase. Over 200,000 children have benefited from the national childcare scheme to date this year, with out-of-pocket costs for parents having fallen by up to 50% for users of full-time early learning and childcare. The NCS subsidies are worth up to €5,000 per child in 2024.",
                "A balanced approach to public service pay was achieved in the public service agreement for the period to 2026. The funding outlined in the Appropriation Bill reflects the Government’s continued commitment to responding to challenges as they arise. Of course, one of the greatest challenges we have experienced recently is the impact of inflation on living standards. I am conscious that so many are still worried about heating and lighting their homes this winter. We have a further package of cost-of-living supports in this budget. The 2024 cost of this package of €2 billion of progressive supports for households and businesses, including two €125 energy credits, is reflected and included in this Bill.",
                "The second principal function of the Appropriation Bill is to provide a legal basis for expenditure to continue into next year. As set out in the Central Fund (Permanent Provisions) Act 1965, the authority for spending in 2025, prior to the agreement of the 2025 Estimates by the Dáil, is based on the amounts included in the 2024 Appropriation Bill. For this reason, it is essential that this Bill be enacted before the end of 2024. Should that not happen, there would be no authority to spend any voted moneys from the start of January 2025 until the approval of the 2025 Estimates.",
                "To account for the complexity of very big projects, we now have multi-annual capital envelopes in place. This allows for the carryover of up to 10% of unspent voted capital.",
                "Schedule 2 to the Bill sets out the proposed capital expenditure amounts that are to be carried forward to 2025 by Vote. This stands at €207.21 million, which is 1.6% of the total 2024 gross voted Revised Estimates capital allocation of just over €13 billion. The carryover figure is on a downward trend and is much lower than the carryover amounts requested by Departments in recent years. It reflects our increasing ability to spend our full capital budget in any given year for which it is allocated.",
                "As in previous years, the Bill includes a provision for repayable advances from the Central Fund to the Paymaster General’s supply account in order to meet certain 2025 Exchequer liabilities due for payment over the first week of January.",
                "The provision for these advances is critical as the banking system will be closed on Wednesday, 1 January. This means it is necessary for the funding to be in place in departmental bank accounts before the end of this year in order to meet those liabilities on a timely basis.",
                "The Bill also provides for prefunding certain payments under Social Welfare Acts due between 1 and 6 January 2025 that are made on an agency basis by An Post. The advances provision in the Bill ensures that these payments can be transferred from the Department of Social Protection to the network of An Post offices throughout the country. Section 3 provides for up to €900 million to be advanced from the Central Fund to meet these requirements. This is a higher amount than in recent years due to payroll dates accruing in early 2025. This is technical, and any advances needed would then be repaid to the Central Fund next January.",
                "This Bill is an essential element of housekeeping undertaken by the Dáil each year. It will authorise in law all of the expenditure that has taken place in 2024 on the basis of the Estimates voted on by the Dáil over the course of this year. It also provides authority for voted expenditure to continue in the period between the beginning of January 2025 and when the Dáil approves the 2025 Estimates. This is to ensure continued funding for the delivery of front-line public services, investing in health and education services, social protection payments, funding An Garda Síochána and so forth. It reflects the continuation of a planned approach to public spending. I commend the Bill to the House."

                "Every year, I try to speak on the Appropriation Bill, which is usually taken in the run-up to Christmas week. With the election pending, this Bill has obviously been brought forward. Every year, the Minister's statement makes the same omission. He said the appropriation is based on the Estimates voted on during the year. There is one Estimate which I do not recall ever being voted on in the way the other Estimates are. It does not come before any committee but appears in the budget expenditure report. The Minister will know which one it is. It is Vote 15 - Secret Service. It is not a big sum of money in the context of what we are discussing and it is not enough to delay. It appears as a separate subhead and even though the Minister tried to be helpful last year and other Ministers have tried to be helpful in other years, it still has not been allocated to a Department. If it was allocated to a Department as part of a group of Estimates, so be it. Does it fit in with the Department of Defence? No, because it sits on its own. Does it fit in with the Department of Finance to maybe stop cybercrime? No. Does it sit with the Department of Justice? No. The secret service Vote in this Dáil and in previous Dáileanna sits on its own. It had a different number previously. It was Vote 15 in recent years and I cannot remember what number it was before that.",
                "This anomaly needs to be addressed. It is obviously not going to be addressed in this Dáil but it should be addressed in a future Dáil, in that the Minister should just allocate it to where it is appropriate. I have never sought information on the exact amount of funding. It is a small amount of money. If it goes to the area on which people say, on the quiet, it is spent on, then so be it. If it is the amount that is spent on securing and protecting the services of the State in the way other countries do that, it is a minuscule amount. It is not about the funding. The figure was even lower and has stayed constant for the past ten years in my memory.",
                "People have laughed at this and said, \"Oh yeah, the secret service\", and I have sometimes been quite flippant about it but there is no secret service. It is not like we are in Britain, where MI5 is answerable to a committee of Parliament in some ways. We do not have that mechanism but maybe we should have it. That has been a discussion in the background in the Dáil in recent years, especially with regard to cybercrime and so on. Maybe there is a need for greater disaster planning and planning for how to tackle what we saw when the HSE computers went down. If that is what is meant here, then so be it.",
                "The only thing I could find is Ireland's Secret Service in England. I have a copy of the book here. It is from 1924. It does not address a secret service organisation. Edward Brady wrote the book, which is about activities engaged in Britain from 1919 to 1921 by those who were acting under the authority of Michael Collins. I do not know whether that organisation continued. As far as I know, the IRB disappeared. There is no secret service, to my knowledge. There is an organisation within the Defence Forces, J2, which comes under the Defence Forces Vote and deals with intelligence. It is not a secret service. It is open and answerable to the military authorities, as are those within An Garda Síochána who are involved in the area of surveillance.",

If the Bill were not enacted, the Departments could not spend. The Bill also allows for capital carryover as per the Finance Act 2004. Each Department can carry over 10% of its capital allocation to the next year.",
                "The key to this Appropriation Bill is that it is a constitutional requirement and is essential to ensure that the Departments can spend come January. For this reason, we will be supporting it. The Bill used to be waved through the Dáil without debate. It is important that this is no longer the case. Obviously, everything is rushed because we are to have an election, so there is not much time for discussion. If anything, this House needs greater scrutiny of the budget and spending. People at home have had their eyes opened about this Government's approach to spending their money. The Government cannot properly manage to construct a bike shed or a security hut for a reasonable price. I do not need to remind anyone of the wholesale mismanagement of the national children's hospital.",
                "Capital investment is key not only in dealing with the major cracks in public infrastructure but is also a key driver with regard to job creation and regional development. The public needs housing, healthcare, community centres, flood defences, roads and critical infrastructure. In Mayo, the chronic shortage of housing is the number one reason that constituents contact my office. There are simply not enough social and affordable homes being built and the Government knows this. Housing need is rising across the State continuously.",
                "We also need investment in Knock Airport and our rural roads. For this reason, it is astonishing, as people will see, that €129 million is being carried over to next year that was unspent this year. We also have the western rail corridor that needs to be started immediately. Without this vital infrastructure, we cannot fulfil our true potential along the western corridor and the Atlantic economic corridor. Additionally, the ports and harbours in Mayo are in need of investment. I recently raised the situation at Porteen Harbour with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine.",
                "With regard to the €31 million unspent in agriculture, the debacle around the agri-climate rural environment scheme, ACRES, the scoring and not having the information that is needed for farmers is such a deterrent to farmers engaging in the climate change actions they need to do. I have followed all of the schemes, from rural environment protection scheme, REPS, 4 and the agri-environment options scheme, AEOS, to the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, and ACRES. One after the other, these schemes have been a diminution of what they are supposed to do with regard to facilitating farmers to farm in a climate-friendly way. It is an absolute failure of the Government, particularly with regard to ACRES. There is no way that any other sector would have to go through what farmers have to go through in order to get the payments they are entitled to.",
                "I turn to education and the carryover there. The school estate is also in need of attention. Earlier today, we had visitors from the Castlebar Educate Together school in the House. It was promised a new school building two years ago, but nothing has happened since. In fact, it is not two years ago, it goes back further. I talked to sixth-class students today who have been promised a new school since they started, and it still has not happened. They are still operating across three locations in Castlebar. That is an absolute headache for families with multiple children attending the school, particularly where there is a child with special needs, and they cannot be schooled together with their sibling. It is unfair on these children that a proper school identity cannot evolve with different children being educated in multiple different unsuitable locations. Castlebar primary school was also in touch with my office regarding a playing field that is required. St. Gerald's College in Castlebar regularly has to close its gym because of leaks in the roof. There are no excuses for it when we are dealing with so much money here. There is no excuse that so many places are left behind. We find in County Mayo and the west that many places are left behind. It is not right. We need positive discrimination if anything for infrastructure that needs to be done in the west to fulfil our potential and move from the disadvantaged position we are in. There is no shortage of need for capital investment from the Government. I ask the Minister to ensure this is where Government funding goes, instead of to projects that people did not want or ask for.",

I express my sincere thanks to the voters of Dublin North-West who placed their trust in me and voted for me over a period of 32 years. I will say that I am exceptionally grateful to them for doing that, and I have been honoured to represent the people of Dublin North-West throughout those many years. I also put on record my appreciation and thanks to my staff, Jake Ryan, Paul Mulville and Ryan Kelly, and to others through the years who have provided exceptional support to me, and without whose support I would not have been able to do this job. I thank all of them.",
                "I turn to the legislation before us. To a large extent this is a box-ticking exercise. It is yet again a situation where there really is not any scrutiny of the legislation we are required to support or get through this House. I will spend my short time dealing with one particular area where there is a huge underspend, as detailed in the Bill. This year, almost €130 million has been deferred to next year by the Department of Transport. This accounts for approximately 60% of the total deferred surrenders. It is a huge amount of money. Year after year, the Department has one of the highest underspends despite the urgent need to progress public transport projects. The Minister, who along with me represents the northside of Dublin, will be only too aware of the need for investment in public transport and we have waited a very long time.",
                "This situation is completely indefensible. How can we expect to meet our climate goals without a major acceleration of public transport projects? Under successive Governments, one abandoned or delayed public transport project has followed another. We may now have a Government that says all the right things on public transport infrastructure, but we still do not have one capable of delivering those projects. It is 24 years since the Dublin metro was first proposed and we are still at least a decade away from this project being delivered, and that is in a best-case scenario. This project was first proposed in 2000, with a target for delivery of 2010. Had it been delivered it would be turning a profit by now, but at the end of 2024 it still has not even been granted planning. I accept that Transport Infrastructure Ireland also has questions to answer when it comes to this delay. It is not just the Government. TII, after all, arrived at the oral hearing with 200 previously unseen documents, meaning public consultation had to be reopened after the public hearing. The repeated failure to deliver MetroLink has made communities on the northside of Dublin, such as the ones I represent in Dublin North-West, understandably sceptical that this project will ever be delivered. They have been seriously let down time and again. Dublin North-West is the only constituency in the greater Dublin area without any rail service at all, and there are many constituencies, principally on the southside, that have good bus, Luas and DART services. In Dublin North-West we are entirely dependent on buses.",
                "In that regard, the Minister will also be aware of the particular concerns currently in his constituency and mine with regard to the withdrawal of the 11 bus service. Residents in Wadelai, Hillcrest and Glasnevin are to lose a vital service with the removal of the 11 service next month, under what I regard as an ill-judged plan by the NTA. The 19 service is set to replace the 11 service but it will be a far inferior service to the existing one. When the 19 service is introduced, local residents will be required to change buses to continue south of the city and further afield, including a lot of elderly people and those with mobility issues. In Dublin North-West we have approximately twice as many people aged over 65 as the rest of the city. This decision shows no regard for the profile of the local area or its needs. This decision needs to be reversed and, at a minimum, the northside leg of the 11 service must be retained for the next two years, as the southside leg is being retained. If we want people to use public transport more in our city, we should be scaling up services, not cutting back on them. We all agree with the principles underpinning the BusConnects project, but we need to bring communities with us. The only way to create the buy-in needed is to make BusConnects a success. It will only be a success if it meets local needs. The NTA must reverse this decision and begin engaging meaningfully with the local community and its concerns.",
                "On the subject of public transport provision, Dublin North-West has also been repeatedly failed in respect of light rail services. When the Luas was first proposed many years ago it included a line to Ballymun, but regrettably that part of the plan was abandoned. There were to be three lines, including one to Ballymun. The extraordinary justification at the time was that not enough people drove cars in the area and the aim of the Luas was to reduce the number of cars on the road. How discriminatory can you get? Such a narrow criterion for inclusion was desperately short-sighted but unsurprising. This part of north Dublin has been neglected for decades and denied access to good-quality public services and the mobility necessary for full participation in social, cultural and economic life. The justification that MetroLink will provide that connectivity rings pretty hollow locally now, given how long this project has been promised, and yet is still undelivered. I have been involved in the consultation relating to the current iteration of MetroLink and have put out leaflets and information about it locally, but it is the third iteration and consultation that local residents have been involved in. You cannot blame them for being sceptical about this ever being delivered and the inability of successive Governments to think big and deliver large-scale transport projects.",
                "It is welcome that the Finglas Luas has finally been approved by the Cabinet, but its delivery must be prioritised to address years of underinvestment in sustainable, high-capacity transport solutions for our area. I fear that this recent announcement may be little more than a cynical election ploy. I sincerely hope that is not the case and that there is real political will to get this project over the line. However, experience would suggest otherwise. I was clearing out my office and came across some ten-year-old leaflets. The Finglas Luas was promised then and we are still waiting. It is now more than four years since the first public consultation on this project and the delivery date has already been pushed out from 2028 to 2031 and that is at the earliest. Is it any wonder people have lost faith in the State's ability to deliver these major public transport projects?",
                "It must also be said that the planned route for the Finglas Luas has one glaring omission. There is an opportunity to interchange with the proposed MetroLink route. Instead of continuing the Finglas Luas to Ballymun where the MetroLink is set to stop, the current proposal terminates at Charlestown. That does not make any sense at all. Why is the scope of the project so limited? Linking the Luas and the metro at Ballymun would provide unparalleled connectivity with the airport, not only for Finglas, but the greater Dublin area. Why is it that the northside of Dublin is only getting an additional four stops? One only has to look at the length of the existing green line on the south side to see there is a clear imbalance. There is an urgent need to address the poor public transport provision on the northside of Dublin. That is why the Department of Transport's repeated underspends must be called out. Not only should these important projects be viewed as a long-term public good, they are also critical to our transition to a carbon neutral society. They have the ability to be transformative socially, environmentally and economically, but they have to be more than plans. They have to be realised. The next government must show some ambition and prioritise delivery of these essential public transport projects, because what has been missing is not a commitment to these projects, but a commitment to actually delivering them. We have not seen the political will to do that to date unfortunately."

Both parts of this project have in recent years been subject to uncertainty. Tipperary County Council has been forced to write to the Department expressing concern at this.",
                "In recent weeks, I attended the design update for the Limerick Junction to Cahir project, but it is again subject to the uncertainty of the funding regime and sponsors of the project have to beg for money each time. This is an important project. It is important for road safety along the N24 and along its route, the interests of specific towns and villages are intertwined with it. I was told that certain parts of the project could be considered as stand-alone and could be fast-tracked if the money were available. However, without funding, the elements that could provide the most immediate relief are beyond us. With this in mind and the intolerable traffic situation in Tipperary town and the effect it has on civil life, business and tourism, this funding uncertainty must end.",
                "Funding issues are also faced on the Cahir to Waterford part of the project, slowing down progress and raising questions about the Minister's commitment to the south east as well as the mid-west. Today, a meeting of the Carrick-on-Suir and Waterford councils took place. There are serious concerns about this project. Huge money has been spent to complete stage 2 but stage 3 is stalled because of a lack of funding. There was cross-party support for stage 3 to be funded and completed as soon as possible and the money that has been spent so far will be wasted. The N24, when finished, will connect Limerick on the west coast to the east in Waterford and will be of huge benefit to all the regions in this corridor. People need to be put first and that must apply to any future sequencing of projects such as this one."

                "In some ways, this is a formality we go through at the end of each year. As I understand it, it is the final authorisation of the expenditure of money throughout the year and of money that will be carried over that has not been spent. It is an opportunity to dwell a little bit on the issue of the expenditure of the enormous amount of public money totalling €86 billion. It is the public's money and it is an extraordinary fact, with this record level of expenditure, we can still be in a situation where we have more than 100,000 people on housing waiting lists, huge numbers of people are not eligible to be on social housing waiting lists because their income is too high, but they also cannot access affordable housing, almost 1 million people are on hospital waiting lists, people are crowded on trolleys in our public health service and 110,000 children with special needs are waiting for therapies and services. Vulnerable children who need those services are waiting years. I could go on about the failure to deliver for many people with this enormous amount of money on basics such as housing, health and services for vulnerable children with special needs and those with disabilities. Some of that is about having to spend more money, but some of it has to be questioned. Are we getting the best value for the money we are spending?",
                "I certainly want to take this opportunity to make a point to the Minister and to anyone serious about trying to address some of those big problems. The Government produced a report about construction costs - I think it was done by people in the Housing Agency - which came out at the end of September. The Minister may be familiar with it. It made for sober reading in that it showed that currently a semi-detached house on an estate is being delivered at €450,000 for a new build, apartments at €550,000 and suburban apartments at €590,000. That is a high price for something we absolutely need but it is clearly unaffordable for a huge number of the people who need the housing. That is a demonstration of significant market failure and the inability of the market to deliver housing at an affordable level. This is relevant to the expenditure of public money because a huge volume of the housing the State has delivered has been purchased from private builders. To address an existential and urgent housing crisis, I have actively campaigned for the State to do that. It should buy houses when it has not built them. I would prefer if it were building them in the numbers necessary, but I am in favour of us buying them to make up the deficit because we need social and affordable housing. However, it should be obvious that we could be getting a lot more social and affordable housing if we could deliver the houses more cheaply than the private market is capable of delivering them. That is why there is a serious - I am convinced of this and I would like to convince this House and whatever Government comes in - need for a State construction company and it could deliver housing more cheaply. Why? Even the biggest builders in the country do not have the scale necessary to deliver the sort of housing output the Government now accepts we have to get to. It is double the number Housing for All originally proposed, 50,000, 60,000 or perhaps 70,000 houses per year.",
                "Even if the private sector wants to or were able to, it clearly does not have the capacity. Between them, Cairn and Glenveagh deliver 2,500 houses in a year. They are the biggest builders, with approximately 350 people working for them, but they are just not big enough. They do not have the scale to do what is necessary and they are clearly not able to deliver the houses at affordable prices, even for the State or for individual buyers.",
                "What we need is to have a company of scale that controls the land bank so that it is not subject to speculation. When we break down the construction cost of housing, a very large part of the cost relates to land. The study I mentioned estimates about €70,000 of the enormous cost is for land. Much of that is because of the speculation by private developers who own the land bank, who flip it and so on. We must strip out that. The report also estimates that about €40,000 of the price relates to the profit margin of the developer. It also adds in a significant cost for the cost of finance, in other words, the profits of the banks. We can also add in sales and marketing. Consultants are often brought in who charge large amounts of money to do the sales and marketing for these developments.",
                "We can strip out all of those things and get the economies of scale that a construction company the size of the ESB, which has 8,000 workers, can provide. State enterprises can work. The ESB is a world-beating company. It charges too much for its electricity, but that is because of deregulation. Historically, it has been a success story of State enterprise. We should have a State construction company on the scale of the ESB building on a not-for-profit basis, with a land bank and its own construction capacity. We could slash the cost of housing and consequently get more housing for the billions that are being spent in order to deliver the housing we need. The Government should seriously think about that. We electrified and transformed this country with the ESB, a State not-for-profit enterprise, and we must do the same in order to build social and affordable homes as well as for the necessary retrofitting of homes and to put in place necessary water infrastructure.",
                "In my area - this is replicated all over the country - there are sites on zoned land in public ownership in Old Connaught in Rathmichael where they have not even put in the water infrastructure yet. This is happening everywhere else too. It is absolutely insane. We must have the capacity to do this. We could do it cheaply and with the urgency and focus that is required if we had some control over the land bank and when and what we build.",
                "That is my pitch for a State construction company. We will be very actively campaigning on that because we think we cannot solve the housing crisis unless we begin to move in that direction because we are facing massive market failure when it comes to housing. It must be capable of delivering the numbers required and at the right price. Even if the market delivers housing, the price is just too high and there is no sign that it is going to come down.",
                "There are a few last points I want to make. There was an overrun in sports of €24 million not spent. This year we had a fantastic run-out in sports, especially at the Olympics. In my area, the whole borough is full of pride for Jack Marley, who fought in the Olympics in the heavyweight division and got to the quarter finals. A young woman, Robin O'Reilly, got to the European championships in boxing also. We have had a fantastic level of new involvement in sports - in soccer and GAA. There is a fantastic growth in young people getting involved in sports, in particular young women. Every single club I know is crying out for all-weather pitches, clubhouses and basic facilities. There are just not enough of them. While there have been some new facilities, they are not nearly on the scale necessary to meet the demand of young people. Sport is important. When we look at the success in the Olympics and in the Paralympics, we can see what our young people can achieve if we provide them with the facilities. It might help the Irish soccer team improve its fortunes if at a grassroots level we proactively put money into providing the facilities, pitches, clubhouses and all the other equipment necessary to facilitate young people to excel in sport. That €24 million could go a long way. We should think about that, but we also need to significantly increase the amount of money we put into grassroots sports for young people and in local communities."

                "The cost overruns and lack of value for money evident in the context of the Appropriation Bill are a major issue. One of the most glaring issues that arose in 2024 is the persistent problem of cost overruns. Projects across multiple Departments routinely exceed their initial budgets, often by substantial margins. For instance, the Department of Defence has seen numerous projects balloon in cost, with little or no accountability for the overruns. The pattern is not limited to defence infrastructure projects. The Department of Transport frequently exceeds its budget, leading to a waste of taxpayers' money.",
                "The lack of value for money is another crucial issue. Despite the allocation of substantial funds, the outcomes often fall short of expectations. We can look at the healthcare sector for example. When I came into the House in 2007, the health budget was €7 billion. It is now €26.5 billion and there are cost overruns every year. The Minister has been in the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform for a long time, and now he is back in it again. The overruns are just unbelievable.",
                "The Bill also highlights the allocation for the upcoming fiscal year. The lack of accountability is a fundamental issue underpinning the problems. Departments and agencies often operate with minimal oversight, leading to mismanagement and inefficiencies. The absence of stringent accountability measures means that those responsible for cost overruns and poor value for money face little or no consequences. That is not acceptable.",
                "I am a small businessperson. Any businessperson, big or small, could not operate in this way. This culture of impunity must be addressed if we are to see any meaningful improvement in Government spending. There must be responsibility. I am not naming anyone, but Secretaries General of Departments are well paid, so one can imagine that they should have sufficient experience to watch spending. It is simply unacceptable. The Appropriation Bill 2024, while necessary for funding the operation of the Government, exposes deep-seated cost overruns, lack of value for money and Government overspending.",
                "Without significant reforms to enhance accountability and ensure efficient use of funds, these problems will continue to undermine public trust and waste taxpayers' money. It is imperative that the Government takes decisive action, but I do not think it will. Let us just take the children's hospital, for example. My goodness. Professor Jimmy Sheehan and others came in here and told us they would build a hospital on the M50. We had a site of 70 acres. They said they would build it for between €900 million and €1.1 billion in 11 to 13 months. They also warned about going ahead with what we are doing. The Minister was invited to the AV room as well to hear that the equipment would be obsolete by the time the hospital was built, and here we are six, seven or eight years later when, of course, the equipment is obsolete. It is shameful to put the hospital in the wrong place, with no helipads other than a small helipad for the right craft on a calm day. The children's hospital is the most massive example.",
                "Then there is the bike shed, which we all hear about when we knock on doors. Someone must be accountable. Every Minister says he or she knew nothing about it. The Taoiseach knew nothing about it. He is angry. He said it should not have happened and it will not happen again. We get the usual stuff. No one is accountable. Somebody - the procurement officer and his or her superiors - must be responsible for it. They must be responsible for it.",
                "Then we heard about the security hut on the way into Agriculture House. No one is responsible for that either. This is not acceptable. Heads would roll in any private company - full stop. They just could not argue the toss. First, it would not happen because the company would not keep functioning. How come Government projects are a soft touch? When the M8 motorway and national roads were built by Sisk and Roadbridge, the different elements of them came in under budget and ahead of time.",
                "It was well publicised and acknowledged at the time and rightly so. I saw the way they worked and built those. Why is it that since then we are allowing such laggards and allowing this to happen? The funding is going back to Departments. Deputy Boyd Barrett talked about the money going back in sport. I think he said €24 million. I know that many clubs, including my own club in Newcastle, had money allocated for two years but unfortunately, An Bord Pleanála turned down their planning application. That is the kind of money that will probably have to be returned and I can understand that with projects but €24 million is a lot of money. I was talking about a couple of hundred thousand euro. We know there are issues like that. There has to be planning permission and boxes ticked but that kind of money going back is unacceptable.",
                "To think that €129 million is going back on national roads, how could this happen? We had uproar this year, and rightly so, when many existing national road projects were taken out of the proposed road works because there was no funding. In my town, we had the very same thing. Funding was pulled for the pavement overlay in the town of Fermoy. Councillor Peter O'Donoghue and many others contacted me about it, even though I am not from that area at all. It is a massive issue. They are coming up here to do sit-ins at the Department's offices. How can this happen? How can €124 million be going back? It is only early November. There is €124 million going back when there are projects waiting. Take the N24, soon to be M24, project under Arup consultants which runs from Pallas Green to Cahir at Cloghabreedy. Thankfully, that is continuing after a lot of lobbying to get the couple of million to keep the consultants in place. The other leg, the most important part of the road, runs from Cloghabreedy roundabout outside Cahir on to Clonmel, Carrick-on-Suir and then on to Pilltown in Waterford and parts of Kilkenny. Kilkenny County Council is the lead design team but that has been stalled. Arup consultants got the contract and it was going to cost €3 million to keep them engaged on that most important, long-term and desperately needed upgrade to that road. We thought it was going to be upgraded to a motorway but now we have been told it will be a single carriageway. Nonetheless, it has stopped dead in the water for the sum of €3 million. The same happened two years ago and Deputies from all the affected counties - Kilkenny, Waterford and Tipperary - got together and thankfully, money was found. A sum of €3 million is not an awful lot and we see a vast amount of money going back. This should not be happening. That whole stop-start process should not be happening. How can we develop projects if we are going to be depending on consultants from one year to the next to bring them on from the pre-planning stage to notice to treat stage and all of the different ideas and design stages? We have to have continuity. There is no point in funding it for last year and this year and then there is no funding and it stops dead in its tracks. That kind of piecemeal approach, with a lack of forward planning, is not good enough. Again, a businessperson would not be able to sustain that.",
                "Someone must be responsible. The buck stops with the Minister, the Taoiseach and all of the other Ministers but it also stops with the Secretaries General of the Departments. The Secretary General of the Minister's Department was asked at one stage to move to the Department of Health and he got a huge increase in wages. That would not happen in any private sector because it could not happen. I think the increase was €20,000 on top of an already exorbitant wage. What is so special about these people? They do a job and they are paid to do a job and they must have the competence but we need answers. We cannot go out and face the public and tell them who is responsible for the bicycle shed, the hut behind Agriculture House, or the printer that would not fit into the print room. I thank the printers for all of the work they do for us. Who could procure an item that would not fit? Who was responsible for procuring the Luas that would not fit over O'Connell Bridge and blocked the traffic? Where is the joined-up thinking? Somebody must be held accountable.",
                "We have been entrusted by the people, and I thank the people of Tipperary for supporting me to get in here to ask these questions. This just beggars belief. We have to go back now, wave our hands and tell them that we do not know or that nobody is responsible. Nobody is responsible. Nobody knows who is responsible. That is not acceptable in a so-called democracy. It is not a dictatorship that we are working in. We have to be held accountable. The Minister has to be held accountable and, in turn, Secretaries General and senior officials have to be held accountable. Nobody is accountable. They are operating with impunity. There are no repercussions for the wilful waste. The old saying is that wilful waste makes woeful want and my goodness, have we wilful waste going on at a time of such need. There are people with scoliosis and a plethora of different problems and issues. They badly need money. I have mentioned Scoil Aonghusa, special schools and special places in Clonmel. When people look at this, they will not vote for any of us. They are deflated, disappointed, disgusted - there are not enough adjectives to describe it - and one cannot blame them, with the waste and the lack of accountability. These issues come up in the media, in The Ditch or wherever and no one is responsible. It just happens; it is Santa Claus or I do not know who. Nobody. That is not acceptable in any democracy. This is meant to be an accountable democracy. We are meant to hold people to account. We have the Appropriation Bill here and we are meant to get answers but it will be the same next year."

I will respond now to a number of the matters that were raised in this debate, including the issue of accountability in relation to the huge amounts of money that I am asking the Dáil to vote on this afternoon. I thank Deputies for recognising the importance of the passing of this legislation but I would emphasise that in order to get to this point, Revised and Supplementary Estimates had to be passed in order for this Bill to be passed. Those individual Estimates were all debated by the Oireachtas in the relevant Oireachtas committee.

That involved Ministers bringing those Supplementary Estimates before their Oireachtas committees to be scrutinised at that point.",

As Deputies Conway-Walsh and Ó Snodaigh acknowledged, it normally happens during the month of December, later in the year but we know that it is not happening then for other reasons.

Even though it is a very large amount of money, it is a comparatively small amount of the total capital budget that was available to all Departments. The money is being carried over but that does not mean it is being handed back. It just means that it is going to be spent at a different point. Deputy Boyd Barrett talked about €24 million but that money is not being surrendered back. The money is still with the Department of sport. What it means is that instead of being spent in October, November or December, it will be spent in January, February or March or at some other point next year.

In fact, because it is a carryover, it is being retained within the Department but spent in a different year. The absence of a carryover would mean the money is not being spent in the Department but the presence of a carryover means that it is. There is a real and fundamental misunderstanding of what a carryover is here. The money is being spent but just in a different calendar year.",

I am here in front of the Dáil and in front of an Oireachtas committee very regularly regarding the use of taxpayers' money and that is as it should be.",
                "I will be the first to acknowledge there are a number of areas in which things should have been done better, and I have acknowledged that in the past. I will still make the point that the vast majority of our country's money, particularly when it comes to capital expenditure, is being used in the way the country would want and does deliver projects that are either on time or broadly on budget.",
                "I will make a broad point about costs going up. Just because a cost goes up does not mean it is the same thing as a cost overrun. We have gone through a period in which the cost of building anything in our country has gone up for reasons that are beyond our control. The Deputies will know this as well as I do. The prices of concrete, wood, metal, energy and all the things we need, just as the private sector needs, to build a home or deliver a wastewater treatment plant or any other project have gone up. Much of that increase is because the costs of raw materials and energy have also increased. The cost of something going up is not the same as a cost overrun. In many cases, the increase is not due to any alleged incompetence or inefficiency. The private sector is having to spend more to deliver certain projects, and no State or Government is immune to those changes in the price of the raw materials we need to deliver very big projects or any projects at all.",
                "Deputy Boyd Barrett made a point about a State construction company. I look forward to having that debate with him in the coming weeks. It is still worth emphasising that the State does deliver and build homes. It builds them through local authorities. As I noted in my speech a moment ago, in 2023, 11,938 social homes were delivered. I know that is not the same as built and I know many of them were purchased. However, the majority were built by the State. They were built by local authorities, which, as the Deputy knows as well as I, are units or parts of the State. While there is definitely a discussion to be had about a State construction company, and I will have that debate with the Deputy-----"

It does so through local authorities. The majority of those 11,938 homes would have been built directly by local authorities, which is the State. That is the argument I am making to the Deputy. To suggest the State is not involved in directly building homes would be wrong. Even if the State body to which the Deputy referred were to be established, it would still have to buy concrete and employ people at rates that are comparable to those in the private sector because, otherwise, those people would not work for the State. It may well be that the organisation for which the Deputy is making the case would not make a profit and there would be no marketing, as the Deputy has acknowledged, but those aspects are only a comparatively small part of the cost of building a home at the moment. The State will have to deal with all of the other costs that any private sector company is dealing with at the moment and that our local authorities are currently dealing with.",

As I have said repeatedly, there is one Estimate that is not, even though it nowadays falls under the group of Estimates. It is a small figure that can be buried wherever it needs to be buried. The relevant amount is €2 million. There is no accountability to the Dáil in any shape or form. I have referred to the issue in the Chamber in the past and I cannot even ask questions because they are ruled out of order. That is not the fault of the Ceann Comhairle. I asked the Minister for Finance about it in the past, when it fell under Vote 15, and was told the Minister has no official responsibility to Dáil Éireann for the matter. I asked the Minister for public expenditure and reform and was told that the Minister has no official responsibility to Dáil Éireann for the matter. The Minister was wrong to say that all the Estimates go before committees because this particular Estimate does not.",
                "I am seeking a logical explanation. I was, in 2009, provided with a Whip's briefing on the Supplementary Estimate for Vote 12 - Secret Service, as it was at the time. The secret service was seeking a net Supplementary Estimate for €200,000 in 2009. It stated that a Supplementary Estimate was urgently required as the Vote was shortly to exhaust its 2008 allocation. It also stated that funding for the secret service Vote was to obtain information necessary for the country and that, given the sensitivities associated with a Vote of this nature, information about its operation would not be made public. That is fine, to a degree, but I cannot see the Minister or his officials running around and spending €2 million to find information wherever in the world or paying for that. Who is the Government paying?",
                "At the Morris tribunal, which dealt with informants, a specific mechanism was put in place so there was oversight of informers. That was to ensure that if there was money involved or whatever, nothing untoward happened. There is no accountability in any shape or form. In other countries, as I have said repeatedly, there is.",
                "We are now getting less information than we used to. In 2005, former Minister Brian Cowen gave me a breakdown of the allocation and the outturn. We do not even get the outturn any more. We are just told the amount of €2 million. That is all we are told. It is hush-hush and nothing more is said. It exists and is obviously spent because it does not come back to the State. Every year, somebody or something gets €2 million. I have mentioned other bits before. Perhaps it is appropriate, or €2 million is being flushed down the toilet. Perhaps this is the toiletry Bill, an Bille Leithreasa.",
                "Perhaps the Minister can help. I have tried every mechanism to address this. We should take it out of the Appropriation Bill altogether or bury it in the Minister's Department's Estimate if it is meant to be there. The Government has buried a lot more funding in the Department. The amount is only worth six bike sheds or 1.5 security huts. It is not a huge amount of money, and I have accepted that. It might be enough to pay for a toilet in the new children's hospital. It is not a big amount of money. I cannot see why it is put up in big lights every year. It is not hidden away. The Government is upfront about it. As I said, \"Secret Service\" is stated in big letters. We are told every year.",
                "It tells us every year that, for example, the estimate for 2024 is €2 million, the estimate for 2025 is €2 million and the change is zero. There is nothing else. Turning to the explanatory section which outlines public expenses, chapter 14 deals with the Minister's group, Vote 11, Vote 12, Vote 13 and all of a sudden you go to Vote 14 and Vote 15 just disappears. There is nothing. It then goes to Vote 17 because Vote 16 is in a different Department, the Department of housing. Of all the Votes that are allocated in the approximately 300 pages of the document, the only one for which there is no explanation, no accountability to this Chamber or to the committees, is this €2 million.",
                "It is not right that we are told that everything is accounted for, is open for scrutiny and goes before committees, as this does not. As I said, it is not a huge amount of money but somebody should have the decency to explain exactly what this is or who the Accounting Officer is in relation to this. As was said in the past, and it was quite cryptic at the time, it is very different from what happens in the use of taxpayers' money in the provision of other services. What happens here is that the Minister provides a certificate, the Comptroller and Auditor General looks at the certificate and deems it to be correct and then the Secretary General plays an overall financial control role. If that happens, that means a number of public servants have sight of it, but we who are meant to have overall oversight have no role in it, other than just to turn up here, vote and accept it and say nothing. If it is more appropriately located in the Department of Justice, the Department of Defence or some other Department then so be it. I cannot figure out why it is now under public expenditure and called the secret service. Call it something else, if it is not a secret service. There is not and has not been a secret service in this State except for those who are operating Cobalt and others and they are not belonging to this State."

The Minister tried to say it was carried over to next year. How come they cannot get the €3 million to continue the planning and design of the road from Cloghabreedy, outside Cahir, on to Clonmel, Kilsheelan, Carrick-on-Suir to County Kilkenny and onto Waterford and indeed Rosslare? Why carry over the money if they cannot get the money? This does not make sense. Similarly with pavements and overlays in Fermoy. Many road projects have been cut in County Tipperary this year. The county council was never as scarce of money as it is now.",

There was a lovely clean yard and nothing inside. That was in the middle of October. What happens if we get floods and bad weather? They have nothing. We are handing back large amounts of money. The Minister says it is not handed back as it will carry over to next year. In that case, why are we not allowed to spend it this year?",

                "A local man, Stefan Grace, is a great orator and songwriter. We often hear the song Bridge over Troubled Water, but this is a troubled bridge over tranquil waters. It has been like that for ten years. As importantly, the Minister said to me about the funding that he cannot account for the costs and the cost increase to private industry. I put that back directly on the Minister because I am in that business myself. The Minister added greatly to the cost. Costs have gone up by about 30% for the county council to get in contractors. However, the Minister has added directly to that cost with the carbon tax. He mentioned aggregate and concrete. The people affected by mica were outside the gate today, trying to meet some of the Government. It is not just mica, it is defective housing. The Minister added directly to that cost to pay for a scheme that is not fit for purpose, by putting a 5% levy on every metre of concrete. That adds to the cost. That levy should have been put on the suppliers of the concrete. Why should the taxpayers be made to pony up here and take the bill again? The taxpayers are great people and they carry wide loads. However, as in the time when we had horses tackled to the cart behind them, the taxpayer is beaten down from carrying the can for all these overruns, all the hookery that went on and the defective concrete when it should have been tested. People want to build their houses in good faith. I built my own house, self-employed and I depended on the materials and good contractors. I got them and my house is still standing thank God.",
                "There is now a scheme designed for the people affected by mica and the other people, but it does not deal with the foundations. It is pure lunacy to think that they can get funding to build on top of a foundation. In my business, if you come to dig a foundation on any site or area and you find loose ground, sand or gravel, you have to put in a raft foundation, to make sure you have a good solid base on which to put a house. Now the Government is funding a scheme for people unfortunate enough to find their houses are crumbling, and the costs of the foundation are not covered. Whoever came up with this or whatever engineers advised the Government to do this, it is utter insanity. It is even in the Bible, if you build your house on sand you will not have a house. Houses cannot be built, with taxpayers’ money and the levy that people are made to pay that is driving up the price of concrete, when there is no proper foundation. Anybody who knows anything about building knows this house would not stand long if the proper foundation were not there. The most important part of any building is the foundation, the same as in any organisation. For building it has to be a proper foundation. It is the same concrete, with the mica, with the defect, that has gone into the foundations as has gone into the rest of the house. It does not make any sense. Any lay person without any technical or engineering expertise would know that.",
                "In that case, I want to rebut what the Minister said that he cannot control the cost. He can. He directly contributed to the cost increases by putting on carbon tax for ten years, passed in the budget. We will not even have a vote on this increase on the carbon tax. Then he put a levy on the concrete, instead of making the big people pay, like Cement Roadstone Holdings, CRH, that are multibillion euro companies that have been found guilty of all kinds of trading irregularities in many states, in Canada and the US. However, here in Ireland they walk off into the sunset.",

However, it is folly to have a scheme to build a house on quicksand. It is the same as quicksand. The walls are crumbling and the same concrete went into the foundation. I hate to say it because I have trouble with my eyes, but a blind person could see and know that you cannot build the house on top of a crumbling foundation.",
                "It is a shocking indictment. It is more waste on a large scale to fund these buildings - they need to be funded - without funding the foundations. I do not know how anyone could draw up a scheme that would fund the building and would not fund the foundation. The foundation is the most basic part. I lay it squarely at the Government’s door regarding the cost increases. I cannot understand why this money – the Minister said it is not going back; it is going into next year – cannot be given to the road projects that are stalled now. The surfaces are creaking for want of money. In my own town of Clonmel, the pavements are broken up and busted and the whole town is in a shameful state. Why put it into next year? It is only November. I know it is for a special reason this year in spite of the fact that the Taoiseach kept insisting the Government would go full term. We are expected to have these appropriations.",
                "I have to forcefully rebut what the Minister said that they are accountable and that the Government is scrutinised. I cannot yet answer who authorised, oversaw and signed the procurement documents for the bike shed. I cannot explain to the public who will ask me at the doors tomorrow evening who authorised and who was the procurement officer for the hut that cost €1.1 million. I am tired of talking to people about it. They are aghast and shocked at the runaway cost of the children’s hospital. Who signed the contract, only the Minister’s own Taoiseach who was the Minister at the time? Now I am told, to add insult to injury – I do not have this fully corroborated – that a similar contract is being used for the maternity hospital. How could that happen? I think Einstein said the definition of insanity is to keep doing the same thing over and over again and to expect a different result. Are Department officials and their multiple advisers unable or incapable of having a contract that is fit for purpose? There is plenty of expertise out there. When former Deputy Wallace was here, we spoke the whole time about a hybrid kind of contract that was a disaster. It was an open chequebook. The result so many years later is that we have no children’s hospital. There are sick children waiting for it. Is the same thing going to be done now with the national maternity hospital? The lunatics are definitely running this asylum."

                "I do not want to delay this Bill any further. I understand it needs to be passed notwithstanding the debates we might have about it. It is a little bit odd that anybody would oppose it because this is money we have to have spent to keep the show on the road. We might want to spend it differently or spend more but we need this money to cover the costs of public services and so on that carried us through this year. I understand that the committees scrutinise stuff but not everything is scrutinised as forensically as it should be. It is appropriate to use this last opportunity to question certain things about whether a proper cost-benefit analysis has been done of whether the money is being spent in the best way possible to deliver the outcomes we want, whether the expenditure has achieved the objectives we desire or whether there might be better ways of spending the same money and getting better results. I would hope any government would be open to thinking about those things.",
                "On sports, I did not say €24 million was lost. I think another Deputy used the phrase \"it is going back\" or whatever it was. I did not use that phrase. My point is that €24 million is a lot of money when I know a lot of clubs are looking for stuff and in many cases are not getting it. It is an opportunity to highlight that it would be a good investment to have a more proactive approach when it comes to supporting sports in the community. I have said before that there is often a bit of a “computer says no” approach when clubs go looking for money. If you do not tick certain boxes, they say no or reasons are found to say no. Reasons should be found to say yes when it comes to providing money for community-based grassroots sports clubs looking for more facilities. It is obvious, particularly given the growth in the participation of girls and women in sports, which has grown exponentially and is fantastic, that there is a big catch-up to be done in the necessary facilities. Even before we had a high level of women’s participation in sport, a lot of the sports facilities were pretty awful. When I played soccer and GAA, I changed in containers on the side of fields. There is still quite a lot of that going on. Given that large numbers of women are getting involved in sport, decent quality facilities are required. We should have them anyway but it becomes ever more important. There needs to be a more proactive approach to giving the necessary funding to provide the best quality facilities for grassroots sports, which are often severely lacking. I mark that as an important issue that should be prioritised.",
                "I will not go on – we will debate it over the next while. There has not really been a cost-benefit analysis. While the Minister responded and I do not necessarily agree with him on some of the points I made, he is not fully responding. A breakdown that was produced by the Department of housing came out in September - in fairness, it was not the Minister’s Department - and it makes for interesting reading. If one looks at the breakdown of the cost of construction of a house, including all the different things, one will see that almost every stage involves people brought into the process from the outside. Of course, there will be contractors and private businesses. I do not suggest they will not always play a role in the construction of housing and many other things, but when we need to build the amount of housing we now have to build and when we have the deficit that we do, we have to be able to do this on scale. Even people who are very middle of the road and a long way from me ideologically and politically say that our private construction industry does not have the capacity. We will have to grasp that nettle. We must have construction companies that have the scale to build tens of thousands of houses and those houses must be affordable.",
                "Part of the reason for the last crash was that even when we got up to 70,000 to 90,000 houses a year, they were delivered at astronomical prices. Banks were lending money to people who could not really afford to buy at those prices and eventually the whole pack of cards came crashing down. We had better not go down that road again but we could because the prices I quoted in that document are not sustainable. To be talking about €450,000 to build a house, €550,000 to build an apartment and €590,000 to build an apartment in the city is not sustainable. We have to find a way to drive down the price of constructing housing. If there is a company of scale, there are economies of scale. The Minister surely knows this as somebody who was the Minister for Finance. I did economics for the leaving certificate, so I know about economies of scale. That is why a cost-benefit analysis at least needs to be done to see if the costs could be driven down. There is a labour shortage, which we clearly have at the moment. When we look at the money expended on trying to recruit, find and train people, we should look at models like the ESB, which in its heyday had a large number of apprentices trained. It was an attractive job. Our electricity infrastructure could not operate on a boom-slump basis, could it? It could not, but our construction sector operators on a boom-slump basis.",
                "We had many construction workers in 2008 but then numbers slumped and we are having a real battle to get people back into construction, partly because of the bitter memory of what happened the last time. We have to make it attractive again. There are many reasons to look very seriously - it is an urgent necessity and we should not be flippant about it - at whether this is an absolute necessity in order to deliver housing at affordable levels and the infrastructure we need to address the major problems facing this country.",
                "This is my very last point and it may be the last chance I will get to say it before the Dáil rises. It is in this Bill and it is about out-turns. I have raised it with the Minister many times. It relates to the problem of the public money that I want to be spent in the area of art and culture, particularly in the film industry sector, but which is still not delivering on the industry development test. It is not delivering the income and employment security the crews deserve and need and that the actors, writers and performers in film and our creative sector deserve.",
                "I was looking yesterday at interesting figures from the CSO on average salaries in different areas of the economy. The second lowest is €16,000 a year, for people working in the arts. Most people working in the arts are on an average of €16,000. It is a miserable salary. It is poverty income. It is pretty terrible for a country whose reputation, to a very significant extent, depends on our fantastic literary, cultural and artistic heritage that most of the people who work in that area exist on very low incomes and have a very precarious employment situation. We could be doing better. Irish Equity, the Writers Guild of Ireland and the Screen Directors Guild of Ireland have been saying that the Government may be putting money into this area and want to develop the industry, but the money we put into this industry is supposed to be conditional on industry development and one cannot have industry development if the people who are the core of that industry have absolutely no security whatsoever. Many of these creative people just leave and ask what the point is in being a writer, performer or director when they have to put up with such precarity and incomes are so low. They have asked that the public money that goes into areas like film be much more strictly conditional on the producers meeting the industry development test. For them, that means guaranteeing they are not given crappy contracts where they are forced to sign away their right to future residuals, which all of these people used to get in the old days. They used to get residuals, often for the rest of their lives. They do not get them any more, but they are of critical importance when one is on that sort of low income and living that precarious existence.",
                "It is similar for the crew. Again this week, more of these workers were in the Labour Court. They go in and then the film producer company to which the Minister gives money and which set up the designated activity company, DAC, for the films the crew worked on marches into the Labour Court and says it is not the workers' employer. It set up the DAC and received money from the Government to make this film on the basis that it was going to create quality employment and training but then says the workers are not its employees, even though it is obvious that it is the employer because there is nobody else. It got the money from the State. I just do not believe it is fair to do that. I point out to the Minister that many of those people live in his constituency and they have been blacklisted out of the industry because they asserted their right to the recognition of their service for many years. The Government should do something about that. It would not take much. The Government can just tell the film producers to stop doing this and that it will not give them the money unless they recognise the service of the people who are in that industry, acknowledge that they are the employers and stop hiding behind the DAC. The Government should make that change. It would be good for the development of the industry as well as for the people who work in it.",
                "I am all for the expenditure that has been allocated, and for more in that area, but the Minister should make it conditional on giving decent employment, conditions and rights to the people who work in the cultural, arts and film sectors."

                "I have been in construction all my life, with over 30 years of experience, and am still in construction on a daily basis. I start work on site at 7 o'clock in the morning because most of the Departments I deal with do not open until 9 a.m. or 9.30 a.m. I get my day's work done in the morning before I come to work at all. That keeps me in tune with inflation, labour and material costs and all of the different sectors of infrastructure. I try to bring my experience to this. In 2021, a 1,700 sq. ft house cost €231,540. There is a 13.5% VAT rate cost of €27,540 included in that, meaning the cost before VAT was €204,000. Today, in 2024, that same house costs €350,000. It is almost €119,000 dearer for the same house. The person is only getting the same package but paying €119,000 more. Before VAT, that house is €308,000. The Government now places a cost of €41,630 in VAT on the same new house that the person was getting in 2021. How is anyone - teachers, nurses, gardaí or the people who work in factories - going to be able to afford a mortgage for this house if something is not done about mortgage rates?",
                "At the moment the loan-to-value ratio is 90%. That is fine if the market is stable and one is trying to reach that figure, but people's wages will not allow them to get to that figure. Why not have a 95% loan-to-value ratio? The Government could go to the Central Bank. The guarantee from the banks is 90% but the Government could guarantee the extra 5%. When I look at the maths of it, the Government would actually be guaranteeing nothing in the context of that 5% because it would gather it back through the VAT on the inflation cost. The Government is actually holding the €15,000 extra that purchasers would need. On a house with a purchase price of €350,000, with a loan over 35 years and a 95% ratio, the cost to the person would be €332,000. The 5% deposit would be €17,500. For a family with a combined gross income of €67,000, this would be 24.2% of gross take-home pay. If the Government uses the extra VAT it is taking on the inflated costs, this would cover the 5% we are looking for. Looking over the ratio of mortgages in this country, there is only a 4% default.",
                "This change would mean that people who are renting at the moment and want to buy a house would have the opportunity to do so as they would only have to come up with a deposit of €17,500, rather than one of €35,000. With the VAT rate on the purchase price of the house, the Government is getting that money up front in any event and that would cover the 5%. As I said, houses that previously cost only €231,000 now cost €350,000. For a house with a purchase price of €500,000, a 95% loan would cover €475,000, so a purchaser would have to come up with €25,000 as a 5% deposit. Again, if one looks at the VAT rate on that, the Government is actually holding that in any event.",
                "We should come up with something to help people to qualify for a loan from the banks and cover the 5%. That would allow people to get on the ladder. This is for people who are working and want to provide a house for themselves. They are paying taxes to the Government for working and they would pay taxes for buying their own property, but the inflation costs mean they cannot get on that ladder.",
                "I am a father of four. Two of my sons are saving for a house at the moment. I am a building contractor. You would imagine my sons would have no problem, but every time they go to try to get to the deposit they need for the mortgage, the price of the house is increased.",
                "Then there is the concrete levy being put on houses. It is on all concrete products. Again, we are going back to the person who is working or a person who wants to downsize, having worked all their lives, to allow for the next generation. The tax regime is only hurting the people who work. Why can we not do something to help the working person? The worst off at the moment are the working middle class. They qualify for nothing across the board, but they work and pay taxes for everything. They work and pay taxes for the people who are vulnerable and cannot work. Why can we not look at something like this and use the extra money the Government is taking off them for the purchase of a new house and use a 5% guarantee along with the banking system? Does that not make sense? Does it not make sense for a person who is in finance? There is no risk to the Government because it already has the extra inflationary costs since 2021. This would help people get on the ladder and into houses. It would also deal with the inflation costs. That is what common sense would tell me in the context of the housing market, and it is one way of trying to get people the loan-to-value they want. Looking at all the statistics the Minister gave us and the different things we have, this is a way forward for people.",
                "We also have to look at building houses. To qualify to build social houses, you have to have contracts to the value of millions. There are a lot of smaller contractors that could go in. Let us look at the likes of Mungret in Limerick. The sites are serviced and could be given to the contractor ten houses at a time. That would give the smaller contractor the chance to build these houses rather than going to the big companies. Many of the big companies squeeze out the smaller contractors and ensure that they cannot get on the ladder. The smaller contractors could probably provide these houses to the State at a cheaper price than the bigger contractors and bring a bit of competition back into the market.",
                "Another thing to look at is the Central Bank reviewing banks outside Ireland providing mortgages. Would the 5% guarantee by Government that I mentioned not allow competition back into the market, where our banks are thriving after the taxpayers of Ireland bailed them out? Why can we not bring competition back into the country to ensure that the banking sector lends to people? The same people who dug the banks out are now looking to be dug out in order that they can provide homes for the future. If we look at all the cost rentals across the board, any couple renting has to show disposable income at the end of the month in order that they can afford a mortgage, but rent is not taken into account. It is their current disposable income that is taken into consideration, so, again, if they are renting they are caught. We need to do something to ensure that we have a generation of people who can get on the housing ladder, even with the inflated costs that exist. The Government needs to put a guarantee on the moneys it is taking in by means of VAT from those costs. That would cover what we are looking for, so it would be cost-neutral based on the figures from 2021 to 2024. The Government would be helping working-class people in order that they could create a life for the generation to come."

                "I will begin with Deputy Ó Snodaigh, who raised an issue I am very familiar with because he has raised it with me on a number of occasions. It is worth putting the issue in context. We are talking about €2 million out of the €104.3 billion being allocated under this legislation. Deputy Ó Snodaigh raised important issues of principle. He stated that this is money which, in his view, is not subject to the normal form of Oireachtas scrutiny. He wants to know why and whether any scrutiny is applied to it. This particular Estimate is presented to an Oireachtas committee. It is part of the public expenditure Vote, so it is done by the Minister for public expenditure. However, it is also the case, as the Deputy has acknowledged, that when I am asked what this money is used for, I am not in a position to inform the Oireachtas in relation to it. There is a long-standing precedent in respect of this fund that it is not subject to the normal kind of disclosure that applies to every other euro of our country’s money that is spent. That is not the same as saying it is not subject to any form of scrutiny, because it is. Due to the unique nature of this fund, the Ministers for Justice and Defence provide a certificate to the Comptroller and Auditor General indicating that the money is being used in the way in which it is intended to be used. The Comptroller and Auditor General considers that certificate and then decides whether to provide a degree of authorisation, or not, in respect of it. The Comptroller and Auditor General has provided the latter and has published in his normal accounts a statement to that effect. While I am unable to go into the kind of detail I usually do about this money and its use, it is still subject to oversight in a different way. The outcome of that oversight is published and there is a statement from the Comptroller and Auditor General about it.",
                "On the points raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett, I will begin with the housing issues he touched on. The Deputy talked about there being no need to be flippant. I was being anything but flippant; I was responding to the arguments he made. I stand by my remarks. I made the point that while he can advance the case for the State being involved in building homes directly through a new organisation, which is an absolutely legitimate argument to make, I was simply making the point that in making that case he should not suggest the State is not involved in building homes directly, because it is. It is just done through our local authorities. It is done through Dublin City Council and, in the Deputy’s case, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. The local authorities build many thousands of homes every year. The question I would put to the Deputy, which I am sure we are going to be able to debate at another point, is whether the brand-new organisation to which he refers would take responsibility for the work our local authorities currently do. Would it be competing with the local authorities or would the local authorities be subsumed into this new organisation? My contention is that the best way for us to build homes directly is through our local authorities and if the Deputy wants the State to play a role in the management of land, and I think he is right about that, then we have the Land Development Agency to perform that role, although that is also an organisation he does not support.",
                "Deputy McGrath was refuting, or as he said, rebutting arguments I was not making. I never for a moment said the State does not have questions to answer on the use of the country’s money. I said we do. I acknowledged that in my response to him earlier. I was simply making a point, which I think Deputy O’Donoghue was acknowledging – if I am putting words in the Deputy’s mouth he will correct me – about the fact that there is cost price inflation happening that is not caused by the State.",
                "Deputy O'Donoghue will make the point regarding the concrete levy back to me, and I will address that in a moment, but if he intervenes again I think he would acknowledge that things are happening regarding prices within the economy that this Government or any Government is not in a position to be able to constrain. I cannot determine, and nor can the Government, what is the price of concrete. We have added a bit to it but other forces are going on that are separate to Ireland at present and which in turn are having a large impact on the issue Deputy O'Donoghue raised and which I will come to in a moment. That is the only point, however, I was making to Deputy McGrath earlier on.",
                "I will make the point again because it has to be made. A carryover is not the same thing as the money being lost. In fact, it is the opposite. If a Department has a carryover, it ensures the money is there for it for the following year. In the absence of a carryover, it would not be able to spend the money next year. The reason it happens is, for example, if you have a Department that is involved in building a bridge or road, sometimes the costs fall in a different way during the year from how they would have been planned. That is what is at the heart of this.",
                "Deputy McGrath continues to suggest that if a project overruns in any way, that is due to incompetence or inefficiency. At times, there are issues there that I am accountable for to the House but the vast majority of the time, I still argue to the Oireachtas that our country's money is used in the way in which the Oireachtas intends it. You can see that in the quality of new school buildings that are being delivered, the quality of the public and social housing our local authorities are building and in the impact the national broadband plan is having on towns and villages.",
                "Finally, Deputy O'Donoghue raised a really important issue that is a big part of the housing difficulties we currently face. As the Deputy said, in the space of a short number of years, the cost of building a house or apartment has gone up by a lot. As the Deputy is a builder and is actively involved in this in a way that I am not, I suspect I am about to tell him a few things he already knows well. I do, however, want to put them on the record of the House because he has raised important issues.",
                "Part of it is the issues I have already talked about on what is happening in raw materials. Part of it is we have certain standards we want met and I think are worth meeting, for example, relating to energy efficiency but which then have an impact on the cost of the home. To pretend otherwise would be to deny that there are trade-offs if we want homes to be built that have a higher energy rating. I believe it is worth doing that because over time it will be good for the cost of heating a home, which will go down. I believe it will be good for our health and for our efforts to get climate emissions down. There is still, however, a cost for it. The State absorbs some of it but the person who is buying the home also has to face some of that cost.",
                "The Deputy went on to ask whether the State should play a role in lending that money to deal with the cost of the additional credit that is needed to deal with the cost of the home having gone up. I will say to Deputy O'Donoghue that is the reason we have the help to buy scheme and is why we increased the value of help to buy, which we did early in this Government's term, by recognising help to buy gives back to a taxpayer some of the taxes he or she already has paid. We only link it to new homes and we include self-builds because if your son or somebody else is building that home directly for himself or herself, it is still adding to housing supply and is a home such people are going to live in. The very reason we have help to buy and then increased the value of it, however, is to respond to the issue the Deputy has raised. In the first home scheme set up between the Departments of Finance and housing and our banks for home purchasers of certain levels of income trying to buy certain homes, we have a way in which the State plays a role in trying to bridge the gap between what they can afford and the impact of the macroprudential rules. That is a way of doing it.",
                "As I said, the Deputy has called out a big issue affecting the supply and affordability of homes but we have schemes in place to try to respond to that. I am sure he will have views with regard to their adequacy. He may well argue they should be bigger in value and so on but we are trying to deal with the issue in a way that I have just described.",
                "Plenty of issues have been raised here that are not about the spending of money but which are really important to the well-being of those we are trying to serve. I have done my best to respond to all of them. The final point I want to make relates to Deputy Boyd Barrett who talked about the need to support sporting and voluntary organisations. We are currently making sports capital funding available in very large sums of money and it is a huge effort to do that. It is far from a case of the computer says \"No\". In many cases, the computer is saying \"Yes\" because of the quality of applications that are coming in. Really amazing applications are being made by nearly entirely voluntary organisations all across the country. In addition, earlier this week, the Government made available large-scale infrastructural funding, much of which will be going to organisations that are a lot more than voluntary and are running large sporting activities, which are either about sporting excellence or are about trying to continue to support voluntary organisations.",
                "Many issues have been raised, a Cheann Comhairle, but this is an awful lot of money. Again, I thank the House for its co-operation in passing this Bill. Going back to a point I made earlier, even though the amount of debate here today may have been relatively small, these figures have been debated elsewhere in the Oireachtas at some length during the year."

                "The council was invited to a discussion with the committee in September 2023 on the review of the national planning framework, and the secretariat to the council, of which Mr. Hussey and Ms Kelly are staff, has attended meetings of the planning advisory forum throughout 2024. The council published the eighth and final part of its annual review in October in which it highlighted the need for urgency when it comes to concluding the national planning framework review this year. We reiterate this message to the committee today, given the dependence of many sectors on planning policy to achieve decarbonisation and adaptation objectives.",
                "Planning is fundamental to the fulfilment of national climate goals and the council considers the NPF, including regional targets for renewable electricity generation deployment, to be a pivotal policy document.",
                "This is a critical policy area that the council has consistently highlighted the importance of. In its 2023 annual review, the council noted that planning reform will be required to remove barriers to policy implementation across a number of sectors with a need for the new national planning framework, in particular, to better reflect our climate ambitions. The council also wrote to the heads of Government in May 2023 in relation to a number of elements of the planning system focusing on deployment of renewable electricity, spatial development and resourcing.",
                "In September, the council wrote to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage to express its views on the draft revision to the NPF and to emphasise a number of areas where the plan could impact on achieving Ireland’s climate targets. I will set these out briefly. To ensure that Ireland reaches its full renewable energy potential, the council stressed the importance of providing maximum clarity to local authorities on their contributions to national targets. It also urged the finalisation of the long overdue wind energy guidelines at the earliest opportunity. The council urged a stronger focus on managing development to ensure genuine compact growth. This includes setting more ambitious targets, prioritising the use of brownfield and infill sites, urban regeneration and finalising the rural housing guidelines that align with overall targets.",
                "The letter highlighted the need to enable and support the roll-out of district heating in tandem with the roll-out of other low-carbon heat sources. An increased focus on transport-oriented development within the national planning framework is necessary to maximise the benefits of increased compact growth. The role of the National Transport Authority in planning for transport delivery should be enhanced across Ireland’s cities. The council highlighted the need for a renewed focus on climate resilience and biodiversity, and it reiterated its call for a detailed coastal management plan to enable local authorities to begin planning for the impacts of sea level rise. Additionally, there needs to be a greater emphasis on nature-based solutions and increased awareness of the biodiversity impacts of development more generally. Finally, the Government must regularly measure and report on progress across these and other indicators.",
                "It is imperative that the new national planning framework is adopted before the dissolution of the Dáil or at the earliest possible date following the election, which looks like it is going to be called soon. As set out in our opening statement to this committee in 2023, once the NPF review has concluded, a number of parties across the broader system will be critical to ensure implementation aligns with our climate goals. This will, for example, include the further development of regional spatial and economic strategies by the regional assemblies. The Office of the Planning Regulator will also play a crucial role in the assessment of local authority and regional assembly statutory plans to ensure alignment with the objectives of the revised NPF and to ensure that plans provide for planning and sustainable development. Strong political support at all levels will be required to ensure there is strong oversight and implementation of the principles of the NPF. Community engagement will also be essential.",
                "We are in year 4 of the first carbon budget. While recent reductions in emissions have brought Ireland closer to achieving its first carbon budget, the lack of significant progress makes it unlikely that Ireland will meet its second carbon budget in the period from 2026 to 2030. The NPF will have a critical role in enabling the transition and must be implemented swiftly. Insofar as possible at this stage of finalisation, the council recommends that the current draft should be further strengthened to support the expansion of wind and solar generation. As set out in the council’s 2024 cross-sectoral review, this should address key areas such as ensuring that Ireland’s full renewables potential is achieved; managing development for genuine compact growth to help to enable climate solutions such as district heating, active travel modes and public transport; and preparing for the impacts of climate change such as sea level rise while further developing the potential for the implementation of nature-based solutions.",
                "The council is happy to assist this committee in supporting the achievement of Ireland’s climate objectives and provide any further assistance or advice as required. I look forward to our discussions today."

                "We welcome this opportunity to provide an update to members of the committee on the draft first revision of the NPF since our last engagement with the committee on 11 July. I will start with the issue of public consultation. When the Department engaged with this committee in July, the draft revised national planning framework had just been published for public consultation. The national consultation period commenced on 10 July 2024 for a nine-week period and concluded on 12 September. Members of the public were invited to make a submission on the first draft revision of the NPF document and accompanying environmental assessments via the online consultation portal and by post. The online consultation portal was the primary interface for the public to make submissions on the draft revised NPF based on the fact that it provided a convenient, low-cost, transparent and efficient means of public participation to drive increased public engagement.",
                "An information campaign raised awareness of the consultation process to encourage the public to engage with the draft revision. This campaign included national and regional newspaper advertisements, a national and regional radio campaign and digital and social media advertising. Cumulatively, these channels of communication ensured that notice of the revision process reached the widest possible audience to ensure the public were made aware of this consultation and to actively encourage participation. A total of 272 submissions were received on the draft revised NPF. More than 90% of all submissions made were received via the online consultation portal.",
                "I turn now to the key issues raised in the public consultation. The number of submissions were received. The range of topics raised in the submissions meant some matters raised fell outside the scope of the NPF as a national policy framework document. This was particularly true where the focus of submissions related to investment, expenditure, delivery and inclusion concerning specific projects, notably infrastructural projects. The core thematic areas raised, with the majority of submissions received, can be summarised under various headings, the first of which is balanced regional development. A significant number of submissions addressed the core objective of the NPF relating to balanced regional development, which is concerned with achieving more regionally balanced population growth, split roughly 50:50 between the eastern and midlands region and the rest of the country, namely, the southern region and the northern and western region.",
                "The strategy seeks to promote continued growth in the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly area, but with substantial growth also occurring in the Southern Regional Assembly and Northern and Western Regional Assembly areas. Divergent opinions were expressed, with some submissions arguing that the strategy could result in a downgrading of Dublin and its hinterland at the expense of other regions that could negatively affect economic development and, therefore, damage the national interest. Other submissions argued in favour of an increased share for the other regions as a means to grow the regional cities to cities of scale and thereby provide viable alternatives to Dublin. A wide range of submissions were also received relating to specific population targets for cities and regions, with contrasting views expressed, including, for example, that the targets for Dublin were not ambitious enough.",
                "Other submissions argued for a much greater emphasis on the regional cities. A number of submissions argued that this key objective of the strategy is not being achieved having regard to the results of the 2022 census and other indicators and that a range of additional measures will be required if the objective is to be delivered.",
                "On population and housing targets, a significant number of submissions addressed the issue of population and housing. Many submissions made reference to overall housing targets, with some suggesting that a notional target of 50,000 residential units underestimates the projected need and that the issue of pent-up demand will result in a significantly higher target. Various targets were suggested in submissions. Most suggested 60,000 to 70,000 homes per annum but some ranged to 100,000 per annum. Many submissions offered alternative assumptions to those underpinning the ESRI population and housing projections with regard to household size and housing obsolescence.",
                "On zoned land requirements, a number of submissions asserted that there is an underprovision of zoned serviced land in parts of the country, particularly in the eastern region, and that the revised NPF should indicate to local authorities that significant additional rezoning will be required to meet housing demand. It was submitted that the biggest capacity constraints for accelerated delivery of housing are capacity constraints in the supply of zoned land with infrastructure and planning.",
                "With regard to implementation and infrastructure delivery, a substantial number of submissions raised the matter of investment in and delivery of infrastructure, with particular regard to transport, water and wastewater services. Strong representations were made for specific projects at local, regional and national scale. The key enablers listed in the draft revised NPF for the cities were also the focus of a number of submissions. From a regional development perspective, submissions set out the differential in expenditure between the regions as a means to highlight the need for specific targeted investment to address identified infrastructure gaps and to support the regions in reaching the ambitious targets set out for growth, particularly for the four regional cities.",
                "A significant number of submissions addressed the issue of compact growth targets for urban areas, with particular regard to delivery against these targets. Some submissions suggested that the NPF overemphasises compact growth when the country needs a mixture of compact growth in town and city centres and more traditional forms of housing at the periphery of our towns and cities, especially those towns and cities with high levels of employment. Other submissions sought more ambition on compact growth in the interests of climate change mitigation.",
                "On climate and the environment, a substantial number of submissions welcomed and supported the additional policies and comprehensive update regarding the climate transition in the draft revised NPF. The importance of ensuring that climate action is integrated into the planning system was specified in a number of submissions. Calls were also made to ensure the requisite procedural and funding arrangements are in place to enable delivery on the climate targets.",
                "On foot of reviewing the submissions received, a draft schedule of amendments was agreed by the Government to be progressed this morning, 5 November 2024. It is not subject to environmental assessment. The majority of the proposed amendments relate to the inclusion or deletion of text to address minor modifications, clarifications and updates to the main body of the document. One example is the updating of the reference to the all-island strategic rail review, which was published since the draft revised NPF itself was published. A number of specific amendments to some of the national policy objectives are also to be included, for example, a specific NPO relating to flood risk management and another to develop and implement a new programme of monitoring of the implementation of the NPF with a focus on monitoring outcomes relative to the key strategic objectives of the NPF, including more balanced regional development, city-based growth, compact growth and infrastructure delivery. More generally, the theme of infrastructure and implementation across the submissions reaffirms the significant role of the national development plan in enabling the implementation of the NPF and the need for that collaboration to continue. However, the critical need to continue the alignment of NPF policy with expenditure is not solely confined to the NDP. There is a broader requirement for the NPF strategy to be considered more centrally to decision-making processes across government, the relevant State agencies and other bodies.",
                "With regard to the next steps, further to the conclusion of the environmental assessments, which will include strategic environmental assessment, a Natura impact statement, an appropriate assessment determination and a strategic flood risk assessment, the final draft revised national planning framework and associated environmental reports will require the approval of the Government to submit them to the Houses of the Oireachtas for the approval of both Houses before the final revised national planning framework can be published, in accordance with section 20C of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended. Once finalised, the revised national planning framework will be incorporated into the regional spatial and economic strategies and city and county development plans. The proposed amendments have been drafted to build on and update the draft revised NPF strategy while retaining many of the key elements of the NPF such as regional balance, city-focused growth and the continued development of rural communities. We thank the members of the committee for their time and engagement."

While today's session is obviously primarily on the national planning framework and climate change, given that the Cabinet agreed the revised housing targets and that those targets were the subject of my last exchange with Mr. Hogan when he was with us on the national planning framework in July, I will start with some questions on that area.",
                "It is interesting that in his description of the public consultation, Mr. Hogan noted that there were a lot of submissions indicating that an annual average target of 50,000 was too low and suggesting targets of 60,000 to 70,000, which is in line with the recommendations of the Housing Commission. Looking at the figures agreed by the Cabinet today - 41,000 new homes in 2025, 43,000 in 2026 and 48,000 in 2027 - it is really only in 2027 or early 2028 that the NPF proposes to move beyond the emerging demand identified by the ESRI. There is really no consideration of unmet demand or the deficit outlined by the Housing Commission until we hit 2028 and 2029. Taking just those first five years, an annual average of 50,000 will not even be reached. It will be 48,600. I just do not understand the rationale behind those figures.",
                "I will pick up where we left off in July. When I asked Mr. Hogan to justify an annual average of 50,000, he seemed to indicate that this was based on the 44,000 the ESRI assessed to be the emerging demand and a reasonable assessment of unmet demand. This is even poorer than our previous discussion in its attention to unmet demand. What methodology was followed to come up with these numbers? Why were the Housing Commission's mid-range recommendations of approximately 15,000 for unmet demand not taken on board? It is clear a decision was taken not to include it. I am not going to have a row with Mr. Hogan about whether it should or should not have been included. I just want to understand why we have the figures we now have because, for every year unmet demand is not met, that unmet demand grows.",
                "Therefore, we could be in a situation where, if the targets agreed by Cabinet today become the targets of the future Government and are met, unmet demand will continue to grow certainly until the second half of the next term of the Government and probably right to the end. That is very concerning. I am at a loss to understand the rationale behind the figures. That is the first question."

Since then, we have worked with our housing policy colleagues to further assess and estimate what we believe to be unmet demand. That is based on the methodology that I will ask my colleague, Mr. David Dalton, to come in on in a minute.",
                "The decision to publish figures with regard to housing supply to 2030 is separate to the national planning framework. The national planning framework is based on an annual average over the full period to 2040. We have firmed up on our assessment of that figure to just under 54,000 over the full period, and as the Deputy rightly said, that has to be worked up to. As you are working up to it, clearly there is a continuing unmet demand that has to be addressed then post achieving the target. We are looking at the NPF as an overarching national document to cover the full period. Once finalised, that will then enable the targets to be broken down for local government delivery or across the different planning authorities, while also factoring in the range of sources of housing, for example, vacancies."

Given the statutory importance of the national planning framework, and given the fact that if you are not meeting unmet demand over a number of years unmet demand grows and therefore what you will need is your annualised average to be larger going forward, would it not make more sense for the national planning framework to speak to that directly? The Housing Commission is very clear because it goes out to 2037 but it wants the deficit frontloaded in the first five, six or seven years. I assume the bulk of the submissions that Mr. Hogan made reference to take a similar view. It seems to me that by not actually naming in that section of the national planning framework review document not only what the target should be on average out to 2050 but that it needs to be frontloaded, you are creating a situation where unmet demand will continue to grow. Even if you meet that 50,000, we will not be in a much better position in terms of meeting housing need. Clearly, a decision was taken not to support the recommendations of the commission. I would have thought the right place for that to be was actually in the planning framework itself."

If you take any of the constant household size scenarios and you then compare that to the low household size scenarios, that gives you a difference of about 170,000 households.

In light of the conversation we had about housing targets – we are well aware of the hierarchy of the MPF down to the RSES and to the local authorities' development plans and we are also acutely aware of demand on the ground – it would be helpful if the Department could set out the timeline from now and where that hierarchy stands for feeding into local authority development plans. That has to happen sooner rather than later. I appreciate the way we have structured it. It is important we have that structure of national to regional to local but there is that capacity constraint. I know we have had this discussion about a different view of availability of zoned land but I feel we need more zoned land not willy-nilly everywhere but targeted in our growth centres and the ability of our towns and villages to grow. Where are we from today, 5 November?"

                "It is important to say that there probably will be a need for more zoned land because we are looking at bigger targets over a longer period in every case for county development plans now that the Planning Act has been enacted and will soon be commenced, or certainly next year. There is a cascade through the planning system from finalisation of the national planning framework through the regional strategies to the local county development plans. There is time for most county development plans because the current six-year plans do not start to run out for the bulk of local authorities until 2026 or 2027 or thereabouts. Obviously they will have to start work in some cases before that. One of the items that the Planning and Development Act includes is an ability for expedited changes to be given effect so there may be instances where there is a need for certain things to be done more quickly. I suggest, without any specific identification of locations, that if there is a situation where a clear level of demand is identified for an area and there is patently not enough zoned land, it may be that the Minister could issue some sort of expedited instruction – I am not sure if the term is a direction – to the local authority to consider zoning more land. Zoning is not the only means or source of scope for housing. People are obviously very interested in that but there are also very significant objectives in the MPF and other documents with regard to vacancy, re-use of existing brownfield sites, transport and intensification of use. There is a lot of scope for further consideration that the planning system will look at."

It is not a parochial issue. It relates to Waterford and how Tramore, which is 8 km out the road, is not included in the Waterford MASP. That is incredible when one looks at Cork, Galway and Limerick which go far in excess of 8 km, 10 km and 15 km in some places. That feeds into the transport elements which have to be factored into planning. To only look at the city and suburbs and not looking at Tramore which is a de facto suburb of Waterford city is incredible to me. Is that addressed or will it be addressed going into this process? That is so important for me."

The background, as the Senator will be familiar with, is that the MASP boundaries and areas more generally were formed on the basis of a particular methodology that is based on the OECD definition and in particular mapping the commuter patterns within a city area where they are greater than 50%. The POWSCAR data we have from the CSO in 2016 informed the initial boundaries that were prepared for the three cities of Waterford, Limerick and Galway. The Cork city boundary had already been established as had the Dublin one prior to that. An exercise was undertaken in conjunction with officials within the regional assemblies and with the Department around preparing the MASP boundary and drafting those on the basis of that particular methodology. Further to our engagement in July, we have undertaken some further research to examine the 2022 POWSCAR data. Because of the time the census was undertaken and the certain element of lockdown associated with remote working and blended working was in force, the snapshot from the 2022 POWSCAR data indicates a contraction of some of those EDs which are now less than 50%."

I was interested to see that engagement there and how Ms Walsh stuck to the line so I fully agree with her on that. These are funny times, in Parliament and in this committee. We are now discussing these issues, which are important. I do not have many question but I thank the Climate Change Advisory Council for its input. We might come back to the Climate Change Advisory Council regarding the critical and important role it sees for the national planning regulator.",
                "First, I turn to the Department. I welcome the Department officials. We all know of the importance of the national planning framework and we have debated this inside-out and upside-down. We have had debates in here on the new Planning and Development Bill. We are literally exhausted. I have been a member of this committee for two terms so it has been for a long time. I have not lost my enthusiasm for it but we have been talking about planning for a long time. I recognise the importance of a strong economy, building competitiveness, innovation, productivity and all of that. That is really important in a society and critical to proper planning and sustainable development going forward.",
                "I sit on the Oireachtas Joint Committee for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and I am always conscious we need to strengthen rural economies and communities and that is something we might have somewhat lost. I have not seen all of the submissions. If I am right, I understand the submissions from the Department will be published. Will Mr. Hogan come back to me on that? That is important because what we are hearing from the stakeholders who advocate for the strengthening of rural communities and economies, which go hand in hand, is that it is about quality of life issues. It is about diversity of the rural areas and all of that. In that context I want to yet again use the opportunity to raise rural planning guidelines. They have been going on for years. This very morning I received a letter from the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, referring to correspondence he received on 30 November, 2024 about rural housing guidelines. He stated:",
                "The draft guidelines are subject to legal review and Ministerial approval, following which it is intended that they would be published for a period of public consultation. The current Sustainable Rural Housing Guidelines for local authorities 2005 continue to have effect and remain in place until advised otherwise ...",
                "The witnesses may have very well have written that or had some act or part drafting it. I do not know, and I do not need to know. What it illustrates for years the promises we have had for years. We have had officials in here week in and week out and we have had Ministers write to us to tell us about rural housing guidelines. We are now heading into a general election but rural communities want to know what is happening about rural planning guidelines. They want to build homes for their young people. They want sustainable, rural communities. They want their siblings to live close by them, with them, near to them. They want to see their parishes, schools and sports clubs survive. They want to go hand in hand and make their rural communities, their land of origin where they are deeply rooted, sustainable. Despite all of the talk we cannot get a commitment from anyone in government since 2005, other than to tell us the rural planning guidelines are being looked at and being drafted. The other side of it is, sure it is the terrible oul' Greens who are holding this up, no disrespect to the Chair, and I do not buy that at all but that is the line, off the record and down in the Customs House, that the Department can do nothing but that we will be out of that loop soon. That is the unofficial talk."

It has been a fairly consistent element of housing supply in Ireland and has been spread across rural areas across throughout the country. Every local authority has a rural housing policy in its development plan. Admittedly, there may be some inconsistencies and differences of approach.

Obviously, it will not be passed in this Oireachtas term as we are going into an election. There will be the formation of a government and a programme for government. Perhaps, a different government comes back which has different ideas on a national planning framework, and it all goes back into the mix again. The critical areas which the Climate Change Advisory Council has been concentrating on are compact growth, renewable energies and it also highlights a lack of definition of transport-oriented development, TOD, in the national planning framework document. We had long discussions on TOD in the planning Bill, where I had put forward a definition of TOD. Would the Climate Change Advisory Council share with the committee what it considers TOD to be? There is one train of thought which says it should be high-capacity, high frequency, high level and almost heavy rail transit whereas others would be of the view that it can represent anything from safe walking ways, cycling and active travel and, of course, public transport buses and trains, etc. Can the council share with the committee its definition of what TOD should be?"

We would have been looking at examples of implementation of transport-oriented development and looked firstly at the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, study and the definition it uses, which is a good starting point. Then we would have looked at the application of that in the first study that was carried out looking at the four local authorities in the Dublin region with regard to specific projects which could be identified there for the progression of transport-oriented development. That considered multiple types of transport looking at BusConnects as well as high-capacity transport corridors. One critical element of it is not just that the public transport is there, or in planning, but that it can be delivered in tandem with those developments in a timely fashion so that transport behaviours, unsustainable versus sustainable, can have time to be bed in. The NESC definition is a good starting point. The Cathaoireach's point in looking at broader active travel, permeability and at active travel infrastructure is also useful.",
                "Another critical piece we would see is looking at the monitoring of the implementation of transport-oriented development and at how we can use the tools that are available through Central Statistics Office, CSO, data, for example, regarding access to services and how long it takes to access services from different areas. We also look at tools and developments by the likes of the National Transport Authority, NTA, to look at accessibility to public transport in areas. There would be a few elements we would bring in there to it. Our point in recommending a definition is included in the revised NPF was simply to assist with when that feeds through into the regional and local strategies, and that that can help with decision-making if it is quantifiable and is easier to define."

We rely very much on what we get from the various sectoral experts on that, as well as our own engagement with home builders. As the Deputy is aware, there is a range of projections. These go from a projection of 32,000 provided by BNP Paribas up to a projection of in excess of 40,000 by Deutsche Numis Research earlier this year. We anticipate being somewhere between the target and close to 40,000 at this stage. It very much depends on what gets delivered towards the end of the year. It is complicated by the fact that we saw a significant increase in commencements in the back end of last year and into January and February. Many of those were scheme houses and, if they come on stream towards the back end of the year, they could actually push us towards the mid to high 30,000s. It is inherently difficult to forecast actual delivery. That is reflected in the fact that the forecasts we saw in the first and second quarters, even from the likes of the ESRI, the Central Bank and others, have been changed in the most recent quarter and moved back to some extent. Others are still maintaining that it will be in the high 30,000s and close to 40,000. It is very difficult to know at this stage."

We see a certain amount of housing development pushed out of urban areas into rural areas. There is obviously rural housing need but there can be urban-generated housing in rural areas that is pushed out for affordability reasons and because people may not have the opportunity for homeownership elsewhere. An apartment constructed in Dublin and costing €550,000 may not even be put on the market for individuals or families to buy. Prospective purchasers may be able to self-build in a rural area for much less than that and get somewhere much bigger. That creates problems in terms of the impact on the environment, car-dependent trave and utility connection costs. We have very high utility costs in Ireland. Given those pressures, are there specific measures in the national planning framework that address those issues relating to affordability, homeownership and compact growth? I have previously put forward resolutions, such as affordable housing zoning, which have not been politically accepted as yet, but is there anything within the NPF which will address that?"

That said, we also believe some TOD sites could be redeveloped urban areas too. The concept of being able to build more places like Clonburris or Adamstown, using, for example, the urban development zone concept we introduced in the planning Act, more rapidly, with a wide range of housing types, many of them affordable, is a very significant spatial development or planning response to the need that is identified for a step-up or ramp-up in the number of housing units."

As regards the broader policy development piece to enable district heating, we saw in the past few days the progression of the heat (networks and miscellaneous provisions) Bill, which is a very welcome development in terms of putting in place that regulatory and legislative framework for district heating. Linked to the point we made in the opening statement regarding the interaction of district heating with other low carbon heat sources, that is pointing to the national heat policy statement, which is a follow-on from the heat study carried out by the SEAI. What we are getting at there is the interaction between zones that are most appropriate for district heating deployment. That is also linked to compact growth targets and delivery of compact growth, which makes district heating networks more effective and deliverable. As regards the interaction between areas that are most suitable for heat pumps, for example, or other low-carbon heat sources, rather than district heating, the way it is currently developing is that we are seeing deployment of heat pumps within areas that might be suitable for district heating networks and that may be eroding some of the business cases for district heating. The SEAI published its updated national energy projections this morning and they raise significant concerns, which the council also raised in its sectoral review for the built environment earlier this year, on the delivery and deployment of district heating schemes on the ground to meet the targets within the climate action plan for 2030.",

Looking, for example, at recent residential development in the greater Dublin area, GDA, one could argue that the vast majority of it is compact growth as per the definitions in the NPF. However, most of it is not really compact growth in terms of the urban core of the cities in which people are living and working. I represent Dublin Mid-West, which is on the other side of the M50. While the densities of developments in Adamstown and Clonburris are very welcome and they are compact, not everybody who is buying there, or buying further afield in Meath and Kildare, lives in those compact growth settlements. That probably relates in some ways to the transport emissions issue Mr. Hussey raised earlier.",

Would it not be better to try to define much more fully what we mean, such that when we say we want compact growth, we are getting genuine compact growth? Is there some other way of measuring it other than measuring it within built-up areas? We had a very good conversation in a meeting with representatives of the Central Statistics Office, CSO, in which we considered that if all development is at the edge of built-up areas, that is not really compact growth because it is contributing to suburban sprawl. From the point of view of the CCAC, could we do better? Is the council looking forward to the amendments to the NPF Mr. Hogan mentioned to see whether these are areas that could be strengthened? We are saying that 75% of new residential development meets the existing compact growth definitions but when we look at the very good mapping by the Chartered Institute of Building of everything built in the past five or six years in Dublin and the GDA, it shows it is all still suburban sprawl, albeit at the edges of existing settlements.

If we compare the highest-density areas with the least-density areas, there are substantial differences in emissions, both from residential sources and from transport.

I take Mr. Hussey's point that it is an improvement on what was there previously but, thinking about Dublin again, there is a problem if much of the residential development that people living and working in Dublin are currently buying is outside Dublin, in the commuter belt, which we can see is where a lot of the development is happening, and if large numbers of those people are still commuting into the centre of Dublin for work, school places, recreation or leisure. The idea of compact growth is not just to have higher levels of density but that people are living in greater proximity to all those other key aspects of their lives. We could end up having large volumes of compact growth but not necessarily getting the emission reductions bang for the buck we want because people are still being forced to commute from a compact growth centre in one location to a centre of life or interest elsewhere.",
                "How can we help Mr. Hogan and his colleagues to think through that? I am conscious that in the most recent completion figures, Clondalkin had the highest volume of completions. Some of that is genuine compact growth because, as Mr. Hogan will know from his time on the council, lots of those people are living locally and there are services and amenities within the developments. However, we know from talking to people that many of them did not live anywhere close to where they bought but it was the only place they could afford, even with the very high prices to be found there. How do we resolve that or at least move it on a bit?"

If people live far away from where they do their other activities, there will be what transport engineers call trip generation. At least if development is compact, we have a bigger chance of moving people towards public transport. There is a benefit even if we do not achieve the spatial match terribly well. This goes back to the earlier discussion on transport-orientated growth. We need to think about that match between activities. When it comes to transport, commuting is only a smaller fraction of a whole. It is the other activities that generate more trips. We must think about how we link up those elements. If we are building compact developments without shopping, social and other kinds of facilities, we will generate more traffic. We need to look at the issue as a whole. Again, that is where the national planning framework comes in. If it does not cover that well and ensure the right decisions are achieved at the local authority level, where a lot of the relevant decisions are taken, then we have a problem.",

I strongly feel from the draft NPF review I have seen that the population targets for the regional cities are not ambitious enough to justify the kind of infrastructure and investment that would be needed to drive the fast and sustainable growth, particularly in the area of rail. In the narrative and in the numbers in the draft, the ambition is quite low for the regional cities, such that if the State is pursuing the NPF as a strategic vision for what the country should be, it is not going to support the case for metropolitan rail systems in the regional cities.",

It is a huge concern of mine that the ambition within the NPF does not support the State investment in rail infrastructure in particular, which is this kind of infrastructure that supports density and developing density quickly more than any other kind of transport infrastructure. Has the CCAC any comment on that?"

It is a real concern for me that the current draft of the NPF again misses the net. While I acknowledge both the 2018 document and this draft are absolutely a step in the right direction, six years on from the original, we should be taking quite a few more steps in the right direction. I do not see the draft as being this. This is the strategic vision for the development of the country through to 2040 and beyond. It is going to lead to some of the problems Deputies Ó Broin and O'Callaghan outlined, that we are going to get more dispersed, more peripheral and lower density settlement, which is going to drive transport emissions particularly. I hope the CCAC could look at that and offer a view to the Department and to the Minister such that we get the right kind of infrastructural investment in the regional cities."

A wise person said to me some years ago that density enables amenity and amenity makes density irrelevant. We have to create good places, they have to be attractive and people have to, I suppose, trade off living in a smaller, denser house for excellent amenities on the doorstep. A modern interpretation of that is the 15-minute city. Again, I strongly agree with the transport planning research. If people do not travel by sustainable means for the main commute of the day, they are unlikely to do that for other journeys or trips. Therefore, the really important thing is to get people on a bus or a train or, if possible, making local journeys on foot or by bike, whether to bring kids to activities or going to the shops. That can be achieved through compact master planning."

That has to be related to the scale of the place because there are serious capacity constraints if a settlement grows by 50% in 20 years.

That is an evidence base that has informed those projections that are included in the revised NPF. Not to labour the point, but one of the clear challenges for some of the regional cities will be the requirement for them to grow by 10% every intercensal period in order to reach that target. I appreciate that the baseline population is different for the regional cities but in terms of the scale and their capacity to grow, that has to be factored in not just in terms of what the targets are for the cities, but their role within the regions. Overall, what the NPF is seeking is a rebalancing or addressing of that unsustainable pattern, focus and concentration of growth that has taken place within the eastern and mid-east area around Dublin, and to address that by ensuring the regional cities are capable, attractive and viable alternatives for development more generally.",

There are numerous national policy objectives, NPOs, that reflect that, as well as key enablers in the metropolitan area transport strategies that clearly indicate there is a whole sequence of delivery and investment that is also enabled by other State bodies and agencies and which the NPF brings together. It is not just a case of the population not necessarily being ambitious enough. There is a series of interventions and policy areas that the NPF co-ordinates. Part of its role is to enable all of this to be integrated at a regional tier of plan-making, and thereafter into a local tier of plan-making, to ensure there is complete clarity and alignment around what the vision is for our regional cities."

My colleagues from the regional cities will be making exactly the same point. I want to add an additional observation for Mr. Hogan and his team and it builds on my questions to the Climate Change Advisory Council. It is that there is also an issue about where the growth is within the city. One of the big concerns I have about Dublin, and I represent the suburbs, is that we are seeing very little meaningful residential growth within the urban core of the city and that is causing all sorts of problems, whether social, economic or environmental. For me, it is not just that we get balanced regional growth, about which Deputy Leddin is correct, but we also need to make sure it is compact growth in the truest sense of the term.",
                "I am almost talking against my constituency by arguing for greater levels of development in the urban core of Dublin. I am sure there is nothing in what I am saying that Mr. Hogan disagrees with, and a lot of this has more to do with implementation than with what is in the planning framework. However, in the amendments, we need to have some way of differentiating even the grades of compact growth. Adamstown and Clondalkin, which I represent, are not the same as the urban core of Dublin between the canals. We need to see far greater residential development in those areas. One of the things the core has that we are struggling with in Dublin Mid-West is the other amenities. For example, there is significant residential growth in Dublin Mid-West but the vital public services that should be going in there in parallel are not going in, and the significant lag in school places, GPs and all of those additional journeys that Mr. Morgenroth mentioned are causing real problems. People in Adamstown are travelling to Meath and Kildare to get GP services, for example, and their children cannot get schools within the general election constituency. Again, that is not something the NPF, as a document, can fix and it has to do with the implementation and alignment of capital programmes. However, if there was a way of grading or almost heat-mapping the compact growth, as is done in the census, it would be useful. I just say that as an observation.",
                "I have two questions for Mr. Hogan. Can he give a summary of the areas of the amendments? Obviously, we eagerly await their publication. At this stage, can he give us headline summaries of the amendments that the Department is working on, given there was an amendment timeline? As Mr. Hogan knows, I was pleasantly surprised when he told us at the last meeting that there would be an Oireachtas vote on the NPF because that is the right approach. However, if the relevant section of the new Planning and Development Act that removes that requirement is enacted between now and whenever the next government is formed, will it be that new section of the Act that governs the decision of the Government or will it still have the option of proceeding as was set out by this Government? Ultimately, it is a political question. I have a strong view that given the importance of this document having the democratic legitimacy of an Oireachtas vote, it is politically, but also probably legally, a much stronger position to be in.",

We have already touched on the inclusion of the definition of transport-orientated development as part of that. One of the main areas for which amendments have been drafted or proposed more generally relates to the strategic environmental assessment and that ongoing element of this particular area of work. Amendments are proposed for Chapter 9 to reflect on the climate challenge more generally, which will certainly be of relevance from this committee's perspective. There is a lot of strengthening of language, particularly in the national strategic outcomes included in Chapter 10, but also within Chapter 9. Further emphasis is given to the biodiversity crisis. Subsequent to the NPF going on display, we are now into the preparation of the nature restoration plan more generally and the integration and implementation of the national biodiversity action plan. The nature restoration legislation has also been enacted. There is a very specific response to that within the draft schedule of amendments in Chapter 9.",

There have been very helpful developments such as the housing delivery tracker being made available, which allows us to observe some of the raw data in this regard. We are certainly into the phase of building that monitoring element so that it can be durable and remain live for the duration of the NPF, a phase that accompanies the finalisation of the NPF.

Objective 75 states that each regional assembly must identify and allocate a level of renewable energy within its region. Will they then allocate that to each county or is it up to the counties?

That is where NPO 76 picks up the baton. Each local authority would then take that approach, working back up towards the overall national target.",

While it is not specifically addressed in the NPF itself, there is also a need for further policy support to build on this objective and approach in the NPF. The intention is to do that through the wind energy development guidelines or a national planning statement. The NPF is a high-level strategic document. It would not be appropriate for all of the detail to be included in it. The clarity and further detail will come in the national planning statement. When you get to the local authority, the intention is to provide further clarity through the national planning statement as to how to approach identifying certain lands as regards their suitability for, for example, wind energy development. There will be a classification system for land based on areas that are acceptable and those that are less acceptable for various reasons. There is a methodology to be applied in doing that. We have been working with our colleagues in the Department of the environment on developing that methodology for both the regional assemblies and the local authorities, when it gets to that level of plan-making. This is all to reflect the plan-led approach we have been discussing with the committee over the course of the year in respect of the legislation. That will provide a much greater degree of clarity within the development plans as to the capacity within each local authority area for these types of renewable energy developments and what lands are considered to be appropriate. Local communities and those wishing to undertake renewable energy developments can then progress applications based on those plans."

It is so much easier to build a three-bed semi on a greenfield site. It can be done in a certain amount of time, almost by the numbers. However, there is another cost saving when it comes to compact growth. Consider what the State has to do in providing roads, power, lighting, transport, water and so on to sprawl development. That is looking at compact growth as part of a bigger picture. It is not looking at a four- or three-bed semi-detached that under construction costs produced recently costs €450,000 to build. When do we start looking at these things in the round, and not just the environmental, societal and climate cost savings of compact growth versus the cost when it is sprawl development? When do we start looking at the real long-term costs?",

However, the house you buy today is nothing compared with the house built in 1980, which people say was more affordable, and it was. The two are not comparable in terms of long-term running costs and the services that should be in place with good compact growth and proper planning. When do we start looking at it in overall economic terms instead of just looking at the price tag for the purchaser?"

This time around, there is more research locally. The Housing Commission looked at this issue and compared parts of Lucan with Leixlip in terms of theoretical expansion, and one way of doing it versus another. We did something similar. We commissioned research to back up the compact growth approach in the NPF, which, as can be seen from the range of submissions, has been criticised in some quarters. I will ask Ms Mulhern or Ms Walsh to summarise what we did. The cost differential between compact and non-compact growth is significant, and that is a preliminary bricks-and-mortar and service-provision view. It does not take into account things like carbon emissions."

It is to get to the nub of the question as to the long-term cost to the State, utility providers and infrastructure agencies more generally. There is a breakdown applied and I can source the figure if the Chair will bear with me. However, it indicates there is a substantial differential between the short-term affordability seen for greenfield development versus the longer term cost that accrues to the State over time. It absolutely feeds back into decision-making around where development should be targeted and focused. That all links back, and it is an important cost element that had not previously been to the fore in discussions in the way it should have. This has certainly arisen with our colleagues across government and has brought a sense of perspective to some of it.",

There needs to be investment in Irish Water, the grid and transport infrastructure. We also need people to build those extra houses. It is probably a matter for the Climate Change Advisory Council but there are considerable challenges there. It is easy to pick a figure based on research showing expected population growth, household occupancy rates, obsolescence rates and so on and say this is the figure the computer will spit out based on the evidence. However, it is about trying to construct those units in the right places. Building apartments is very expensive and we need 200,000 of them by 2030. It is a massive challenge.

I will go back to the previous conversation on the research that is being conducted by the Department on the comparative cost of greenfield and brownfield development. That is really welcome. The figures we discussed align with what we had seen in the report I mentioned from the Office of the Planning Regulator on brownfield land activation. That looked at the international norms and suggested there is an additional cost to the State of between €100,000 and €150,000 for servicing a greenfield site versus a brownfield site. There is, therefore, also an economic argument to build on what was discussed around compact growth.",

What we have seen from looking at planning applications for renewable electricity in terms of onshore wind and solar this year is that it has not been progressing at the pace that is required to meet our targets.",

There could be a little bit more in that because, as we discussed, not everything can be in the national planning framework. It is also about looking at the issue of the repowering of existing renewables because without looking at that, while the current regional targets that have been set out in the MPF meet the targets for new renewables in the climate action plan, if we lose a significant amount of capacity between now and 2030, it will not meet the targets either. I am just pointing out that document should maybe look at that as well."

With the Cathaoirleach's agreement, I will now present for the committee's consideration the Supplementary Estimates for the Department of Foreign Affairs. These relate to Vote 28 - Foreign Affairs. In total, the request we are making is for a net increase of €88.3 million in Vote 28. This will increase the total voted net expenditure ceiling for the Department of Foreign Affairs from to €272.791 million to €361.091 million in 2024.",
                "Members will have received the advance briefing note provided by my Department. This summarises the reasons for the increases, which I will be happy to explain in a bit more detail and then respond to any further questions that the committee might have.",
                "The Department’s request is for an additional allocation of €98.3 million gross, or €88.3 million net. This takes account of anticipated additional income of €10 million, mainly arising from passports. The specific reasons for the Supplementary Estimate are as follows. The largest part, €74 million, relates to Ireland’s contributions to multilateral organisations. This can be broken down into two main components. First, we are seeking €42 million in respect of Ireland’s contributions to the European Peace Facility, an instrument aimed at enhancing the European Union's ability to prevent conflicts, build peace and strengthen international security. Given the huge upsurge in needs, emanating in particular from the conflict in Ukraine, a number of decisions have been taken in the past year providing for increases in the ceiling of the EPF, and this now stands at over €17 billion. Based on that ceiling and the gross national income key that currently applies, Ireland’s total commitment up to 2027 stands at approximately €400 million, of which approximately €250 million arises in respect of Ukraine, and the Supplementary Estimate will go towards that. Ireland fully supports Ukraine in defending its sovereignty and territorial integrity, in line with Article 51 of the UN charter. It is worth recalling that total support for Ukraine under the EPF now amounts to €11.1 billion. In line with commitments in the programme for Government, Ireland has abstained from decisions to supply lethal equipment and does not contribute financially to these aspects of the packages. Instead, our contribution is directed exclusively towards the provision of non-lethal support. Typical examples of the kind of non-lethal assistance provided under the EPF include vehicles, medical equipment, first-aid kits, food parcels, personal protective equipment such as helmets and body armour, uniforms and fuel.",
                "Second, an additional €32 million is requested in respect of Ireland’s assessed contributions to the UN system, in particular, our share of UN peacekeeping costs and the UN general fund and other mandatory costs. Ireland is a strong supporter of global co-operation and has long been committed to multilateralism, in particular, through our membership of the United Nations. Ensuring a strong and effective UN, including through the prompt and full payment of the requisite mandatory contributions, is a key objective of Ireland’s foreign policy.",
                "Mandatory or assessed contributions to the UN can be broken into three parts: the UN regular budget; the peacekeeping budget; and the budget for UN international criminal tribunals. Ireland’s mandatory contributions for the current three-year period are assessed at 0.439% of the UN budgets, an increase of 18.3% over the previous three-year period; this is reflective of Ireland’s increased GNI.",
                "Ireland’s contributions, by virtue of our membership of the UN, are calculated in accordance with the UN budgetary process and contributions are not evenly spread over the three-year payment cycle operated by the UN. Hence, Ireland’s annual contributions are very difficult to estimate due to the nature of this UN process and the timing of the Irish budget-setting process.",
                "A large share of the UN's expenditure addresses its core mission of peace and security. The peacekeeping budget can vary significantly from year to year in line with the size and complexity of operations mandated by the UN Security Council, many of which are subject to annual change. At close to $6.6 billion for the current year, the peacekeeping budget significantly exceeds the UN regular budget, largely due to the increase in the size, number and complexity of these operations worldwide.",
                "A sum of €3 million is requested for administration pay under programme A - advancing Ireland’s foreign policy. This will allow us to meet our pay obligations under the public sector pay agreement 2024-2026. In addition, under the same programme, I request a further €12 million in non-pay administration costs. This funding will support the fit-out of existing and new properties overseas, including new Ireland House premises, as well as higher than anticipated rental, maintenance and energy costs at our properties overseas.",
                "The Department of Foreign Affairs is currently managing a significant number of property projects to realise the ambition of the Global Ireland initiative to enhance Ireland’s global impact and influence to 2025 and beyond. These include: the construction of a new Ireland House in Tokyo, the largest capital investment that the Department has ever made, representing Ireland’s strong commitment to our partnership with Japan; construction of a new embassy office in Abuja; and new Ireland Houses in New York, Chicago and Singapore.",
                "A sum of €4.3 million is requested for the reconciliation and North-South co-operation under the A3 programme. This additional funding, on a once-off basis, is sought by way of Supplementary Estimate to enable the establishment of a permanent professorship in Irish history in Cambridge University. This will facilitate the provision of this high profile Irish history teaching and research position on a permanent and sustainable financial basis though the establishment of an endowment fund. This position will bring a range of benefits for this country and for wider British-Irish relations.",
                "Finally, €5 million is requested to meet operational needs of the passport service under programme B - passport service. This €5 million request comprises €1 million for pay and €4 million in non-pay. The latter will facilitate the purchase of passport books now to ensure continuity of supplies of books during 2025 for this essential citizen service.",
                "In the context of the national development plan, the Department continues to modernise and improve the Irish passport, as well as the systems that underpin production and service delivery for our citizens. The passport reform programme will encompass the redesign and modernisation of the passport book and card, as well as the replacement of existing high-security printing machinery required for passport personalisation. The modernisation of the core back office technology for passport and foreign birth registration processing remains a priority for the passport service. The current software is nearly 20 years old and as we continue to expand our efficiency and capacity for application processing, it must be upgraded. This will ensure that the passport service remains resilient and agile in response to future passport demand.",
                "Our discussion today is focused on the Supplementary Estimate for my Department. However, I also wish to underline to this committee and this House that the situation in Israel, Palestine and the wider Middle East region remains a central priority for my Department. For more than 13 months, we have witnessed horrific scenes. The attack by Hamas on 7 October of last year was one of the worst acts of terrorism that the region has experienced. The Government has condemned this without reservation. Since then, the high number of civilian casualties in Gaza has been absolutely shocking. The scale of death, destruction and unimaginable human suffering in Gaza is truly horrific and completely unacceptable and beyond any moral compass. It represents the collective punishment of an entire people, particularly in northern Gaza. We are essentially witnessing the removal of a population from that particular part of the territory.",
                "Despite calls for de-escalation, we instead are seeing the extension of conflict, in the West Bank and more recently in Lebanon. Massive and indiscriminate air strikes on densely populated areas in Lebanon are resulting in a shocking loss of life. Israel has an obligation to abide by international humanitarian law. I call on it to do so. I call on all parties to de-escalate and to exercise restraint. Let me assure the committee that both I and my officials will continue to play a lead role at EU and international level, through our political engagement and diplomatic efforts, through our unwavering support for the United Nations and commitment to international law, through our financial support to the Palestinian people, through our commitment to the UNIFIL mission in Lebanon and through our consular support to our citizens on the ground. I attended a meeting the week before last in Paris on Lebanon with Arab states and EU member states in an effort to identify a potential role for UNIFIL in a post-ceasefire scenario in Lebanon as well as strengthening the Lebanese armed forces. I look forward to discussing the occupied territories Bill later, as outlined by the Chair. I will deal with that in the latter part of the meeting."

While there are considerations, I do not think it is appropriate or healthy that people have to contact politicians, which they do, and then we get in touch with the Passport Office which is incredibly helpful in that case.

In fact, there has been a very significant expansion in numbers working in our missions. We have grown the missions. We always seem to have contradictory discussions about the public service. Sometimes we say we are spending too much and we do not get value for money. Genuinely, one of the good aspects of the Department of Foreign Affairs and our embassies is the efficiency and leadership at embassy and mission levels. It is quite efficient and we should keep it that way. We have expanded the numbers. In fact, I suspect the challenge in the opening of new missions will be there will be a stretch in experience to some extent and having enough experienced officials to man the leadership positions. I do not really think we are short. That is not what is coming across to us – that we are short staffed. I mention an emergency or a consular case. The Deputy is correct. Unlike most countries, our consular service is one of the best. We have a 24-hour duty officer. If anyone is in any difficulty, they should ring the duty officer who will contact the relevant embassy and so on on behalf of the person or of representatives of the Oireachtas. Generally, it gets a good response. Sometimes the ambassador, a counsellor or someone in the embassy may contact you directly to bring you up to date in respect of a situation pertaining to a person.",

The numbers working in the Department of Foreign Affairs overall have increased, both in missions and fairly significantly in the Passport Office.",

That is the reason we do not believe there is a need for new physical offices. If you apply online, it is nearly within 4 hours in some cases you will have your passport. People say this to me in disbelief. The Deputy is right. Some people will have genuine difficulties. They might not have seen the expiry date on the child's passport. We get those calls; I presume everybody does. Generally speaking, the Department or the Passport Office responds fairly urgently to them. There is the one day on which you can call into the office physically. That is facilitated in Dublin and to a certain degree in Cork. We will continue to try to improve it. Technology will bring more improvements. We have to renew the passport every ten years, as recommended by international security advisers. That is why we are doing the current revamp and the Irish wolfhound will adorn the new passport. It was the people's decision. I know the Deputy has been raising the issue about urgent cases. My sense is that we do respond well to the urgent cases.",

As regards the war itself, it is not until Putin decides to withdraw, and there are no indications from President Putin that he wants peace right now. The evidence is that North Korean troops have now arrived into the battlefield, which is quite horrendous and shocking. That is not an indication of someone seeking a ceasefire. It is very grim for the people of Ukraine and it is grim for quite a lot of people living in Russia, particularly young Russian people who have been brought to the front line. The loss of human life in the form of soldiers on both sides is truly shocking. For some reason it does not get much coverage because it is kind of over there in the battlefield, but the number of young people who have lost their lives is enormous. They are fighting a war that has medieval, First World War, Second World War and 21th century technology all combined into one, which is leading to terrible loss of life and then horrendous destruction of civilian infrastructure, which has caused all the migration out of Ukraine. It is a horrible war. The European Union member states on the border are extremely worried because they are now witnessing hybrid attacks developed by the Russians on their territory, and an increasingly brazen type of hybrid attacks. They really fear the existential aspect of this war for them."

Both Governments provided an endowment of sorts, but not of a huge amount I would readily acknowledge, for funding at that stage to establish the Mitchell scholarship. As a result, hundreds of American graduates have come to Ireland who, in time, will become and are now friends of Ireland and who are in leadership positions in America and in all aspects of American life. I think Trina Vargo was the person who led the charge in respect of that. I will talk to my officials about that and across Government. It may fall to a new Government to develop that."

I note last Wednesday that, with the co-operation with the Lithuanians, €3 million was committed to providing for a bomb shelter for a school in Ukraine. That was a joint initiative. I am not sure if that is under the European Peace Facility or not. The funding that is committed from the Department for such initiatives is very welcome because it is practical support to the Ukrainians but the additional support here through the European Peace Facility is very welcome. The Tánaiste also mentioned the €32 million for the UN peacekeeping missions and he outlined the reasons for that. Does he have figures to hand for the UN peacekeeping missions in terms of our expenditure last year and what expenditure we have increased it by year on year to give a snapshot of the level of increase year on year?",
                "Regarding reconciliation and North-South co-operation, the increase under that heading is very welcome. The Tánaiste mentioned the fellowship, which would be good. That kind of cross-Border initiative is extremely important and it is great to see additional funding is allocated to it.",
                "On passports, I agree with colleagues who have complimented the Passport Office and the work it does. Often, many of the cases are urgent because people have just realised the situation they are in. For those who need passports urgently for either health or bereavement reasons, the Passport Office is exceptionally co-operative and engaged. I have one suggestion, which I have made before directly to the Passport Office, and perhaps through the Department's auspices I can suggest it again, that is, that the checking of documentation that is actually lodged could be done quicker or sooner and at an earlier stage. That would weed out a lot of problems, be they with photographs or documentation missing or unsigned consent forms, etc. It is certainly welcome to see this additional funding because no doubt there is a need for improved facilities.",
                "On the Global Ireland initiative, the Tánaiste mentioned the new Ireland houses that are being opened. Does he, or perhaps any of the officials with him, have a percentage of how many of these residences or premises we own versus lease? In his opening statement he remarked on the increased costs of certain leases. These are obviously required and nobody doubts that but I would love to see us preferring to own the properties rather than lease them out. In some circumstances and in some cities, it makes more sense to lease the property rather than to own it. If the Tánaiste had that percentage for the figure of those leases versus ownership, it would be great."

We also have a very effective cohort of Irish personnel on the civilian side operating in UN agencies in Kyiv and Ukraine, who I have met, in policing. These are people who may be seconded from or, in some instances, retired from An Garda or the Department of Foreign Affairs.

It has all the agencies under the one umbrella, including Enterprise Ireland, the IDA, CIÉ Tours, Bord Bia and Tourism Ireland. The consulate is there as well.

That is the direction of travel. We need to strengthen it. It is a no-brainer as a concept. We should give a collective message to all the agencies out there that we do not endorse the silo mentality. The imperative is to engage in a multi-agency approach."

I will once again mention that for many years, and rightly so, we focused on the United States, but possibly to the neglect of Canada. I have worked with Canadians for the past number of years. I have advocated that we open, for instance, a presence in Calgary in the centre of Canada. It is a vast country with huge resources. More people in Canada per capita claim Irish descent than in the United States. There are huge numbers. Increasing our presence in Canada even more might be something that the Department in the next administration might have a look at, seeing as Nellie Cashman came from Midleton in east Cork. There is a monument to her. She was the saviour of an awful lot of miners way back."

                "I thank the committee for this opportunity to set out the Government’s approach to the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018. Our further consideration of this matter takes place against the backdrop of a deeply troubling situation in the West Bank, including east Jerusalem. The United Nations has reported record levels of settlement expansion and we are also witnessing unacceptable levels of settler violence. Ireland’s position and, indeed, that of the European Union is clear: settlements are illegal under international law and those responsible for settler violence must be held to account. This has been a long-standing priority for the Government. I welcome that successive rounds of European Union sanctions have been adopted against violent Israeli settlers this year and that further sanctions are under consideration. We will continue to actively press for such responses at EU level. It is also notable that other partners, such as the US and the United Kingdom, have also taken similar measures.",
                "I welcomed the advisory opinion delivered by the International Court of Justice, ICJ, in July. The request by the General Assembly for this advisory opinion was strongly supported by Ireland in December 2022, so we took a proactive role in the genesis of the advisory opinion. The Government subsequently made submissions and shared its legal analysis through written and oral submissions to the court. Ireland’s core objective in making submissions in this case was to encourage the court to clarify the rights of the Palestinian people in international law and the opinion of the court largely confirmed the Government’s legal analysis. I thought that the Attorney General made a comprehensive and robust oral presentation to the court on the question of the occupation.",
                "The advisory opinion has changed the legal context for the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018, so it was a significant moment, not just in our consideration but, we would argue at European level, in Europe's obligations in terms of responding to the ICJ's advisory opinion. The court’s principal conclusion was that Israel’s continued presence in the occupied Palestinian territory was unlawful and that it must be brought to an end as rapidly as possible. The court also identified a range of legal obligations for all states arising from that situation. These include a duty not to render aid or assistance in maintaining the illegal situation created by Israel in the occupied territories. The ICJ’s conclusions on this point were entirely consistent with the arguments made by the Attorney General on behalf of the Irish Government throughout the case.",
                "While the ICJ’s advisory opinion is not in itself legally binding, the Government accepts that it represents an authoritative statement of applicable international law, which is binding on all states and international organisations. This is the changed legal context for the Bill. What has not changed is the EU’s exclusive competence in the field of trade for all its member states, including Ireland.",
                "It was against this background that the Taoiseach asked the Attorney General to provide updated advice on the Bill. The advice provided to the Government remains that the Bill, in its present form, is incompatible with EU law and the Constitution. In its current form, it is unconstitutional. This advice reflects the conclusions also reached by this select committee in its detailed scrutiny of the Bill several years ago. The Attorney General has advised that if the EU does not take measures to limit or prevent trade with the settlements, there are exceptional grounds in EU law that could allow a member state to take measures itself. However, it is important to understand that these grounds have never been used before by a member state in similar circumstances. As a result, there remains a legal risk if we do take our own domestic measures.",
                "In light of the new context provided by the advisory opinion, the Government has decided to review the Bill and prepare amendments. The purpose of the amendments will be to try to bring the Bill into line with European Union law and the Constitution and to reduce the risk of infringement proceedings against the State. The Government has also issued the money message necessary to enable the Bill to move to Committee Stage.",
                "I stress, however, that the amendments required are not merely technical in nature. The Government’s analysis is that substantive amendment will be required to most, if not all, of the Bill’s provisions. At one stage, the Government considered whether it would table its own Bill. In fairness and in deference to the authors of the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018, the Government decided on taking the route of amending the latter. In the meantime, the Government will continue to press for action at the EU level.",
                "I thank Senator Black, the sponsor of the Bill, for her constructive engagement. I have been in regular contact with her. Officials from my Department had a very useful meeting with her and her team last week, during which they went through the Bill in detail and proposed areas for amendment. With the permission of the Chair, I will ask one of my officials to go through some of those areas later. To give an outline, we have been advised that unilateral action by any EU member state in an area of exclusive EU competence such as trade can only be justified on public policy grounds under the European Union treaties and only then in the most exceptional circumstances. Public policy grounds are exceptional grounds in European Union law that could allow a member state to take measures itself. However, in the context of the Bill, public policy grounds for taking trade measures have never been used by a member state before in a case like that. In the past, public policy grounds have only been used to justify measures taken by a member state in response to public policy considerations unique to that member state.",
                "In this case, Ireland would be adopting a measure in response to a public policy consideration, respect for international law, that applies throughout the European Union. There remains a risk, therefore, that legal action may be taken against Ireland. To justify the enactment of this Bill on the grounds of public policy, it will be necessary, for example, to limit the scope of the Bill to trade with the occupied Palestinian territory only. A Bill applying to the much broader category of all territories deemed occupied by international courts and tribunals or by Ministerial regulations could not be justified under EU law. This is because the EU has already adopted measures in relation to an occupied territory, like Crimea, for example, has not yet considered doing so, has not yet been asked to do so, etc. As a consequence, the power of the Minister to make regulations designating relevant occupied territories is, in its present form, incompatible with the Constitution and will need to be removed from the Bill.",
                "That is just by way of illustrating some of the changes required. There are other areas as well. With the permission of the Chair, I will ask Mr. Smyth to comment on them."

                "I thank the Chair and the members of the committee for the opportunity to speak. I will try to be as brief as I possibly can because I want to leave time for a discussion and questions. I am joined by Gerry Liston from Sadaka and the Global Legal Action Network, and Conor O'Neill, who is the head of policy at Christian Aid Ireland. Mr. Liston and Mr. O'Neill have worked closely with me on the drafting of the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018, along with people from a wide range of brilliant civil society organisations and activists. They have helped to move this proposed legislation forward so brilliantly. Mr. Liston and Mr. O'Neill are here to provide input regarding amendments and for any legal or technical questions.",
                "I will speak first about where we are with the Bill, the progress we have made and the work we still have to do. As we meet this afternoon in the safety of this committee room, I cannot help but think of the situation in Palestine right now. I must emphasise this point. It is the backdrop to this discussion. What is happening on the other side of the world but being broadcast to us in real time is an absolutely horrific genocide. That is what it is. Every day, I see the images, the horror and the devastation being inflicted on innocent people and children in Gaza and right across the West Bank. It is really hard to describe the despair and the anger this causes me to feel. Honestly, I just cannot believe how the world can look on and do so little. I just cannot believe it is possible. It is really beyond belief.",
                "I firmly believe that we have a responsibility to break this trend and to ensure there are finally some real consequences for Israel's flagrant and repeated violations of international law and the theft of Palestinian land. I must say that words of condemnation are not enough any more. That is why I tabled this legislation six years ago and it is why I am back before the committee today.",
                "As members will know, the Bill has a long history. It has already been passed in full by the Seanad, and the Dáil also voted overwhelmingly in favour of it. The committee undertook detailed scrutiny of the Bill in 2019 and also voted in favour. Unfortunately, despite expressing support in principle, successive Governments, at least up to now, have been unwilling to pass it based on legal advice that my team and I have long argued was wrong.",
                "I do not want to redo those legal arguments of the past six years because, to be honest, the key thing now is to ensure we can finally move on from those arguments. We have shared detailed legal opinions from some of the most eminent experts in the world setting out that Ireland can do this. We built a movement of people across Ireland demanding action and, finally, in July, the ruling of the International Court of Justice put the matter beyond any reasonable doubt. The highest court in the world made it clear that not only is banning trade with Israel's illegal settlements the right thing to do, but that it is actually a firm legal obligation for all states, including Ireland. I am happy to say that the Tánaiste, Deputy Martin, and the Taoiseach, Deputy Harris, are making this exact case now too here in Ireland and at EU level and that the Attorney General's advice has finally changed. It should not have taken this long and it is unfortunate the change has come about so late in the life of this Dáil. The ICJ ruling, however, was of great significance. If this is what can finally unlock things, then I truly welcome it.",
                "For the first time, we can truly say that all political parties have pledged to pass this legislation, alongside an incredible network of activists around the country. We have worked extremely hard to build political support and it is now unanimous. The people marching out on the streets are right. Passing this Bill was the right thing to do when I introduced it in 2018 and it is absolutely the right thing to do now. We should not waste any more time. We must focus on getting this legislation passed as soon as humanly possible with support from all sides of this House. I thank Sinn Féin, the Social Democrats, the Labour Party and People Before Profit for offering their Dail time up to try to get the Bill through its final Stages and into law this week. I still firmly believe that this is the right thing to do.",
                "As the Tánaiste said, I met with him at length on this issue and with his officials regarding amendments, which Mr. Liston and Mr. O'Neill can discuss in more detail. The key thing for me, though, is that we are talking about small technical changes to strengthen the Bill and protect it from legal challenge. I have no issue with that. We should get them done as soon as possible. If this does not happen before an election is called, then my message is clear. We will keep going. All parties have now pledged to do this and I refuse to let it be something that is promised before an election and not delivered on afterwards. I know the incredible activists and campaigners across the country will be holding every candidate, TD and party to their promises to ensure, whether it is this week or immediately as soon as new Dail convenes, that we make any final changes needed and pass this Bill into law.",
                "I take this opportunity to commend the amazing activists and NGOs for their dedication to the Palestinian cause, as well as the councillors the length and breadth of this country who have shown that local government has been to the fore in supporting the passing of this Bill. Councillors from all parties and none have not used this Bill as a political football and have unanimously passed motions in support of it.",
                "After decades of theft, dispossession and displacement, and in the context of an ongoing genocide in Gaza, this Bill is the absolute least we can do."

                "I had hoped there would be something in the Tánaiste's opening statement today that would in some way justify what I believe is, in the highest order, an unacceptable decision by his Government to further delay and frustrate the passage of the occupied territories Bill. This Bill was passed by the Dáil in January 2019. All of the arguments that the Tánaiste has outlined today in respect of the Bill were put by the then Government. The Opposition had a majority at that stage and the mover of the Bill was the Tánaiste's party; in 2019, it was a Deputy from his party who moved the Bill in the Dáil. He assured the Dáil, on behalf of Fianna Fáil, that the Bill was not taken lightly or without due consideration. I presumed that due consideration would have taken cognisance of legal advice that contradicted the position of the Department of Foreign Affairs at that point, which is the same as what the Department is outlining today.",
                "The Deputy who moved the Bill, Deputy Niall Collins, went on to say, rightly, in my view: \"No condemnation has been strong enough to change Israel's approach, and it would appear that the Israeli authorities have become accustomed to tuning out criticism.\" He then said: \"... if this is not the time to act, when will that time come?\" When, indeed? When the Tánaiste considers what we have witnessed over the past year, he should be ashamed of his party's actions in this regard. What is worse, apart from the fact the Tánaiste has refused to progress this Bill over his term in government, when he, more than any other individual, both as Taoiseach and then as Minister for Foreign Affairs, could have progressed it, but he then accuses others who are trying to progress the Bill of political games. To me, that is cynical in the extreme.",
                "It is important that people understand what the Tánaiste said before this committee today. He told us that substantive amendment needs to be made to most, if not all, of the provisions of the Bill. In fact, he directly contradicted Senator Black, who said the requirements are technical changes. He outlined to the committee that it is not technical changes that are required and that it is much more substantive than that. The Tánaiste needs to be clear what those substantive changes are and what they would mean for the occupied territories Bill. We all know that any legislation is subject to substantive amendment to most, if not all, of its provisions, and what we end up with is a Bill that is different in every respect, other than the name, from the original that was adopted by the House.",
                "I have some questions. When did the Tánaiste’s party move on this Bill? As a Minister, when did he seek that the Department would prepare the amendments necessary to overcome whatever legal issues arise? The Tánaiste said the review of the legislation was sought on the basis of the ruling of the International Court of Justice regarding the illegality of the settlements, but the Tánaiste already knew the answer to the question that was being asked of the ICJ in respect of the illegality of the Israeli settlements. He knew the answer because he sent the Attorney General to the ICJ to set out very clearly that it was Ireland's position that the settlements were illegal. It was the clear position of the Irish Government that these constituted illegal settlements.",
                "Let me ask the Tánaiste this. The ICJ, in its advisory opinion, stated clearly that states have an obligation to prevent trade with and investment in the illegal settlements. That was in July. What single act has Ireland taken in order to be in compliance with that? We have spoken about the occupied territories Bill over the past six years. We know the answer to all of this. Fine Gael did not want the occupied territories Bill and it opposed the Bill tooth and nail in this Dáil. It was beaten in the Dáil and it then introduced a money message to block it. Then, when they went into programme for government negotiations, the Tánaiste's party and the Greens gave up on the occupied territories Bill in order to secure their places at Cabinet. Throughout this term of Government, they basically just sat there and hid behind legal advice that said this was an EU competence. If this was a matter of EU law being paramount, the Government would have initiated infringement proceedings against the European Commission for not acting in respect of the EU-Israel association agreement under Article 265 of the treaty. It could have done that. Instead, it wrote a letter to the European Commission in respect of the EU-Israel association agreement, which, as far as I know, is still unanswered. Lest anyone forget, the EU-Israel association agreement was renewed again during this term of office. Therefore, Israel, rather than being penalised for its blatant disregard of international law, enjoys the most preferential trading relationship with every European Union state that it is possible to have outside of the continent of Europe.",
                "The Tánaiste says that substantive amendment to most, if not all, of the provisions of the Bill will be required. I ask him to outline precisely what that means, whether he intends that the final Bill will include services, as well as goods, in respect of banned activities and whether he will outline clearly to the electorate what particular changes he intends to make to the occupied territories Bill should he be returned to Government. That is a question the Irish people deserve an answer to."

                "That is essentially what you have asked me to do. I moved it on Second Stage. However, substantive changes are always made to Bills on Committee Stage or changes can be made. I cannot ram a Bill through that is unconstitutional. There is an obligation on us all, if we are serious about this, because this will be challenged. This could go right to the European courts, and the least we could do is produce a Bill that would be robust enough to navigate such a potential journey. That is the point. Therefore, we do have to amend it. We have to take due care to amend it.",
                "I have already mentioned the constitutional issue in terms of the power of the Minister to make regulations. That can be amended. I am not saying it cannot be amended, but it has to be amended, because it is incompatible with the Constitution at the moment. Regulation-making powers in legislation must be framed by principles and policies set down in the Act itself. In that way, a Minister, in making regulations, is merely giving effect to the principles and policies established by the Oireachtas and not making law himself or herself. The Bill has to be changed to accommodate that. While it may be possible to develop principles and policies for this regulation-making power in the Bill, the creation of such a power would amount to the exercise of an exclusive Union competence and so on in the field of trade, and would be contrary to EU law, even if it might otherwise be consistent with the Constitution.",
                "There are a lot of issues we have to go through here, namely, the definitions in section 2 of the Bill, the offences created by sections 6 to 9, inclusive, and the corresponding defences in section 11. They all need careful review. In their present form, these provisions are imprecise and lack the necessary legal certainty, a view that was also reached by the select committee's detailed scrutiny of the Bill. Additionally, significant legal and practical issues arising from the proposed extraterritorial application of the Bill will require careful consideration. It can be done. We are satisfied, we are going to do it and we will progress this, but it is not something that can be done in a short space of time because it will involve advices. The advice is not from my Department. The advice in terms of all legislation, as the Deputy knows, is the Attorney General's advice. The Government of the day has to be bound by the advices of the Attorney General. The Attorney General has not changed the advice. It is important to make that point. The Attorney General's advice on exclusive competence over trade policy by the EU stays as per the previous advices from previous Attorneys General. The advice on the unconstitutional elements of the Bill is still consistent. The issue is that the ICJ advisory opinion opens up a pathway. We need to strengthen the Bill and make it more robust to deal with any potential challenges that may come its way, potentially from the European Commission itself or from an EU member state that may want to challenge it.",

If you furnish more than ten people with that and it gets into the hands of those who might want to take a case against us, that would weaken our position collectively as a nation in defending such a Bill. That is a real consideration. I can say this much and think I have said here that the Attorney General is upfront in saying that what we are doing is not without legal risk. It is not a slam dunk. I understand where people's political heart is. There is consistency about it across Leinster House. I regret that the whole Middle Eastern issue is sometimes used as a political wedge issue in Ireland to attack Government. Ask Palestinians, the Palestinian Authority and others, Egyptians and Jordanians, and they will say that Ireland is number one in its response to the situation in the Middle East. The entire Arab world says that, but if you listen to some of the debate in Ireland, you would imagine that the Irish Government was responsible for everything that is going on. That tends to happen.",

That will feature in this conversation and debate. There will be American concerns about multinationals inadvertently getting embroiled in this. These are issues. It is not there is any influence, but these are real issues that will emerge. That is the way it is. One cannot wish them away. It is the role of embassies in Europe and other embassies to make representations to member states about how they see particular legislation. I have not met anyone personally but I have no doubt that the US ambassador could be in touch. In the past, I met officials from the US embassy when I was in opposition. What was striking on that occasion, in a meeting with an official who was not an ambassador, was that he was putting significant pressure on Fianna Fáil. I asked if he was talking to Sinn Féin and he said no. I found it striking."

The fact that he has not says to me that he cannot be trusted on this because his Government has not brought forward a single sanction against Israel despite multiple opportunities brought by the Opposition in which he could have taken some meaningful action, which he has not done. That is not to say we do not commend those actions which have been taken, because we have commended them when they have been taken. I have congratulated and thanked the Tánaiste when he has done the right thing.

The reason I want to do the Bill is because it a reflection of our opposition to the occupation and we now have the advisory opinion from the ICJ, which does actually place an obligation on us not to support the illegal occupation. There is clarity there. I do not have great hope that the Bill itself will change Israeli behaviour. What we are praying for and working on, and when I say \"we\", we have been in constant contact with the Arab nations that have been endeavouring to get a peace initiative going, is to get a ceasefire and to get some plan in place for the reconstruction of Gaza, which has been levelled. What has happened there is the collective punishment of a people. I said that earlier before the Deputy arrived to the meeting. What is happening in northern Gaza at the moment is, without question, the entire removal of a population from a territory. That seems to me to be the plan because hospitals are being bombed and there are no anaesthetics or medicines. More than 400,000 people are trapped. International organisations have said to me that what is happening in northern Gaza will haunt humanity for a long time to come. I have said we need the international community to be allowed into Gaza, and by this I mean governments and media, to bear witness to what is happening in Gaza right now and we need a surge of humanitarian aid into Gaza. This cannot happen quickly enough.",
                "I believe the vacuum in the presidential election in the USA has been a factor in the aggression and the escalation by Israel of its attacks in Gaza in particular, which are beyond any moral compass. I believe Hamas should agree to a ceasefire and release all of the hostages. What Hamas did in murdering slaughtering more that 1,200 innocent people attending concerts and such was heinous. We need to condemn that unreservedly too. Hezbollah has been a malign influence in Lebanon. It has been a state within a state. There is hardly anyone living in southern Lebanon now, with some 80,000 or 90,000 people having left. Another 90,000 have left northern Israel because of rockets going over. We need ceasefires in both locations and we need to make innocent civilians our priority in Gaza, the West Bank and Lebanon. That is where our focus is right now, to do everything we possibly can, working with other states. We can only work with other states to see if we can have an impact. I believe this country had an impact in maintaining aid to UNRWA because we stood up and gave extra money at a time when everybody else was pulling it back. We changed opinions across Europe and caused people to press the pause button and stop withdrawing funding from UNRWA. That is how I see things at the moment. We will aim to have amendments ready for the new Government."

I remember that when the first hospital was bombed in Gaza, Israel said it would look into it because even the Israelis would never bomb a hospital. Since then, they have been deliberately targeting healthcare workers and journalists. We know they were deliberately targeting women and children, and men - I do not know why men are always left out of the equation. The Palestinian men I see on my television screen are rising life and limb to save children from bombarded buildings, or are healthcare workers or are driving ambulances. They are doing their damned best to save as many lives as they can. Israel is still in violation of international law. There has been no sanction against Israel, as such. There is a feeling that this is very late in the day, that if the Government really wanted to move the occupied territories Bill forward and was really concerned about amendments, it would have brought it forward quicker. The Tánaiste met the Senator a couple of weeks ago and I will have a question for her afterwards. We are on the cusp of an election now and there will be talk about outside interference and everybody will be saying to look at Russia. At lunchtime today, The Ditch released a statement that the American ambassador wrote to the Tánaiste 90 minutes before he issued a statement committing to only a review rather than the enactment of this legislation. The Tánaiste should make a statement on this because I find it hard to believe that he is pretending now that he did not know about it."

We see it every day and every night on our screens, as with other conflicts, like in Sudan, that we mentioned previously, and obviously Ukraine, where things have gone off the charts at the moment. That is not going well either. There is terrible suffering going on there. I commend the Tánaiste on the work he has been doing to try to bring about a ceasefire, which is probably the most important thing and where we should be putting all our energies now and using every avenue we can to bring about a ceasefire as soon as possible. I would like to know what is happening at European level with other governments to put pressure on to bring about a complete ceasefire and the cessation of killing and violence on all sides. That should be our number one target.",

I know from being in Ministries before that you have to be very careful with amendments and you have to make sure they are correct because if you get them wrong, you will be in serious trouble and you will be back where you started or even worse. I encourage that the amendments be brought forward as soon as possible and that they would be passed by all. I just want to ensure we do not lose sight of the bigger picture, which is a complete and total ceasefire and the stopping of the killing and the slaughter of men, women and children on all sides. The release of hostages, as was said earlier, has to happen. Let us get humanitarian aid in there as quickly as possible. There are people starving in those countries at the moment. We are talking about €1 million worth of goods coming into Europe. We should be trying to find ways of stopping people from starving in Gaza and now in Lebanon. I dealt with the Syrian issue, as did the Cathaoirleach. Syrians had to leave and now we will probably see Lebanese having to leave and Lebanese refugees. This is another catastrophe facing us. This is extraordinarily serious. The far bigger picture here is to get a ceasefire as soon as possible. We should all unite on this straight away. I will not be here for too long more with an election in a couple of days but every time I look at this I think it is just shocking and appalling on all sides.",

She brought forward the Bill at a time when things were far less fraught - infinitely less - than they are now. Things were not good but what is happening there now is apocalyptic. It is just shocking. The whole of Gaza has been levelled, as was said. South Lebanon is facing the same thing, a most beautiful part of the world which should be booming with tourism and so on. Many of us have been there and have see, this happen. It is ghastly. It is biblical, virtually. That is where we should be putting our energies. Let us stop the squabbling and the point scoring. This is far too serious for point scoring from any side. That is what I want to say on this matter.",

That was not the suggestion. The suggestion was, and the frustration stems from the fact that, the Department had time previous to this where it could have been developing the amendments and it did not. It seems like the departmental staff now has a good handle on what sort of amendments could be brought forward. If there is still time, it is important. I presume the Tánaiste has been working on this since October. We have had the intervention in the ICJ since July. I do not believe for a second that two days would have been enough allocated to this but I have confidence in the Department officials that they have given this the regard it deserves. With the good framing the Tánaiste has outlined, perhaps there is still the opportunity to bring the amendments to some parts so that we could advance the Bill before the Dáil folds. That is really important. I do not think anyone gave the impression that this would stop not the war but the annihilation that is being inflicted upon the people of Gaza. What it does do and where it is important is that it demonstrates consequence, and that is something that would take action."

                "Draft agreements have been tabled in respect of the Lebanon situation. People are working flat out in respect of Gaza, but political will is always required on the part of both Israel and Hamas to sign a deal and agree a ceasefire deal that would give some respite to the people of Gaza and allow hostages to be released. Again, Ireland is working on this. We have very close relationships with, and were involved in helping, the Arab nations with suggestions from a European perspective on the Arab peace initiative. Unfortunately, it did not get the traction it should have in the US and elsewhere. It looked at all the issues, including Israeli long-term security concerns, which are very real, given what happened on 7 October. It also looked at a Palestinian administration in Gaza, getting aid into Gaza and getting some sense of governance there. However, the level of reconstruction that will be required is on a massive scale. The Deputy put it very well.",
                "The opinion was issued in July. In relative terms, we outlined in our discussions with Senator Black approximately 12 areas that have been suggested, some of which overlap and need amendment and consideration. If the Deputy's party needs a briefing at some stage with our Department, that can be provided, but it is not possible to do it in two or three days. I think the Deputy accepted that. It simply is not possible to do it in two or three days. It needs significant consideration. The Attorney General's opinion is lengthy and quite comprehensive. There has been some illustration of that from the French case. We are, to a certain extent, moving into a unique legal position with this. The ICJ enables us to do that. That is the point. It enables us to go forward. The essential argument we are making is that the ICJ has placed obligations on us as a nation not to do anything that would aid the illegality of the occupation. The ICJ states that in its opinion. I think Deputy Carthy was saying that we knew what the position was. We did not know what the ICJ advisory opinion was because the Attorney General was making an oral submission to the court and giving our perspective to the court. I wanted to clarify that point. It is not as if we knew before the court. The whole purpose of that started as a UN resolution that Ireland strongly supported and worked on with the Palestinian authority. We then made a written submission and an oral submission to the court. There is some credit to Ireland for being consistent in using the international legal forum as it is to push this issue.",
                "We have also co-sponsored a UN resolution asking the UN General Assembly to take steps to implement the ICJ advisory opinion at UN level. If we are honest, the problem is that legal processes by their definition are one area for action. The other areas are diplomatic, political and economic."

Obviously, nobody will disagree with that. The difficulty is where we lay the responsibility because any sanctions that have been applied have been applied on individual settlers, and rightly so. However, it is not individual settlers who are responsible for the illegal settlements; it is the Israeli state that facilitates them. Therefore, in line with the ICJ opinion that stated that all states must prevent both trade and investment in the illegal settlements, are our guests of the view that Ireland has done anything to meet our obligations in that respect? Are there things including but also beyond the occupied territories Bill that we would need to do in order to be in compliance with that?",

It is a very good opportunity, from our perspective, if an election is called in a couple of days, to try to set the record as straight as we can possibly get it at this point. This is so that in the context of an election campaign, some of the issues that have been raised can be put on the parliamentary record and discussed, and we can try to bring as much clarity as we can. We are very grateful for the opportunity to be here. I also sincerely thank Senator Black. A big, wide and vibrant network of academics, activists and civil society organisations have supported and contributed to the Bill. Mr. Liston and I are glad to get the opportunity to speak to some of the more technical or legal points that have been raised.",
                "I will talk about three things specifically: the question of the amendments; the provisions of the Bill that deal with services; and the prospect of a legal challenge and what that might mean. On the question of amendments, and Deputy Gannon raised this, it is important to say that many of the questions that have been raised are not new. They were in fact identified and raised by the very helpful and detailed pre-legislative scrutiny that the committee did in 2019. Mr. Liston and I, and a broad range of academics and lawyers from a number of Irish universities, disagree on the fundamental EU law question. That has been very well ventilated over a number of years. We engaged with some of the issues raised in good faith and took a lot of time to try to begin work on potential amendments that could strengthen those provisions and protect the Bill from legal challenge. We very much recognise that.",
                "We never got a chance to advance any of that draft text or amendments because the money message was not provided and the Bill did not come to the committee.",
                "On some of the issues being raised today, it is important to say work has been done. We, along with the officials in the Department and the political parties, have been aware of them since at least 2019. In that respect, many of the amendments that have been discussed here and previously are not enormously challenging. It is a question of trying to put in the necessary time. We absolutely do not want to rush to get wording that the various Government Departments, the sponsoring Senators, the Government and the officials are happy with.",
                "One of the issues raised is the scope of the Bill. When we worked with Senators initially on the research for and the drafting of the Bill, we did it deliberately so that it could potentially be universal in its application and could apply to any occupied territory anywhere in the world, if there were support from within the Oireachtas and clarity from international courts or other legal bodies. We still believe that that principle is correct and important because, whether it is the parts of Ukraine that are occupied by Russia, which we have already implemented measures like this in relation to, and rightly so, or Western Sahara, which the Tánaiste mentioned, we believe that the same standard should apply. We set out in detail previously why we believe that such a ban would be permissible under EU law. Having said that, we have heard the presentation from the Government and the legal officials. I agree with the remarks of the Chair about the Attorney General's advice.",
                "In the course of the debate on this Bill, we have published or shared formal legal opinion or advice from Professor Panos Koutrakos and Professor Takis Tridimas, two experts in legal law, Senator Michael McDowell, a former Attorney General, the late Professor James Crawford, a former judge of the ICJ, Mr. Michael Lynn, a senior counsel in Ireland, Dr. John Reynolds, an academic in Maynooth University, and Dr. Tom Moerenhout, an academic who works with Dr. Reynolds across EU level. We have been doing that a little bit in the dark, trying to set forward our position on the EU law question without having sight of the specifics of the Attorney General's opinion. Any work that could be done to put the new advice and information in front of this committee and in the public realm would be really welcome.",
                "In setting those advices out, we are cognisant of the fact that what has been raised is that it seems the new advice hinges primarily and the ICJ advisory opinion delivered in July. If the Government's intention is to as closely as possible give effect to the ICJ advisory opinion, then the intention would be to redraft the scope of the Bill to apply specifically to the occupied Palestinian territories as was done regarding Russian imports previously. If that was done, the main constitutional arguments that have also been raised would, by default, cease to apply. For example, one of the most significant constitutional questions raised in 2019 and again today relates to sections 3 and 4 of the Bill and the delegation of power by the Oireachtas to a Minister or an international court, which is necessary under the Bill as drafted to designate a territory as occupied for the purposes of the Act and the limits that are set by Article 15.2 of the Constitution. For the avoidance of doubt, we believe the Bill as drafted is consistent with the approach to the non-delegation doctrine set out by the Supreme Court in Cityview Press. However, the relevant definitions and the delegation of power would not be necessary if the Bill is redrafted as the Government has suggested to apply specifically to the OPT. Some of the other constitutional questions that have been raised, for example, the precision in the offences and the addition of extra defences in section 11 or 12, are really a question of an important but limited amount of legal work across Departments to land on appropriate language. I am encouraged to hear that is progressing.",
                "We would have a direct ask, in good faith, of every member of this committee and of the Government. The Parliament will empty over the next few weeks, over the month of November, for the election. Perhaps in December, we will be talking about negotiating a new programme for Government. That gives us two months to do that work, so that when a new Dáil is formed and a new Government takes office in January, we have a set of primarily technical amendments that can strengthen and improve the Bill that could be handed to a new Government and then obviously it is its prerogative to accept and table them in conjunction with the sponsoring Senators. That is the first and primary ask we have and it is encouraging to hear there seems to be agreement on it.",
                "My second point is in relation to services, which is a question Deputy Carthy raised and it is crucially important. When we look at what the ICJ said in the advisory opinion of 19 July, when the ICJ talks about trade that means trade in physical goods and services. That is how trade is always understood within this Parliament and basically every facet of the Irish system. When the CSO, for example, sets out Ireland’s annual trade statistics, or our trade balance with another country, that is the value of all physical goods and services imported or exported over a particular period. That should not be controversial in the slightest but we want to put it on the record and it might just be a case of loose language at various times but any suggestion that giving effect to our obligations, as clarified by the ICJ, would involve just a ban on physical goods and not on services would be completely wrong. The ICJ was clear that states are obliged to prohibit trade. Any distinction between physical goods on the one hand and services on the other would be arbitrary both politically and legally. That was the approach rightly taken on the prohibition of certain economic activity, both trade in goods and services and investment as regards to the Ukrainian territory occupied by Russia. Mr. Liston will speak more about the question of investment."

It is important to recall the language the court used in defining those obligations – first, to abstain from entering into economic or trade dealings with the settlements and, second, to take steps to prevent trade or investment relations that assist the maintenance of illegal occupation. There was a report published in October of this year by the UN Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and Israel which gave a legal interpretation of the ICJ advisory opinion and essentially it interprets these obligations to mean that states most cease all financial trade, investment and economic relations with Israel that maintain the unlawful occupation or contribute to maintaining it.",
                "If Ireland is to comply with the obligation outlined by the ICJ, the Government and the Oireachtas will have to address investment links to the Israeli settlements in addition to trade in goods and services, as mentioned by Mr. O’Neill. We are aware of the Illegal Israeli Settlements Divestment Bill and the important work that has been done on that but it is important to note that that Bill only addresses public investment in companies operating in the settlements, in particular investment by the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund. However, it is clear the obligations set out by the ICJ are concerned with the prevention of public and private investment. This is, as Mr. Liston touched on, entirely consistent with how Ireland and other EU member states have acted in relation to Russian occupied territory in Ukraine. For example, the relevant EU regulations which have been implemented into Irish law by statutory instrument prevent financial or other investment services linked to entities operating in the relevant territories such as Crimea. It is really important the committee considers this when it reconvenes to look at this Bill and the Illegal Israeli Settlements Divestment Bill.",

However, as I said, we will look at trade, services and investments to ensure that the full gamut of obligations, as identified by the ICJ, are implemented by those amendments."

It is obviously a matter for the new Government to order its priorities and for Parliament to refer the matter to this committee. One thing is for sure; I will not be here and others may not be either. That brings me to a concluding comment. I thank Senator Black, Mr. O'Neill and Mr. Liston. All of the commentary will be on the record, which is important for future committee. I thank the Tánaiste for his work and time. I also thank his officials, in particular Mr. Smyth, for coming in and outlining to us not only the nature of the issue, but the manner in which solutions will be forged. I accept the legal team in the Department of Foreign Affairs has been working on this for quite some time. I am sure even Deputy Carthy will acknowledge the complexities involved in order to ensure that anything that is presented is done in such a way as to be robust."

                "I thank the Cathaoirleach and members for the opportunity to be here this afternoon. I am here to engage on six Supplementary Estimates proposed for Votes under the Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform Vote group. I will detail the requirements for each Vote but, in summary, they comprise a technical Supplementary Estimate of €1,000 for Vote 11; a technical Supplementary Estimate of a net €1,000 and gross €22.1 million for Vote 12 – Superannuation and Retired Allowances; a technical Supplementary Estimate for a net €1,000 and a gross €120,000 for Vote 14 – State Laboratory; a technical Supplementary Estimate for a net €1,000 and a gross €665,000 for Vote 17 – Public Appointments Service; a technical Supplementary Estimate of a token €1,000 for Vote 18 – National Shared Services Office; and a technical Supplementary Estimate of a token €1,000 for Vote 19 – Office of the Ombudsman. Altogether, the proposed Supplementary Estimates would result in an increased allocation of €6,000 in net terms and €22.9 million in gross terms across the six Votes. A further Supplementary Estimate under the ministerial Vote group is being sought for the Office of Public Works. My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, will speak to that.",
                "With regard to Vote 11, we are seeking a technical Supplementary Estimate to allow for the transfer of funding between departmental subheads. This is to ensure that adequate funding is available for programme A16, which relates to pensions for bodies under the aegis of the Department, particularly the ESRI, the IPA and the Office of the Regulator of the National Lottery. As public servants are only required to give one month's notice of retirement, it is difficult to forecast the cost of lump sums and pensions. In 2024, it is expected that €612,000 extra will be required in programme A16. No additional funding is required in 2024 other than the token amount of €1,000 as there are savings within programme A1, which relates to salaries, wages, pensions and allowances, that can offset this expected overspend. The 2025 estimate for pensions for bodies under the aegis of the Department has increased from €1.536 million to €2.206 million to mitigate any potential future overspends.",
                "With regard to Vote 12 – Superannuation and Retired Allowances, this is for a net amount of €1,000 and will, if agreed, allow the Vote to utilise additional appropriations-in-aid to fund projected expenditure. The receipts for appropriations-in-aid are higher than forecast due to greater than expected contributions on subhead B7, single public service pension scheme. This proposal utilises additional appropriations-in-aid and will increase the gross ceiling of Vote 12 by €21.1 million. The technical Supplementary Estimate in respect of the superannuation Vote will bring the total 2024 Estimate for that Vote to €891.7 million gross and €225.4 million net. This Estimate arises due to a higher number of retirements than expected for 2024. This has resulted in costs under the pension scheme for established civil servants being higher than forecast. Expenditure in this regard is dependent on the number and grade mix of those who retire, and varies year to year.",
                "The Supplementary Estimate for Vote 14 is for a net amount of €1,000 and will allow the Vote to utilise appropriations-in-aid, in addition to savings in salaries, wages, pensions and allowances, to fund higher than expected electricity and gas costs. Savings in subhead A1 arise as a result of delays in recruitment of staff in the first half of the year while appropriations-in-aid are due to a higher number of tests completed and billed in 2024, and this will result in an increase in the gross ceiling of Vote 14 by €122,000.",
                "A technical Supplementary Estimate is sought for the Public Appointments Service. This is again for a net amount of €1,000 and will allow the Vote to utilise appropriations-in-aid to fund the delivery of enhanced recruitment for An Garda Síochána. In 2024, PAS and An Garda Síochána agreed that PAS would facilitate a process for enhanced Garda recruitment on the basis that An Garda Síochána agreed to transfer €664,000 to PAS. This, therefore, requires a technical Supplementary Estimate which will result in an increase in the gross ceiling of Vote 17 by €664,000.",
                "The Supplementary Estimate for Vote 18 – National Shared Services Office is a technical Supplementary Estimate of €1,000 to provide for the reallocation of funding within the Vote to areas experiencing pressures. The Supplementary Estimate will allow for €7.295 million in savings across a number of programme areas to be allocated mainly to address pressures arising within the area of enterprise IT. Given the nature of the office, the NSSO is a significant consumer of IT related services and costs in this area have been increasing year on year.",
                "A technical Supplementary Estimate of €1,000 is sought for Vote 19 – Office of the Ombudsman to provide for the reallocation of funding within the Vote to areas experiencing pressures. It will provide scope for the office to increase the legal fees subhead by €710,000 in 2024 to meet the cost of legal fees and settlements which are expected to fall due towards the end of the financial year.

                "As Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, I am here today to propose a Supplementary Estimate for the office.",
                "While the OPW’s net Estimate for 2024 on Vote 13 is €624 million, profiled expenditure for the year indicates an expected excess of €40.336 million on capital expenditure and €15.624 million on current expenditure. When account is taken of expected savings on the Vote of €5.611 million, the net overall request for a Supplementary Estimate for Vote 13 is €50.349 million.",
                "An additional amount of just over €40 million on capital expenditure is due to a number of factors. Approximately half of the sum required, €20.336 million, is to fund the data centre project in Backweston. When the national development plan allocations for the period 2021 to 2030 were agreed by Government in 2021, the estimated cost of the project was €57 million and this was provided for in the OPW’s multi-annual NDP allocation. Prior to going to tender, the Department of Public Expenditure, NDP Delivery and Reform was advised by the OPW that the pre-tender estimate had reached €80 million. The Department agreed in November 2022 that any additional funding required would be provided when it fell due and authorised the OPW to proceed with the procurement competition for the delivery of the project.",
                "This project is also partly funded by the EU under the national recovery and resilience plan with an allocation of €40 million being provided from that source. That is 50% of the value of the contract. The data centre is on schedule to be completed in mid-2025. It will replace a number of older centres that are no longer fit for purpose and will facilitate the continued development of digital services across government. The new facility will also be more energy efficient than the existing centres, thus making a valuable contribution to meeting the Government’s climate action targets to reduce the State’s carbon footprint. This is the latest important infrastructural development that has been located at the Backweston campus following on from the recently completed Forensic Science Laboratory that was formally opened earlier this year. The successful completion of the data centre project represents a further tangible demonstration of the Government’s commitment under the national development plan to provide the critical infrastructure the State needs to deliver services into the future.",
                "The remaining €20 million sought for capital expenditure includes €6 million for RePowerEU related expenditure on a major refurbishment project at the OPW’s former offices at 6 Ely Place, Dublin 2. A further €9 million of EU funding will be provided during 2025 towards the €35 million overall cost of this project, so €50 million of the overall cost is provided from the EU. It is scheduled for completion by the end of 2025. At that point, it will facilitate the consolidation of a number of areas of the Department of Justice in the State-owned office accommodation complex that extends from Nos. 51 and 52 St Stephen’s Green to Ely Place. A key feature of the project's design was to make better use of the space available, resulting in an increase in available workspaces from 300 to 380. A significant upgrade of the building fabric will improve the energy efficiency of the building in alignment with Government policy on climate action to reduce the State’s carbon footprint in its buildings.",
                "A further €7 million relates to the fit-out of Smithfield Hall, also known as the Distillers Building. The OPW has taken out a 25-year lease on this modern, energy-efficient and strategically located building in the Smithfield area of Dublin, close to public transport and other major State offices, and will provide almost 1,000 workstations. The total project budget is estimated at €60 million. When the works are completed during 2025, the building will be the headquarters of Tailte Éireann, which has been created through an amalgamation of the Valuation Office, Ordnance Survey Ireland and the Property Registration Authority. The building will also accommodate the Valuation Tribunal, the Insolvency Service, and the Chief State Solicitor’s Office. When the building is completed and occupied, it will enable the OPW to exit other poor quality accommodation and make these State-owned buildings available for refurbishment and other State uses.",
                "The €7 million balance of the €20 million is required for a new build on Leeson Lane which will provide a modern, energy-efficient office block in a strategically important location at an overall cost of €50 million. The project is expected to be completed by the end of 2024 with staff moving into the building on a phased basis commencing in quarter 1 of 2025. The main occupier of this new State-owned building will be the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media. Some staff from the Department of Finance will also be accommodated in the building. The building will provide 350 workstations in a predominantly open-plan environment with minimal use of cellular offices to meet the requirements of the occupying Departments in a cost-efficient manner.",
                "These four key projects are being delivered on time and within the budgets and programmes agreed following tendering for the works involved. They represent a combined investment of €225 million in important State infrastructure that is essential for the effective delivery of public services.",
                "The requirement for non-capital expenditure is €15.624 million which is net of a projected increase of €3.569 million in appropriations-in-aid for 2024.",
                "A figure of €3.9 million is required for a number of pay items. These include a provision of €1.6 million toward the overall cost to the organisation of implementing the public service pay agreement, which had not been finalised in time for its provisions to be reflected accurately in the Revised Estimates Volume for 2024 when it was published late last year. A further €1.4 million relates to the cost of staff who are working on the Rosslare Europort project, which was previously funded from the Brexit adjustment reserve, BAR. BAR funding is no longer available to meet these staff costs and, accordingly, €1.4 million is required under the A1 pay subhead. The balance of €900,000 is required to fund the backfilling of vacancies and the staffing required to deliver OPW services.",
                "An allocation of €408,000 is required to fund an increase in subsistence rates in 2024 to cover rising costs for operational services, encompassing supplies and sundries equipment and rising costs for digital investment and IT expenses. The latter covers software licences and additional contract staff hours in the ICT area. An additional €1.39 million is required in the arterial drainage area due to a number of factors, including the increased cost of carrying out essential maintenance works driven by fuel costs and general construction cost inflation, as well as the need to fund the cost of unexpected significant and essential environmental and archaeological survey costs. Ongoing engineer recruitment challenges have also resulted in a requirement to engage contract engineers to ensure essential works can continue.",
                "The modest increase in the OPW's non-capital allocation for 2024 of 1.5% did not adequately cover the expected increase in the OPW’s cost base at the time when the 2024 Estimate was settled. As a result, estate management requires additional funds to cover the cost of inflation and increases in the number of buildings moving to maintenance. Several high-tech buildings, now coming under the B7 property maintenance budget, have significantly higher than usual maintenance costs. In addition, increases in insurance costs means that the overall requirement for estate management comes to just under €13.5 million. As I noted earlier, there are savings of €5.611 million available that will partially offset these costs.",
                "In summary, the overall amount of the Supplementary Estimate required for both current and capital purposes is €50.349 million. I commend them to the House."

That is because the number of cases the office is involved in varies. The settlement period for cases is difficult to predict as well. While it is possible to predict with some accuracy what our legal costs are going to be, it is difficult to predict what could be the costs of adverse outcomes from legal activity the Ombudsman is involved in.",

First, the Office of the Ombudsman has delivered and developed its own legal services unit, which provides legal advice on the exercise of statutory functions. Second, the office has moved the negotiation of the amount of opposition costs to the State Claims Agency once an award of costs has been made by the court. As the Deputy knows, the activities of the Ombudsman are entirely separate to my own Department, as they should be. In my answer to the Deputy, I have tried to outline the challenges in predicting the costs and the actions that have been taken to contain those costs over time."

Even after the pandemic had lifted, however, some Departments still had difficulty spending their full capital budgets. For the past two years, that has been a thing of the past, as is again the case for this year. If I were to say whether this is having a benefit, I would say it definitely is and I would point to new school buildings, the roll-out of the national broadband plan and extensions to certain hospitals as the most tangible examples of the difference it has made."

Second, we have made changes to the level of our capital budgets whereby, in many cases, we have had to allocate additional money to projects simply because they are costing more, given that the cost of building them has increased due to inflation.

We looked at it in great detail and it is designed in a way whereby the council provides an independent assessor to look at the home or business. From that, reports come back and the council is involved in two elements. The council goes out to tender on Irish and European sites on the basis that one of the features that came back to us was that there may not be sufficient supply within the domestic market for individual property protection measures. We are dealing with the supply issue and, in terms of value for money, going out to tender. The council will then engage contractors to install them. This is a huge body of work in Midleton.",
                "Schemes will take time because there are processes such as environmental ones that have to be gone through. I am very keen on interim measures. We put quite a number into Midleton and the surrounding areas such as Rathcormac, Mogeely and Castlemartyr. Deputy O'Connor will be very familiar with these. More recently I have been to Bantry and we are looking at the issues there. There is a mains scheme and there is also a culvert, which is in a very bad state of repair, going through the town. We are looking at ways to expedite its repair. That will go for planning by Cork County Council very shortly. We are also looking at interim measures. We have had two meetings with Cork County Council over the last few weeks. We have a further meeting scheduled tomorrow. The OPW chairs an interdepartmental flood policy co-ordination group. At the most recent meeting, I invited all the local authorities to attend to discuss flood preparedness. The CEOs and directors of services of the local authorities attended and we discussed the supports they required and their readiness. They assured me that they were ready. One of the key elements that came out of the meeting was communication. With Storm Ashley Galway City Council did a great body of work. The council did a huge amount of communication in a timely manner on road closures and road openings. Having dealt with the local authorities and our own staff in the OPW, I am satisfied that we are taking very co-ordinated measures on flood relief schemes.",

Second, we have to see if we can bring interim measures prior to the main scheme being ready. That is a key feature for me. In Bantry, this involves progressing work on the culvert project prior to the main project. In Midleton, it means putting in interim measures. I am satisfied that the process in place is robust. We must remember that we have to be true to people. When the schemes go ahead, we must be certain they are robust and fit for purpose. If it transpires that a scheme goes to judicial review, it must be able to withstand that.

Householders and farmers have been discommoded severely in going about their business. They have been discommoded in not being able to live in their homes in some cases. They have been discommoded by virtue of the roads that have to be closed off. Who pays for all this in the final analysis? For example, if the judicial review was sufficiently grounded to cause the scheme to be abandoned and restarted, who is to blame for all of that? Is it the case that the local people should not have been living there in the first place, as someone tried to tell me at one stage? That does not wash with the local people. At this stage, the local people are asking how long more must this go on. I acknowledge that the Minister of State said that it is in process but the process is taking an inordinate amount of time for the people who have been directly and negatively affected."

When I looked at this I realised it would take a period of time, with process. Working with my officials and with the support of the Taoiseach, I made a decision to put an interim measure in place for the people of Lough Funshinagh. The Deputy will appreciate my reticence because there is an application before the board at the moment for an interim measure to deal with the situation in Lough Funshinagh until the planning permission for the main scheme goes through.

People are dealing with the trauma of that. I acknowledge the enormous contribution made by our emergency services locally and by the responders on the county council who worked around the clock this time last year to get people back on their feet and back into their homes where possible. That was a long process over many months for hundreds of homeowners and business owners in the area. As I am sure the Minister of State will know, Cork County Council has worked diligently wherever it can from an engineering point of view, on an interim basis, working with community stakeholders, local county councillors, me as a Dáil Deputy for the people of east Cork, and the Minister of State. I acknowledge that the Minister of State took the time to come to us on so many occasions. Not many do that on a repeat basis, but Deputy O'Donnell did, and that needs to be said.",

Yesterday, we had a meeting of the council engineers to go through, in committee, some of the emergency responses pertaining to the OPW. These are valid questions. People need the reassurance. We have seen €5.8 million allocated under what is now the largest ever individual property protection, IPP, scheme. It is envisaged to protect about 920 homes and businesses in the area affected by Storm Babet.",

Is it worth that level of scrutiny for some of the homeowners who have shown, in photography, water coming right up to their porches and doors? In some cases, these people managed to get home on time. They worked their hearts out to get small, interim measures done, with makeshift barriers and sandbagging of their homes. They have seen their applications turned down. Could the Minister of State look at this? It takes from the enormous work that is being done by the county council. He knows that. He has been there. He has seen the work that has been put in by the director of services, John Slattery, our county engineer. Could we look at marginally increasing the budget to deal with a number of extra cases, which would be less than 100? It is so limited. Is it worth doing what we can so that it is done and provides a sense of reassurance to those people?"

If I have learned one thing from the short time I have been in the OPW, it is that we must look at interim measures. These measures could take different forms such as in Moore's Bridge in Midleton and in Lough Funshinagh. I ask Cork County Council to look at Rathcormac, which I have committed to visit. The scheme is already there in Castlemartyr. In many cases, these measures can be put in place much more quickly than what would be deemed a larger scheme and can be hugely effective in protecting people's homes in much shorter periods of time. Tranches 1 and 2 come out of the CFRAM, study. In fairness, I take the Deputy's point. It is something we look at on a continuous basis. Castlemartyr has been approved for a minor works scheme and Cork County Council should look at Rathcormac for the same issue. Work is ongoing in Mogeely at looking at options to protect people's homes. The point the Deputy has made is a valid one and I take it on board. I ask the Deputy to look at the minor works scheme as well. It has connotations of being temporary but in many cases it is highly effective in protecting homes and businesses."

Nobody can fault him for his sincerity and the follow-ups he has done on his visits. I know some people will be angered by me saying this but on the whole, as Ministers go, the Minister of State has been very diligent in being responsive to questions on these issues in the Dáil. This needs to be acknowledged but I want to make this point once more: when a scheme has been sitting there since 2018, it is a bit like telling a community that a new bus is coming but the engine is missing. It has been sitting there idle when it could be put in place and done with a limited amount of funding in comparison to what is required for major schemes. We are not talking about something of the complexity of the Midleton flood relief scheme, which is trying to protect against fluvial and tidal flooding. It is not at the mouth of a river; it is on top of a hill. It requires drainage channels to be dug. We also need to look at the potential impacts of drainage in the village. Castlemartyr is probably more complex than Rathcormac but both of them are stuck in the CFRAM tranche 2 and have been there for some time. I come from Killeagh, which flooded for the first time in recorded history during Storm Babet. I do not underestimate the seriousness of Storm Babet. It changed the landscape totally. People who know Killeagh and east Cork from walking Glenbower Wood and other areas can see that the storm physically changed the land in the area. The tranche 2 schemes have been sitting there a long time. It has gone from people being patient to having legitimate concerns about the length of time these schemes are taking."

It has been stalled within the Department. I know one could say that this is a matter for the Minister for Health but it is unfair that they have gone through a process, got to the end of it and now it is not being paid.

I recommend looking at the original tender, which was far less than €42 million. I am not saying this to embarrass anyone but we should explain to people how it can move from €4 million or €5 million to €42 million. It is worth showing the record of how that project was delivered. It was a fantastic scheme, even though there was a huge difference from start to finish. That would help people to understand. In Kilkenny during that project, the River Nore was diverted and trucks forming part of the construction team were driving up and down the bed of the river. There is a record of it. It explains how these jumps in cost can occur. The Minister of State tries to justify the cost by saying it saved 200 properties but he is not doing himself justice; it saved an awful lot more than that.

As Minister of State at the Department of Finance, I will be discussing one of the four Votes within the finance group of Votes, namely, Vote 9 - Office of the Revenue Commissioners. I look forward to a fruitful and positive exchange.",
                "The Office of the Revenue Commissioners plays a vital role in our economy by collecting taxes and duties due to the State. In 2023, Revenue collected a record €127.9 billion in gross receipts against total administrative costs of €585.1 million.",
                "The UK's departure from the European Union has had a major impact on Irish businesses and necessitated a shift in trade patterns, supply chains and the system of customs and other controls. The Revenue Commissioners and other State agencies are required by law to comply with customs controls, sanitary and phytosanitary checks and regulations in respect of goods moving between the United Kingdom and Ireland. The advent of such checks has necessitated investment in our ports and the need to replace temporary facilities with permanent infrastructure.",
                "The infrastructure at Rosslare Europort is being developed by the Office of Public Works on behalf of Revenue and other Departments and agencies. The permanent infrastructure project consists of the construction of terminal 7, enabling works and a new border control post. The works consist of various phases of construction that will deliver new and improved facilities, entry and exit access, and significant upgrading of the infrastructure across several areas. The total cost for the Rosslare project is €236 million inclusive of VAT. Costs are being apportioned across the relevant Departments and agencies. The apportionment ratio in respect of the Revenue Commissioners is 34.4%, with Revenue's total portion over the lifetime of the project expected to cost €81.3 million. The funding requirements for the remainder of 2024 for Rosslare are €17.2 million.",
                "Also included in the Supplementary Estimate is funding for the continued detention of the MV Matthew. It was seized in October 2023 and it has since been held at the Port of Cork in connection with ongoing court proceedings against eight persons who have been charged in relation to the seizure of more than 2,253 kg of cocaine from the vessel. In order to meet the remaining Rosslare infrastructure costs along with funding for the continued detention of the MV Matthew, a Supplementary Estimate of just under €20 million is required by the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.",
                "I thank members for their attention. I commend the 2024 substantive and technical Supplementary Estimate for the Revenue Commissioners to the committee and I am happy to address any questions that members may have."

There are individuals, and I would say businesses now, that are known to Revenue that sell single cigarettes. Likewise, when on looks at the trade across the Border, there is an amount of fuel, both coal and diesel, but particularly coal, coming in. The Minister of State has probably met the merchants' representative group. They constantly complain, and provide figures to back this up, that Revenue and the local authorities have not cracked down on the illegal transactions taking place. That is a huge concern. A lot of the highly populated areas here in Dublin almost have a shop selling illegal cigarettes. I cannot match that with the loss of revenue to the State and the need for more scanners.

Fuel smuggling across the Border remains a concern, however, in terms of solid fuel and red and green diesel. That is a long-standing issue we have encountered. We have also seen quite a number of diesel washing plants busted over the past year. We continue to invest it. Every request for additional funding that has been received will be met. It is not necessarily just about funding, but this is chasing an illicit activity that requires that continuing increase in investment and resources. Of course, our doors are always open to any representative bodies or individual traders who are aware of this activity. We make sure the Revenue Commissioners, other agencies and State bodies are fully funded to ensure they can chase this activity down as best possible. Indeed, I put the appeal out to any individuals who are aware of illegal cigarette sales, individual cigarette sales or whatever they may be that this is illegal activity which should be reported to An Garda Síochána first and foremost."

I am highlighting it here because my background was in retail at one stage, and I understand the margins are tight, as is the regulation. Yet, we have these illegal activities going on affecting people and their family businesses. We have to do everything we possibly can to stop them.

In this case, Revenue went back a multiple of that and brought the man to court as a kind of test case. I asked the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, and I now ask the Minister of State, to look at that case, and, where appropriate, bring forward the necessary legislation to ensure the four-year rule is protected, because businesses and the Law Society are concerned about the outcome of that case and the impact it will have in the future because it was a test case. This man has now been left to pay all of his legal costs, even though he paid his taxes and everything. He was found, in some cases, to be right in what he did and was not trying to do anything illegal, but Revenue wanted to prove a point so that, presumably, it can apply that precedent everywhere. It is an issue. People are very concerned about raising it because it might seem like tax fraud; it is not. It is a real concern for businesses, and I ask the Minister of State to look at that with the Revenue chairman.",
                "It is very difficult to engage with Revenue's public offices. Some of them are not open or do not open and it is hard to get people on the phone. That is not the case for a public representative, however, as a good service is in place. For ordinary citizens, however, who want to engage on their issues with Revenue, it is a concern that the public office facility is not more available to those who have a concern. I am raising these issues with the Minister of State because they have been raised at meetings of this committee and elsewhere. I ask the Minister of State to take note of them."

                "I thank the committee for making time available today to consider this request for Supplementary Estimates. I am seeking a Supplementary Estimate a €400,000 for the Central Statistics Office in respect of Vote 4; €4.667 million for the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in respect of Vote 5; and €3.58 million for the Chief State Solicitor's Office. A detailed briefing of each of these Votes has been supplied to the committee in advance of the meeting.",
                "In relation to the Central Statistics Office, the CSO, is Ireland’s national statistical institute and is an independent office under the Statistics Act 1993. It is responsible for the production, co-ordination and qualitative oversight of official statistics in Ireland. The CSO provides independent statistical information to support and promote understanding and debate across Government, business and society.",
                "Turning to the CSO's supplementary request, the CSO is currently projecting a gross additional need of €1.73 million. The pressure on the Vote is driven by several elements. The projected overspend in subhead A1 - salaries, wages and allowances - is due in the main to the underfunding of the 2024 pay increases and an ambitious and early recruitment schedule in 2024. Additional requirements are projected in respect of subhead A3 - training and development; subhead A4 - operational services, supplies and sundry equipment; and subhead A7 - policy reviews, consultancy services and research.",
                "In relation to the training and development subhead, the organisational capability review of the CSO completed earlier this year noted the importance of the CSO investing in training to meet statistical and administrative skills needs and to meet skills needs in new specialist and developing areas such as artificial intelligence, AI; geographic information systems; cybersecurity; and data science and data analysis. The demands for training are continuing to grow as CSO staff numbers increase.",
                "The additional need in the operational services, supplies and sundry equipment subhead is driven by increased postal and advertising costs. Postal charges and the number of post outs have continued to increase, even with increased use of online response facilities. Advertising is necessary to raise public awareness of the value of participating in CSO surveys, with a view to increasing engagement with surveys and assuring quality. Maintaining and increasing response rates is key to the quality of data with falling response rates a serious organisational risk. The additional need in the policy reviews, consultancy services and research subhead relates to increased requirements for cybersecurity related consultancy in 2024.",
                "The CSO has reviewed all subheads to maximise savings available and to minimise the additional need requirements. The CSO has successfully identified savings of €1.03 million from within administration subheads and also proposes to reduce the additional need requirement by using an excess of €300,000 in appropriations-in-aid. As a result of these efforts, the CSO has reduced the projected additional demand on the Vote to a net figure of €400,000 and is therefore requesting a substantive Supplementary Estimate of €400,000.",
                "A Supplementary Estimate of €4.667 million is requested on behalf of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP. The key function of the Office of the DPP is to provide a prosecution service that is independent, fair and effective for the people of Ireland. While the Taoiseach has certain responsibilities to the Oireachtas for administrative matters in the Office of the DPP, the office operates independently of the Department.",
                "There are three factors which give rise to the need for this Supplementary Estimate. I will address these in the order in which they are listed in the Vote. In subhead A2, an additional allocation of €785,000 is required on the administration non-pay subheads. The additional funding is required to fund investment in ICT, staff training, accommodation and to meet increased travel costs in relation to staff servicing an increased number of court sittings, particularly outside of Dublin.",
                "Subhead A3, fees to counsel, expenditure on fees to counsel is, to a large extent, dependent on the level of activity in the courts at any time, and so is always difficult for the Office of the DPP to forecast. The projected overspend of €5.52 million on this subhead can be attributed to a general increase in the number of indictable prosecutions directed across all the courts, and to a significant increase in activity in the Central Criminal Court. The number of judges assigned has increased from five to 12. As a result, there has been a very significant increase in court sittings, trials and lists to be supported by the Office of the DPP.",
                "The factors giving rise to the overspend in 2024 are likely to continue into 2025 with the appointment of additional judges by Government. However, an additional allocation of €6.6 million has been added to this subhead for 2025 to respond to increased levels of court activity around the country. The Department of Public Expenditure, NDP Delivery and Reform sanctioned an increase in fee rates of 10% with effect from 1 January 2024. This has also had an impact on overall expenditure on fees to counsel in 2024.",
                "Notwithstanding this, the fee rates payable to criminal barristers in 2024 are still 16% below those which were paid in 2008.",
                "With regard to A4, the law costs subhead covers the payment of legal costs awarded by the courts in judicial review matters and other legal proceedings. The projected overrun of €400,000 in 2024 is principally due to an increased number of claims arising from a significant general increase in court activity in recent years. These cases were settled on behalf of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions by the State Claims Agency, which manages third-party legal cost claims against State authorities. The additional expenditure I have advised the committee of amounts to a total of €6.705 million. However, savings of €1.86 million anticipated on the A1 administration pay subhead and increased appropriations-in-aid contributions of €0.178 million has reduced the amount required by way of net substantive Supplementary Estimate to €4.667 million.",
                "On Vote 6, a Supplementary Estimate of €3.58 million is sought this year for the Chief State Solicitor’s Office. The CSSO is a constituent part of the Office of the Attorney General and acts as solicitor to Ireland, the Attorney General and to Government Departments and offices. While the Taoiseach has certain responsibilities to the Oireachtas for administrative matters in the CSSO, the office operates independently of the Department. This Supplementary Estimate is sought to cover extra expenditure on three subheads within the Vote in 2024: A4, fees to counsel; A2, administration - non-pay, relating to digital capital investment and IT services; and A3, external legal services.",
                "Subhead A4, fees to counsel, is the largest proportion of the moneys sought. The CSSO's mission is to provide the highest standard of professional legal services to Government, Departments and offices as economically and efficiently as possible and to support adherence to the rule of law. As part of the delivery of this service, the office incurs expenditure on counsel fees. The management of expenditure on counsel fees is a key activity for the office. These are primarily fees payable to external counsel following the delivery of the relevant legal service where they represent Government Departments and offices in litigation before the Irish courts, other tribunals and the Court of Justice of the European Union. They also include fees payable for the provision by external counsel of specialist legal advice for the State, whether sought for the Attorney General’s office or for Departments and offices. The overall level of these fees is, to a large extent, demand led, dependent on the level of activity in the courts at any time and complexity of the given cases. Therefore, they can be difficult to forecast.",
                "In recent years, the office has seen a marked increase in the complexity and volume of work in areas such as commercial and procurement law, property law, planning and environmental law, social welfare law, commercial litigation and mass litigation. A major growth area over 2023 and 2024 to date has been in judicial review litigation against the State. This increase is driven primarily by a number of factors, including immigration and asylum related judicial review and large-scale judicial review litigation in areas such as social welfare, education, integration-international protection reception conditions and planning and environmental law.",
                "An allocation of €17 million was made for expenditure on fees for counsel in 2024 - a reduction of €2.5 million on 2023. This reflected the fact that particular project work involving counsel had come to an end. However, the current position shows that after the fees requested by counsel undergo a value for money assessment, this will leave a shortfall of €3 million in this area over the allocated amount.",
                "On subhead A2, with regard to the expenditure on digital capital investment and IT services, the office is operating in an increasingly digital environment. Access to reliable electronic case and records management systems are central and critical to the delivery of solicitor services to the Attorney General and to Government. Increasing problems with the reliability, performance and accessibility of the case and records management systems posed significant risks to the continuity of delivery of the core legal service to Government and necessitated an essential upgrade in 2024. The work undertaken should ensure a more robust and reliable system going forward. The shortfall for this subhead is €859,000.",
                "Regarding subhead A3, an additional allocation of €50,000 is required to cover a projected overspend under this subhead. The CSSO has identified savings of €329,000 in subheads A1, administration pay, and A5, general law expenses, which can partially reduce the estimated overspend. Following the offsetting of the identified savings, the net substantive Supplementary Estimate required is €3.58 million.",
                "I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Supplementary Estimates with the committee."

                "I wish to raise one issue with the Minister of State that she identified in her opening statement. It concerns Vote 5, which is the Supplementary Estimate for the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. I note what she said about how a significant part of the Supplementary Estimate is due to fees to counsel, that is, to barristers practising in the criminal courts.",
                "I welcome the fact that this Government has significantly increased the level of resources that have been put into the criminal courts. As the Minister of State mentioned, it is apparent that we used to have just five judges on the Central Criminal Court, but now we have gone up to 12. Much more work is happening there. The benefit of that is it speeds up the criminal justice process for persons who are accused or, more importantly, for the victims and their families, who want to see cases get on promptly.",
                "One of the consequences of the increase in the amount and capacity of the Central Criminal Court is that is has spread the work more widely among barristers, which is a good thing. Previously, some of the work was concentrated on a small number of barristers. Now since there are 12 central criminal courts and, of course, there are circuit criminal courts, the work is spread much more broadly. It is not possible for one barrister to hold on to a lot of work.",
                "That brings me to the point I wish to raise about counsel’s fees. I am a barrister but I do not practise in the criminal courts. As the Minister of State will be aware, as a result of and from the time of the financial crash, between 2008 and 2011, a cut of more than 28% was applied to the fees paid to criminal barristers. Fortunately, this Government has done a lot to restore some of those cuts. In budget 2024, the restoration process started, and I think there was a restoration of 10% announced in budget 2024 that came into effect from 1 January this year. In budget 2024, I think the Minister, Deputy McEntee, announced a further 8% restoration. However, it is still the case that fees paid to criminal barristers are approximately 10.5% below what they should be. I am conscious and I welcome that the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, earlier this year confirmed that all other FEMPI-era measures had been fully reversed and unwound. I am not asking the Minister of State and I am conscious she cannot give a commitment in respect of it. Does she think there is an awareness in Government that something probably needs to be done in respect of the ongoing, continuing cuts that were applied and implemented since 2008? I note in her presentation that fees to counsel are an important part of having an effective administration of justice. My concern is that if we do not, we start losing people from that area of the profession. I am not worried about the interests of barristers but it will damage the administration of justice because we will not have sufficient interest in that area of the law to prosecute cases."

During the financial downturn, a number of cuts were applied to counsel fee rates, including two separate reductions, which he referred to, 8% in March 2009 and April 2010, which mirrored cuts provided for by the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act. An additional reduction of 10% was applied from October 2011, which had no parallel in the emergency legislation. While the Minister for public expenditure sanctioned a 10% increase in fee rates effective from 1 January 2024, restoration of the other two cuts of 8%, dating back to 2009 and 2010, still remain outstanding. Accordingly, fee rates payable to criminal barristers in 2024 are still 16% below those paid in 2008.",

Now that the collection phase of the census pilot survey is complete, the census team will review that information gathered. Once the final context is agreed and approved by the census advisory committee, the census questions will be sent to Government for approval. That will take place in 2025. A full report of the pilot will be published as well on the CSO website at this stage. Regarding the North-South, I will come back to the Deputy on that."

We know the climate crisis is spiralling out of control and we all saw the scenes in Valencia last week. In the work Trócaire does and in the countries in which we work in southern Africa we have seen countries declare states of disaster due to drought. We continue to see human suffering due to crop failure, food insecurity and the loss of livelihoods. We know the climate crisis is a crisis of inequality.",

Half of the 43,000 people who lost their lives were children under five years of age. Somalia has minimal emissions - 0.03% of global emissions - so there is a great injustice here in that richer countries and corporations continuously fail to reduce emissions or to mobilise climate finance on the scale that is needed. This COP is a climate finance COP.",

The losses and damages caused by climate finance are pushing countries into unsustainable debt and diverting public finances from development needs. Members will remember that, after decades of struggle, a new loss and damage fund was operationalised at COP28 last year. This was a milestone. The first financial pledges were announced, with $702 million pledged to the loss and damage fund. However, this covered less than 0.2% of what was needed. With Christian Aid Ireland, we conducted research that found that Ireland’s fair share of loss and damage finance was projected to be at least €1.5 billion per year by 2030. Ireland pledged €25 million last year at COP for loss and damage, representing less than 1% of our fair share. Given the global picture, the milestone that was the loss and damage fund will be meaningless if it is an empty fund. It needs to be filled. Otherwise, developing countries will be let down again. We need a clear commitment to scale up new public finance for loss and damage.",
                "A critical issue at COP will be the inclusion of loss and damage as a subgoal of the overall new climate finance goal, as no money has yet flowed to the loss and damage fund under the UNFCCC and there has historically been an imbalance between mitigation and adaptation finance. There should be a subgoal of identifying a floor of $400 billion for loss and damage out of an overall climate finance goal of at least $1 trillion. We can discuss the figures further if members have questions about them. This point can seem very technical, but it is crucial. One of the main problems in climate finance is the lack of transparency and accountability. This is an accountability measure, but it also consolidates loss and damage as the third pillar of climate finance that it should be. We call on Ireland to progress these matters at COP. We are also looking for a commitment from the next Government to scale up Ireland’s loss and damage finance.",
                "The figures can seem quite large. We are talking about going from millions to billions in Ireland and, globally, to trillions. This is very possible, though. It is a question of looking at new sources of climate finance. For example, oil and gas companies have taken an average of $2.8 billion per day in profits since 1970. There are widespread calls for windfall taxes on oil and gas companies, including by the UN Secretary General, who has called for the “immoral” soaring profits of oil and gas companies to be taxed and argues that “grotesque greed” is punishing the poorest and most vulnerable people while destroying our only common home. We call on Ireland to advocate at COP29 for windfall taxes and, thereafter, to engage in initiatives to mobilise new sources of public finance that we need for climate finance. The most marginalised and poorest are facing the worst impacts of the crisis and being left to pick up the pieces with no support. We are looking at this COP for Ireland to ensure that climate action is centred on justice and equity."

                "I thank the committee for the invitation to speak today. As an international aid and development organisation, we see the impact that climate change is having around the world. It is a profoundly unequal process. Many of the world’s poorest communities are facing increasingly extreme climate disasters despite having minimal responsibility for causing the crisis and the least resources to adapt.",
                "In the interests of time, I wish to focus on the issue of climate finance and, more specifically, the new global climate finance goal - the so-called new collective quantified goal, NCQG - that is expected to be agreed by countries at COP29.",
                "At COP15 in 2009, wealthy countries pledged to provide $100 billion per year in financial support to developing countries for climate action by 2020. The underlying rationale here was that wealthy, high-polluting countries in the global north are largely responsible for causing the climate crisis and should therefore take the lead in providing the finance needed to address it. However, the $100 billion goal was fundamentally flawed in a number of key respects. First, it was a top down, wholly political figure, not based on any scientific assessment of need and therefore only a drop in the ocean compared with the actual scale of needs in developing countries. Second, the goal was poorly defined, with little clarity on what types of funding actually counted towards the target. As a result, the overwhelming majority of finance has been provided in the form of loans, only adding to existing debt burdens in developing countries.",
                "Wealthy countries ultimately failed to meet this relatively meagre target by the 2020 deadline. Despite data from the OECD showing that the target was finally met two years late, in 2022, colleagues from Oxfam have estimated that only around $28 billion to $35 billion of that was actually in public climate finance. Therefore, the negotiation of a new global finance goal at COP29 that will ultimately replace the $100 billion target is a crucial opportunity to get this right and restore the trust in the process. The new unifying target ought to provide financial support for all three facets of climate action: emissions reductions; building resilience; and reacting when disaster strikes.",
                "I wish to briefly set out some of the core political questions regarding the NCQG that still remain live ahead of COP29. First, the new finance goal must be based on the needs of developing countries. The most recent review by the UN's Standing Committee on Finance estimates that around $5 trillion to $6 trillion is needed by developing countries out to 2030. Alongside our civil society partners, we are calling for an NCQG that reflects the scale of needs in developing countries, with a strong focus on the provision of public climate finance and sub-targets for mitigation, adaptation and loss and damage. While the scale of finance required is significant, it is important to remember that governments spent $7 trillion on subsidies for the fossil fuel industry in 2022 alone. Similarly, it also underscores the need for bold, ambitious economic measures to raise new revenue, many of which have been discussed in this committee before. This is set out in further research from ourselves, Trócaire, Oxfam and others, and includes proposals for fairer taxation of extreme wealth, taxation on fossil fuel production, as well as new international levies on aviation and shipping.",
                "Second, the NCQG must be provided largely in the form of new and additional grant-based finance. A key weakness of the $100 billion goal was the lack of transparency around reporting on climate finance contributions. As a result, many wealthy countries, including Ireland, have significantly double counted or relabelled existing finance flows to developing countries, such as official development assistance, ODA, as climate finance commitments. The NCQG must ensure that climate finance is new and additional to existing development funding and does not detract from already limited ODA budgets, leaving the world’s poorest to choose between existing development needs, like schools and hospitals, or adaptation measures, like flood defences.",
                "Third, wealthier developed countries, including Ireland, must take the lead in providing the bulk of the finance under the new goal in line with principles of historical responsibility and equity. Under the UNFCCC, countries defined as developed, such as the US, Japan and Ireland, have obligations to provide climate finance. However, many wealthy countries contend that the new finance goal can only be agreed on if additional obligations are placed on countries currently defined as developing but whose economies have grown.",
                "While these are legitimate questions, renegotiating criteria for contribution to climate funding raises complex questions of historic responsibility. There is also a huge lack of trust from developing countries that these questions are being raised as a means of avoiding responsibility, particularly given the lack of delivery on targets to date. The countries we work in, and communities waiting on financial support, simply do not have the time to wait. Under any new goal, the wealthiest, historically highest-emitting states will still need to step up and provide the bulk of climate finance support. Rather than risk delaying the negotiations at COP29, we urge Ireland and the EU to focus on meeting their own unfulfilled obligations and to lead by example.",
                "The new climate finance goal could be an historic step towards addressing the injustice at the heart of the climate crisis. However, in order for that to happen, wealthy countries, including Ireland, need to take the lead in playing a constructive role during the negotiations in Baku.",
                "Ireland played a crucial role as the lead negotiator for the EU in brokering the political breakthrough on the loss and damage fund at COP27. Last year, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, effectively negotiated on behalf of the EU during the finance talks. Ireland can play a similarly important role at COP29 and use its voice within the EU negotiating bloc to push for an outcome on the NCQG that is both ambitious and based on the key climate justice principles I have just outlined. The Minister has emphasised the need for a political breakthrough on climate finance at COP29. We very much agree with his assessment that Ireland’s position can be a bridging position between the global north and the global south.",
                "Beyond playing a constructive role in Baku, and I will conclude with this, the most important thing Ireland can do immediately is to step up and provide our fair share of the existing global target, which we along with our colleagues from Trócaire have calculated at approximately €500 million per year. As Ireland’s annual climate finance reports have shown, our contributions have steadily risen over the past few years, but we are still providing far less than our fair share of the existing global target, which is due to be revised significantly upwards in less a month’s time. As such, the green line representing a fair share on the graph should be considered the absolute floor of our ambition, and something that should be delivered now rather than pushed out to 2025. We recognise that the scale of finance required, both at a global level and for Ireland specifically, is very significant. However, it is important to remember that this is ultimately a reflection of the seriousness of the situation we find ourselves in."

When you get into the meat of it in Article 28, there is stuff about unabated coal power as opposed to even just coal, never mind the rest of the fossil fuels, and there are references to technologies. All of this points to something substantially less than what the science indicates we need, which is a rapid phase-out of all fossil fuels, We should not rely on the magic of future technology, which allows us to put off the radical changes we need now. How do the witnesses feel things are shaping up in terms of COP29? Friends of the Earth has pointed out that the Presidency's action agenda does not include any mention of phasing out coal, oil and gas, which is obviously worrying. How do they see the prospects of getting substantially stronger language into the final outcome?"

This COP will be no different. We are not following the process as closely as Friends of the Earth but it is a constant battle and we can see that short-term politics is taking precedence over the climate action we need. Very linked to that is the need to unlock the finance debate. Last year, COP nearly fell because of adaptation and developing countries again feeling that they are not being listened to regarding the finance that is needed for overall mitigation and their overall climate plans. Therefore, the point for this COP as well will be seeing the interlinkages between the two and the fact that we will not be able to move forward on our climate targets unless the finance is provided."

Developed countries, including Ireland, are essentially arguing that the global landscape has changed significantly since 1992, when the developed country list under the UNFCCC was agreed, and should be expanded to include economies that have grown and are big fossil fuel producers. In our view, it is still very much the case that countries in the global north are largely responsible for the extraction of fossil fuels in the global south, and the burning of those fossil fuels, and that they are responsible for causing the crisis and therefore still bear the major responsibilities. Many NGOs in the global south see this as a technique to distract from the fact that there are responsibilities that have to be met and have been unfulfilled for decades. Whether or not China or other countries provide climate finance, and in many cases they already do, it does not change the fact that we have obligations which we have not met.

The biggest problem with climate finance is there is zero accountability. There is a new report by the ONE campaign which refers to this area as the wild west of reporting. There is no uniformity, the definitions are loose and countries use different criteria to report climate finance. It is becoming meaningless because the whole point was that it would mobilise new money that would be directed to the countries that needed it but this is not happening. Often, climate finance takes away from development finance. The EU's position is not to agree a figure for the new goal or even have discussions on it. It is very difficult to see how developing countries can have trust in this process when it is being blocked at every pass. What is needed is a collective coming together to say we have an historical responsibility, we have broken promises for decades, and now we will chart out new era of climate finance in order that the action we need can be implemented."

There should not solely be a political negotiation on what we can make people do. There should be some joining with the science of what is needed and the actions needed. Is there at least progress on the principle of it being science-based rather than being a purely accounting fantasy exercise? Will the witnesses give us a sense of the European position on these issues and what the witnesses think is needed from this? This is the part that we can try to influence.",

Where are Ireland and Europe on this? In many sectors of society big changes are needed, such as with regard to land use. As I understand it, Article 2.1 is about why the financial sector in general needs to change so as to be less damaging to our climate but this is separate from climate finance, which is how we fund what is needed."

There is no figure yet. If we took €1 trillion as a floor, and it should definitely be a floor, this would be based on an assessment of needs that exists in relation to mitigation finance of €300 billion, adaptation finance of €300 billion and loss and damage finance of €400 billion. We believe the structure of the subgoals should be balanced in this way, with more funds going for loss and damage. Historically, no funding has gone towards the costs of loss and damage.",
                "Within that context, the quality aspect is key. Our big call is, essentially, for public, grant-based finance. This is what we see as the obligation of developed countries. The big problem with climate finance to date is that it has been primarily focused on loans, which creates more debt for countries. A statistic shows that 43% of countries suffering severe debt problems paid more in debt payments to lenders than they received in climate finance between 2019 and 2021. Countries are being saddled with debt and not getting the finance they need. We need to flip the system around in this regard. This point must be very clear. It must be crystal clear in the new goal that this funding will primarily be public, grant-based finance. There will be some concessional loans as part of mitigation.",
                "As Mr. Fitzpatrick said, the big problem with the €100 billion figure was that it was an arbitrary, political one. No one can honestly say they know what the climate impacts are we are going to experience and, therefore, what they are going to cost. We can, however, cost NDCs. We have budgets attached to them. There is also the UNFCCC standing committee on finance that does assessments of need in the various areas. There has not been a loss and damage finance gap report. We strongly advocate for this and we would really like to see a commitment to it emerging from this COP. In the absence of a formal loss and damage gap report, we would work off a figure of a floor of €400 billion, which is the latest data projecting loss and damage costs.",
                "Within that and related to it, the new sources of finance are very important. We do not want states to say the figure has risen dramatically and they are going to focus on private finance. We need to be sourcing and mobilising new sources of public finance. If we look at loss and damage and adaptation finance, these elements need grant-based finance. Profits should not be made from supporting people surviving a drought or from those displaced from their communities.",

Both aspects will, potentially, have major impacts. When we look to Ireland and at our own financial flows, the ActionAid report from last year estimated that €6.2 billion of finance flows through Irish investment managers on its way to the global south to fossil fuels and harmful agribusiness. It is clear that, domestically, we also need to look at these financial flows and how we are regulating, because Ireland has a unique position in respect of the companies resident here."

One of the major problems with the goal of €100 billion was that there was no discussion of a figure until the very last days of COP15, and then one was plucked out of the air.",

To note as well, there have been three years of preparatory negotiations on the NCQG to date. Developing countries have tried to discuss a quantum and developed nations have been resolute in their ambition to leave that to the final few days. There is a certain amount of cynicism and Ireland should avoid getting dragged into that.",
                "On the importance of grant-based finance, it is worth noting that Ireland's track record here is really strong. We should use the fact that we provide most of our climate finance in the form of grants as a negotiating tactic and push for that. There are both moral and practical reasons we should provide grant-based finance. On the moral side, it is recognition that the responsibility for causing the climate crisis is a developed-country responsibility. From a practical perspective, it simply does not provide sense to provide climate finance in the form of loans which only add to the indebtedness of the recipient national or local governments and essentially hamper further climate action.",
                "Another important point worth mentioning here is access to climate finance. For years it has been a persistent barrier for many of the local communities we work with in their efforts to fund measures to tackle climate change. At present, I think less than 3% of global climate finance goes to the least developed countries. For many, the issue is not so much the quantum or amount of money agreed in Baku, which is critically important, but ensuring that money is made readily available and can start flowing to where it is needed most quickly.",

Again, there is a reason there for the Minister, Deputy Ryan, to consistently highlight this at COP29 and push for it.

There is a case for him to do that on a number of different issues, including the need for high-quality grant-based finance for subgoals for each of three strands of climate finance and for better access for local communities."

Rather than acknowledge the fact that there have been decades of unmet obligations delivered to developing countries, wealthy countries are asking why this country or that country is not paying, stating that they need to be included in this new, expanded list. I did not mention it earlier but it is worth pointing out that there has been some research done by the climate think-tank, ODI, which has shown that even if the list of climate finance contributors were to be expanded based on cumulative emissions and the financial capacity to pay, there are only around five or six countries in the world that would be added to that list.

At the moment they are not, but perhaps that is something Ireland needs to consider to address its particular situation."

It is quite concerning, however. As Mr. Fitzpatrick said, there have been three years of negotiations leading to this. To see where the conversations are at leaves us very worried that even those things will not be achieved at this COP. We have spoken about the trust of developing countries. It has been eroded.

Even when we discussed it with the Minister, Deputy Ryan, he raised the issue of how many developing countries are very frustrated at their lack of access to private finance. That is a separate issue, however. That should not get used as a cover for the public finance. The witnesses mentioned, for example, potential levies on the major profits of certain corporations. As I understand it, because those corporations are not parties to the treaty or to the COP, that is something individual countries or, indeed, Europe could do and that would then develop revenue and that revenue could be channelled as an innovative source of finance. It is really useful to tease those two issues out.",

Ireland has been in a really good position compared with others in the European Union with regard to aid. Ireland has a principle of not having tied aid whereas, in fact, many countries in Europe do have very strong tied aid. They say they will lend the money if the recipients buy their thing, for example. They will lend them money, but they need to give them something else in another policy area. Looking especially at Ireland's position as a negotiator for the EU, I am concerned, and we are seeing right now a very massive land grab happening internationally. It was mentioned in the written piece from Friends of the Earth, which talked about the danger of carbon markets as a potential false solution that could be presented and the dangers of large areas of territory effectively being almost ceded from developing countries for corporations or other countries to use them as an excuse to continue with business as usual.",

What is the critical mass of countries that need to sign up to it in principle to get to the point that we could have a first draft of text that then becomes a more concrete discussion point? Is that feasible for Rio in two years' time, for example? I know it is a separate process that happens on the outside, but it would be great if that became a discussion point.",

At the moment, they are not there within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, process. They are not properly recognised. I know there is a call for that. Is there scope for that discussion to start at this COP? Next summer is when countries are developing their nationally determined contributions. Is there scope for a campaign, for example, to have countries include their military emissions in their nationally determined contribution calculations, which would potentially feed into that? It is one of the big elephants in the room that is not being acknowledged at the moment. Now, unfortunately, we are seeing a re-proliferation in the arms race, which could, of course, scupper our emissions altogether if we are not counting military emissions and so on.",

On one hand, it is a much bigger conversation about how we have this extractivist model that got us into this crisis and whether we are able to switch from this model as we try to get out of the crisis. Of course, I do not think anyone believes we can continue with business as usual and yet continue to debate human rights and the environment and somehow tackle the climate crisis.

It is the same as how there are lots of critiques of the Green Climate Fund but, again, it is a fund that sits under the UNFCCC. We would strongly argue that the funds that disburse climate finance should sit under the UNFCCC and then the guardrails should be within the UNFCCC. Therefore, if all the finance moves outside of that structure into private finance, which goes completely back to that description by the ONE Campaign as being like the wild west and people just doing whatever, it is not going to work.",

That in some ways is in opposition to money flowing from private interests to make profit or is at odds with what communities necessarily need. Building that quality argument in discussions of climate finance is crucial.",

At the previous COP, there was a lot more discussion around military emissions than I had heard, but it was very much on the sidelines and from civil society, so it did not seem to necessarily be rooted in the formal COP discussions. There is probably room for a lot more work on that and for building it in. The emissions are one thing. A statistic from 2021 shows how €1.3 trillion was spent on military spending and we are talking about €1 trillion needed for climate finance, so there are those parallels.",

The single biggest guardrail, as Ms Curran already touched on, is ensuring that in the COP decision text and in the decision text relating to the NCQG, we have very strong language indicating that public finance which is untied needs to be at the core, rather than this very ill-defined vague notion of mobilised climate finance, which is everything and anything. One of the real issues with climate finance is that there is no internationally agreed definition of what it actually is. This has resulted in countries counting whatever they deem to be climate finance as climate finance. It is unlikely that countries will come together and agree on a common definition at this COP but one thing we could at least have is a list of what does not count as climate finance. Essentially, this would be an exclusion list. This could include carbon credits. One of the big issues is that we need a narrative shift as to what counts and what does not count, not only through an international agreement on what it is or is not.",

Multiple investigations have been carried out, some by The Guardian. One of our partners, Power Shift Africa, produced a report last year at COP28 which showed the host country, the UAE, was buying up vast tracts of land in African countries in order to sell carbon credits to major polluters and was displacing people from their land in the process. This is deeply unjust. At the same time, it does not achieve real emission reductions. It is not the solution. This narrative needs to be brought to the fore by countries such as Ireland, which, to be frank, is currently not doing this. Major developed countries are pushing this as the solution. We need to outline what the false solutions are as well as looking at the actual solutions.",

Unfortunately, given the nature of the COP process, it is very unlikely we will ever have a COP in country with a perfect human rights record. This is not to say Ireland should not take a stance and acknowledge the fact there are human rights issues in all of the COP host countries. In terms of looking ahead to next year, one thing Ireland can do is raise this with the presidency next year. Brazil will host COP next year. We should advocate for greater inclusion of civil society in Rio. We should also advocate for greater transparency around the inclusion of fossil fuel lobbyists. If I am not mistaken, last year for the first time we had a register to determine the presence of fossil fuel lobbyists at COP and we now know how many there are.",

It is interesting that the fact this may need to be strengthened was mentioned. There is a discussion now about the fact that it allows for up to 10% of mixed investment to still be in fossil fuels but the Minister can lower it. In fairness, I have had constructive engagement with the Minister of State Deputy Calleary, and others on whether this could be lowered to 1% or 2%. At present, it allows for 10% of a mixed investment package to be in fossil fuels. The legislation allows for the Minister to reduce this. The figure is 15%. An audit was carried and 9% is the highest exposure that Ireland has in any investment group. Of course there is scope to reduce it from 15%.

This relates to importation. We have a bit of a dilemma. On the one hand, Ireland has credit internationally for the fact that we banned fracking but we have new legislation that facilitates and fast-tracks the potential importation of fracked gas from other countries. This means we are contributing to the extraction of this particularly dirty fuel internationally. Will the witnesses comment on what steps we should or could be taking to strengthen our credibility? Do we need to start looking at addressing these anomalies? The fossil fuel divestment legislation originally brought forward by Deputy Pringle and supported throughout the Oireachtas was very good for its time. Could we look at strengthening this or look at how the provisions within it could allow us to divest further?"

In total, €147.991 million in additional current expenditure funds will be allocated to the Vote, €68.5 million in capital funds will be reallocated to other subheads and €29 million in capital will be reallocated to current expenditure.",
                "Taking the substantive Supplementary Estimate for current expenditure first, €90 million will be allocated to public transport services. I am pleased to see passenger numbers performing so well and I expect continued growth in them through the remainder of 2024 as we continue to deliver on our commitment to improve and expand public transport services. The funding will assist in meeting cost-of-living challenges and provide for the continuation of the 20% average fare reduction on public transport services, which was introduced in 2022 as part of a suite of cost-of-living measures, and the continuation of the young adult card initiative on PSO and participating commercial bus services. These initiatives have proven popular. I know from my constituency and elsewhere in the country that they have been met with approval and people have been voting with their feet by using the services more and more, which we would all agree is positive.",
                "The second item in the Supplementary Estimate concerns the transition to the new Coast Guard contract. As part of the transition, agreed contractual milestone payments to the value of €19.667 million are due. These are for on-duty Coast Guard fixed-wing aircraft delivered certified and available for flight in the contracted configurations and the technical acceptance completed for on-duty Coast Guard helicopter No. 1.",
                "The third item in the Supplementary Estimate concerns €3.394 million for a number of existing Coast Guard costs, including the full-year costs for aviation services in 2024 and support for digital incident management systems, as well as volunteer training, volunteer payments and equipment maintenance.",
                "The next item on the agenda consists of €1.656 million for Irish Lights, covering additional weather-related costs for repairs to coastal infrastructure and additional costs pertaining to environmental compliance.",
                "For the Road Safety Authority, €7.614 million is being sought due to increased running costs and declining income from services owing to indexation provisions in contracts with third-party suppliers of key services. This funding is required to ensure the continuity of RSA operations in the final months of the year, pending the introduction of a range of fee increases and revisions in January 2025 to cover the coming year.",
                "Some €2.7 million is required for driver vehicle and licensing services within the digital hub to cover increased licensing and postage costs, which have incrementally impacted the cost of delivery in recent years. It is intended to introduce legislation to digitise much of the driver vehicle and licensing services, which I hope will see a reduction in postage and other paper-based costs.",
                "Some €3 million is required to address general pressures within the Department’s administration budget, particularly operational costs arising from the increase in the Department’s staff complement over the past two to three years, as well the cost of delivering the Department’s IT services, which are also a part of the digital hub.",

The first is a capital allocation from the REPowerEU fund of €18.46 million for the installation of charging equipment at Drogheda railway station for the battery-electric rail fleet, which will start to arrive from 2025. The second capital allocation is €1.5 million from the shared island fund for the Carlingford to Newry greenway.",
                "Next is the technical supplementary. To reallocate funds within subheads, €296 million is allocated to subhead 8.3 - cycling and walking active travel measures for 2024. In addition to this funding it is proposed to allocate €7.5 million from an underspend on greenways and €27 million from an underspend in public transport investment. These additional funds will go towards existing costs for projects as the investment programme has once again performed very strongly in 2024.",
                "On subhead C.7, €16 million is being allocated for electric vehicle grants and infrastructure. Under subhead C.4, which is regional and local roads protection and renewal, a further €18 million is allocated from an underspend in the coastguard across to regional and local roads protection and renewal.",
                "The adverse weather had detrimentally impacted the structural integrity of the roads network, causing significant damage, with pothole development and ultimately pavement failure requiring significant additional investment across the network. Given the amount of damage to the network due to these events, additional funding of €30 million to local authorities through the restoration and improvement grants would allow the restoration of affected roads while bringing resilience in the network for future weather events. Further, €4 million is to prepare for the implementation of lower default speed limits on local roads.",
                "Finally, it is proposed to reallocate €29 million from the A5 Border to Derry road across to the current public transport services to ensure sufficient funds exist to support public transport services to finish out to year end.",

                "It certainly is the case that there are increased numbers on public transport. I think it is a shared policy objective to encourage more people to use public transport. The Minister of State is from a commuter belt county, as am I, so he will be familiar with the challenges faced by high-frequency services into and out of this city. I can speak particularly of routes such as the 103 and the 105, which serve Ratoath and Ashbourne, and the 109 and NX, which serve Navan and Kells. We have heard about a number of factors. Our local councillors in County Meath spoke to representatives of the NTA and Bus Éireann yesterday. We have had representatives of those bodies before this committee many times through the years and we constantly get a picture of constraints or difficulties in terms of the recruitment and retention of drivers and mechanics and how that impacts on the fleet and, of course, congestion caused by the very considerable works and delays. There is huge frustration as a result of works in Ashbourne, for example, which have long over run. There is also congestion in the city, such as in Phibsborough and at The Halfway House on the N3. Will the proposals the Minister of State has announced address some of those issues? What engagement has he had with Bus Éireann, Dublin Bus and others to address those concerns?",
                "A general election is imminent and these are hugely important issues for people. I can give an example of a resident in Ashbourne who literally lives 150 m from the nearest bus stop. On paper, it should be an excellent service based on the timetable, but the resident has a secondhand or \"new to them\" car with N plates is parked in their drive. Why? It is because the family cannot rely on the service. The parents gave an example. They said they were away on holidays for two weeks. Their young fella works in the city and, of the ten days he had to go to work, he was late on eight days because he could not rely on the bus service. Even though the bus stop is 150 m from their house, it is no use to them because every time a bus reaches the bus stop, it is full and passes intending passengers.",
                "Therefore, when he is getting the bus, he travels 2 km up the road to access the bus there. I am sure this is not news to the Minister of State and he is familiar with this picture. It is a problem for everybody concerned and it needs to be addressed. In these measures, does the Minister of State see improvement for the likes of that young man and commuters right across commuter belt?"

Councillor Caroline O’Reilly has been very vocal on those issues as well - bus services to Ratoath and Ashbourne, the ones the Deputy mentioned - and I met with her on that recently.",
                "The Deputy is right that there are a number of causes for that, such as the increased popularity of the service, which is a good thing that we want to encourage. However, we need make sure they are reliable, available, frequent and affordable. I think the affordable part has been tackled through the PSO interventions, the 20% cuts, the young adult card and so on. The reliability is one we need to get 100% right. If people are getting a bus and the bus is turning up late or not turning up at all, which was the case on some occasions, that is not good enough.",
                "However, in my experience, speaking as a commuter myself, I think there have been significant improvements in the past six to 12 months. Coming out of Covid, there were continual issues. The 120, 124 and 126 buses in my area, in the Deputy’s area and across the commuter belt had begun to lag. The reason for that, as the Deputy mentioned, is there was a shortage of drivers. It was difficult to get people back into the same working day. That was a challenge across many industries post Covid - hospitality, catering and so on. Some people changed roles and lifestyles in the meantime. Mechanics is a particular issue. We really need to support further apprenticeships for the development of careers in the area of mechanics. Not just ordinary mechanics, which are very important for private motor cars, but heavy duty, heavy vehicle mechanics. I have met with Dublin Bus on that. I had a good discussion with Billy Hann on that and I was committed to bringing that through as well. He is creating multiple in terms of mechanics and actively seeking more. I met with Go-Ahead on that, the provider of many services in the Deputy's constituency and in my own, and others around the commuter belt. I have spoken with Stephen Kent of Bus Éireann as well on similar issues. I have been engaging with the transport companies on that. We are seeing improvement in terms of drivers. We need more mechanics still. The call goes out today and every day. If people are interested, I encourage school leavers and people to look at that as an alternative career path and explore it with the companies. They are open and willing to recruit people and take them on. We need to have constant reliability that has, unfortunately, been an issue in the recent past.",
                "The Supplementary Estimate of €29 million goes towards the end of year. The Supplementary Estimate is for now to year end, which is only two months. However, it is important. It is important to maintain a minimum existing level of service but also provide additional supports where needed in areas of the type the Deputy mentioned.",
                "Regarding the mechanic and driver shortages, we got agreement recently to place those trades on the critical skills list, which will help with the recruitment and retention of mechanics. That is now recognised as a critical skill.",
                "Part of the funding is about capacity in the network, such as issues like a bus being full when it pulls up at the stop, which I see in my constituency and I am sure the Deputy sees in his. More double-deckers and more frequency of services would help that. The 139 in my area of Kildare recently got an additional bus added on the fleet on a daily basis. All of those things are key to make sure that when people make the choice, which I recommended every day, to use the bus or train rather than getting in their private car where at all possible, we need to provide the supply and service to meet that expectation. I think we are doing that. We are making huge strides, particularly in this last term of Government. I will not say this €29 million is a panacea. It is not. It is a Supplementary Estimate to year end. It will go towards supporting those provisions and measures into the future. I hope that the next Government, whatever its make-up, will be as ambitious and committed to public transport as the last Government has been."

                "This is one of the big issues and frustrations I hear about from people. The tool that is available to us is parliamentary questions. Bus Éireann will say that it has a performance efficiency rate of 96%. That really offends people because it does not reflect their experience. Some of those who use bus services irregularly will see lots of vehicles on routes. This issue relates to people who organise their lives, their working day and their working week around public transport services. Those services are not nearly as reliable as they need to be. The Minister of State provided an example. Because double-decker buses were not running on the relevant routes for a number of months, those routes were awarded to private providers that use coaches. As a result, there was a reduction in capacity in real terms. In what ways are the Minister of State and the NTA holding bus providers to account? Have fines been issued? Are there commitments in respect of approvals?",
                "There are a number of good private providers, such as Ashbourne Connect, for example, that have been affected by the fare reductions on PSO services. These providers are running viable services, filling a gap and meeting demand. They tell me that because people are voting with their feet as a result of the fare reductions, there have reduced numbers on their services. In the meantime, people are shifting over to services that cannot meet the level of demand. I have asked this question at a number of fora. Is consideration going to be given to fairness across the public and private services in terms of fare reductions, specifically the 20% fare reduction?"

                "On yesterday's decision, and I have said this many times but it is useful to say it on the public record, the passenger cap at Dublin Airport is not a function of or a matter for decision by the Government. It is not a decision of any Minister, Cabinet or Government. It is a planning condition imposed by An Bord Pleanála in 2007. An Bord Pleanála, as with all planning authorities, is independent of government and the political system. It is important that all stakeholders and observers are aware of that because those issues are sometimes confused. I welcome the clarity yesterday's decision brings. I publicly welcomed it in a statement yesterday. Planning processes lag behind the growth we have seen at Dublin Airport and the economic growth of the country. The decision perhaps affords a little time to the planning authority to complete its work. I encourage the DAA, as the airport management team and agency with responsibility to manage the airport, including compliance with planning conditions, to continue to engage with An Bord Pleanála and Fingal planning authorities. It has done that but I would like to see that engagement continued and expedited. I expect that will happen. I have spoken to all parties involved and encouraged them to see that this is not an issue where delays should feature.",

I was surprised at the apparent lethargy of certain players on the pitch in moving it forward. It has gathered momentum of late. It would have been preferable if this had happened four, five, six or eight years ago, but it is happening now. The decision to place a stay on that gives some breathing space but it should be used wisely and productively in the interim. All those actors need to seriously engage now and move forward so that this situation does not reach a crisis point again in the near future.",

The Minister of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne, gave me a list of groups in the Deputy's area. I also met with residents in the north Dublin area and wider area around the airport. I am sure the Chairman has met residents in that area as well. I met with some of the Chair's people, if I could put it that way, as well. It was very important that I did that and that those voices are heard in the debate. They are also very important stakeholders. I will not comment in too much detail about the discussions or outcomes because some of that is subject to planning, legal constraints and current processes. I will say that I took careful note of those discussions. I have had subsequent conversations with the DAA, among others. I am confident that there is - I will not say flight path - a path forward, which it is to be hoped will be to the satisfaction of all. We are a little bit away from that yet, but I certainly noted the views of residents and expressed those in summary form to the relevant stakeholders with a view that they should be taken up and taken seriously.

However, I would like to hear the Minister of State's own view. I have very strong views regarding making measures such as these permanent; in fact, going further. We have examples within the European Union, in Germany, of fares being reduced to zero and the impact that has had. While I do not think we are anywhere near being able to do that in this country because it would likely grind our public transport service operators, and, indeed, some private operators, to a halt, as an ambition, it should be stated it would be mine.

                "This is a bit wider than the Estimates and is more a policy decision but I am quite happy to engage on it. It is important. In the first instance, before I get into the fares piece, I have always had a very strong view that public transport should be the primary default choice of commuters or travellers for whatever reason. It should not be the car first and people saying \"Oh maybe there is a bus I can get as a fallback\". It should be the other way around - we should only use the private car if we cannot find an attractive public transport option. It is what I typically have done in my own private life for many years. I will always look at the train or bus timetable first and see if that is the way to go before taking the car on a journey. This is for many reasons. It is more pleasant. You can double job by working on the train and getting your laptop out. I have always said that public transport should be at multiple things. It services distributed communities, which is important at a time when we know we have a shortage of housing supply. People are living further away from home and work and the city is expanding right across constituencies including my own constituency of Kildare North and those in Meath, north Dublin etc. High-quality, frequent public transport actually enables distributed communities because people can live further out and get into work without too many hiccups. Indeed, it also supports distributed communities in terms of extending family and people visiting. For social capital, it is important that people are not becoming isolated while living out in the suburbs, and this will not happen if they are only a Luas or DART connection away from visiting friends and family elsewhere. It also provides equality of opportunity in terms of access to education and to work, and access to advance. All of those things are so critical. That is before we even get to the obvious environmental benefits such as the emissions reductions and reaching all the really important climate change targets we have. There are a number of reasons we should continue to promote public transport. To get there we need a number of things. We need it to be available in the first place. If there is no bus, you cannot get it. We have made great strides in rolling out the network further and further in recent years.",
                "It must be frequent; that speaks for itself. It must be reliable; there is no point waiting for the bus if it does not turn up. That is a fairly fundamental issue. It must be affordable, and we will come back to that in a minute in terms of the fare reductions. There are big ticket items that I really hope will be taken and advanced by the next Government. I am sure, Chairman, that we all hope to be part of the team and returned here the next time around, but we will see - that is up to the people. However, there are a number of big ticket projects for whoever is here the next time around.",

We need to get to the stage where we begin to see the benefits because, let us be honest, there have been some interruptions to communities and some disturbance to residents on different streets, etc. We understand that. Building is always tough, particularly when it takes up some land acquisitions. However, we must get to the stage where we are seeing the benefits and people are getting those services and using those buses to rapidly get to and from work and they begin to talk about how it is actually a great service. That is where we need to get to with the next phase of this."

The reason, of course, is that the infrastructure requires change and sacrifice. There are communities up and down this city, and I am sure in other cities where BusConnects is being rolled out, that will have to endure inconvenience for that infrastructure to be built in.",
                "In the county town of Swords in my constituency, during the initial phase of discussions about where the bus lanes would go within certain communities, there were objections to the removal or moving of boundary walls of estates that were 5 m, 10 m or 50 m from the nearest homes. If we maintain that attitude, it will be 2040 before the bus lanes are put in. All members are out knocking on people's doors these days. There are probably tens of thousands of volunteers and would-be Members of these Houses knocking on doors. There needs to be that realisation that if we are not prepared to allow for that structural change to happen, particularly within this city, then it will not happen and those services cannot be provided in a reliable way, such that the ghost buses on the app, to which the Minister of State referred, do not persist and we do not end up with three buses showing up at the same time because they are all in the same bottleneck. There has to be an element of reality injected into the conversation about how these infrastructural projects come about and, indeed, how they are delayed. I get quite annoyed about it, to be frank with the Minister of State, particularly when certain arteries within the south city are talked about with some sort of fondness for the past. The reality is that, as a Government, through climate action commitments and, indeed, commitments by the Department of Transport and its agencies, trees that might be removed will be replaced and, although the aesthetic is being lost, the benefit far outweighs that, in my humble opinion."

We need to take a little bit of inconvenience - I will not say \"pain\" - to get to the final goal, which is a far more streamlined, efficient and effective public transport system. BusConnects is not just a few buses and a few routes. It is actually public transport corridors and quality bus corridors, which involve construction. I have been talking to the engineers involved. This is not just a couple of traffic cones. This is a fully fledged construction project that is under way. There are other projects to look at. The metro to the airport is under way. I have met with and spoken to Dr. Sean Sweeney, our esteemed project director, who has had a very accomplished career and is a very impressive individual, on a number of occasions. That project is kicking off.",

Planning permission has been secured from An Bord Pleanála for DART+ West to extend out to Maynooth. We are hoping to drive that on further, to Kilcock and possibly even to Enfield at some stage. As regards DART+ South West, planning permission is expected imminently from An Bord Pleanála to go to Hazelhatch and Celbridge. The next stage is on to Sallins and potentially into Newbridge and other towns in due course.",
                "They are really important transformative projects. I have talked about Dublin because it is the capital city and it is where the greater bulk of the commuting population live, but, with regard to the regions, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford are also getting BusConnects and local rail and light rail systems. As well as this, there are a number of Luas projects, including for Finglas, Poolbeg and Lucan. Luas Finglas was approved by Cabinet last week. We really are steaming ahead on all these projects.",
                "To double back to the comment on fares, these projects cost significant moneys. There is a view that they are mega infrastructural projects. My strong view is that spending on transport infrastructure pays big dividends economically and in community gains. It is well worth spending on and we need to continue doing it. With regard to where we go on fare reductions, the evidence and international experience suggests the most important metrics, as mentioned earlier, are availability, frequency and reliability - having a bus or train available that is frequent and reliable. The element of how much it costs is probably slightly less important than these other three. The top three are about making it work, getting people where they need to go and being reliable.",
                "I welcome the continuation of the fare reductions we have had. We will have a challenge in future years regarding how we will fund the service. Should it be self-funding, whereby the revenue collected would go back into it? There has always been a degree of State subvention. It is how public transport works. Public transport rarely, if ever, generates a surplus or a profit. This is not how it is intended to work. There will be subvention and the question is what degree of subvention is required. There is also the question of whether it takes from other projects as there might be other expansionary goals. It is an interesting question and perhaps it is something that would deserve a full discussion on its own.",

It is all good, to be honest. If people are using a tram for two stops or 20 stops it does not really matter because they are still using it and this is welcome. It should be available. It should be very much affordable to all, including students, younger persons and older persons. This is key. There comes a certain point where there are diminishing returns once it is affordable. I am not convinced it should always be free. There are other policy considerations in this regard but this is a discussion for another day. If we are back here again next time, in whatever role, it is a discussion we can take up."

He also mentioned the new fixed-wing aircraft, which I believe has been acquired and is being certified. How did the €18 million underspend arise? The new contract for search and rescue was mentioned. I have not been briefed on it but I understand it has been taken up by a new company. Perhaps the Minister of State will touch on this. Will we see increased numbers of aircraft? I presume the S-92 helicopters are being replaced by AgustaWestland or some such company. I ask the Minister of State to give us an idea of this."

With regard to the figures I mentioned on the Coast Guard spend being carried over, the building programme has not moved as rapidly as we might have hoped. There has been some transition of certain projects to the OPW. They have been devolved to the OPW. There were some administrative handovers that probably delayed things. This has meant there has been an underspend. Certain facilities that were anticipated as being built or advanced in the current year have been carried over to next year. This is how the underspend has arisen with regard to facilities.",

I had a technical briefing on the machines and equipment and I am confident they are going to take us into the next generation of search and rescue and all things the Coast Guard needs to do. They come with a fleet of operatives, people who are highly trained in all of the different services the Coast Guard provides. They will be complementary to our existing dedicated Coast Guard team, both professional and volunteer, around the country. They are arriving. I think a number of them have already arrived and there are a few more coming into being and they will be located in various bases around the country – some are operating out of the west and others are operating out of the west and the south-west coast. Each region has a base and equipment available to it. That is a very important progression.",
                "There has been some commentary in the media about the new helicopters and perhaps some negative commentary, which is a bit unfair. There were technical criteria for the new helicopters in terms of their ability to manoeuvre and to access mountain tops, whether they can open one or two doors on each side. I am being very simplistic about it as I am not a helicopter operator but the new helicopters can navigate coastal terrain, mountainous terrain, challenging terrain, cliffsides, choppy waters, etc. - perhaps things a larger helicopter may have difficulty doing. I refer to their accessibility to and flexibility in certain situations. There are a number of different metrics they were assessed on and I am quite confident they deliver on all of those. I should also add that the Coast Guard has invested in drones, which does not require a significant limelight on expenditure, but I mention it in terms of technology being adopted to complement need.",

If we look at the aircraft used in the North Sea, they are virtually all S-92s - and I have been on one myself - or aircraft of that type whereas the AW 139 is not of that type. Again that is my own meagre knowledge of the capacity of that type of aircraft. If the Minister of State has time today, tomorrow or on Thursday morning, could he provide the committee, through the secretariat, with a short note on the capability question of the aircraft versus what we had? I presume the €18 million is capital and therefore may go to alteration and expansion of existing services within the four bases. I am thinking in particular about the viability of Waterford Airport. On behalf my good friend and colleague, Senator John Cummins, and, indeed, our ministerial colleague, I am asking about the future of the Waterford base and whether there might capacity for or a requirement for another base. I understand there are four aircraft with one in reserve. That is the old criteria. Is that still the case?"

Are we to assume that the Road Safety Authority is an organisation which is not expected to turn a profit? If it is an organisation that is not expected to turn a profit on the basis that it provides a vital service, how are those of us who are members of Government parties, for now at least, to sustain the vital services it provides without having these conversations? There are people speaking ill of the authority while its chair is contributing to newspaper articles saying it cannot perform its function unless it is funded appropriately.

Certain technical specifications and so on would have to be met on both sides for that engagement to proceed but it is something that is envisaged as a possibility. This means the Defence Forces are not quite out of the picture completely - there is provision for them to get more involved over time. I am not sure if it is in the contract but certainly in the overall objective of the engagement, there is a goal that the new helicopter fleet could serve a number of uses. It would be primarily search and rescue but, for example, we held meetings with the HSE recently on potential collaboration on helicopter emergency medicine, HEM. If someone is in a near-fatal or catastrophic accident and needs immediate attention, it is possible that the helicopter fleet can be dispatched for those kinds of incidents. It is early days of this being worked through but the intention of the business case to support it was that the helicopters might have multiple uses for the greater good. It is important to recognise that.",
                "The RSA has been challenged and is being challenged now. That is why another Supplementary Estimate is being voted through today to provide funding for it to get to the end of the year. Since its inception, the RSA’s revenues have been entirely dependent on income generated from the services it provides: the NCT, driver permits, driver testing, commercial vehicle testing and similar services. There is a sort of polluter pays principle which is standard in many industries, such as banking, where there is a regulator which is funded by the industry. I am not at all calling drivers the polluters but the industry paying for itself is a very common standard used across many industries. However, it does not always work and it is not always appropriate.",
                "In the current instance, what we are seeing is that, first, there have been operational deficiencies in terms of the provision of services by the RSA. For example, NCTs are not being provided on time, driver testing is not being provided on time and while commercial vehicle testing is about where it needs to be now, it was not for a while. Some of the other services provided are just about right but there have been three years, year on year, where we saw a failure to meet service levels. That is not acceptable to me as Minister of State, to the Department or, more importantly, to the people who are relying on those services to get to work, college or where they need to go, and need to have a car that is roadworthy and certified or to have a driving licence. Let us not forget that they are paying for these services. It is not a gift. It is something they contract for and are obliged by law to have. There was a need to examine that and to seek to drive greater operational efficiencies.",
                "A separate arm of the RSA that is very important is the road safety advocacy piece which, in whatever new incarnation it ends up, needs to include a strengthened research arm that will look at emerging trends. I have just come from a meeting with driver test instructors and we were having a discussion, which is also ongoing in the Department, about how a modern vehicle is almost unrecognisable compared to the vehicle of 20 years ago. Whether it is electric, diesel or petrol, whether it has CarPlay, AppPlay or some other infotainment system built into the dashboard, whether it has a GPS on the dashboard or on a sticky on the screen, car technology has continued to evolve in many ways. Even the noise an electric vehicle makes is very low when compared to traditional engines. There are many new elements to a journey in a motor car. This is something the RSA and other stakeholders, including the driver instructors I was speaking to earlier, need to stay abreast of as they continue to evolve their curriculum, their advocacy, their guidance or their campaigns to show the latest trends and explain what people need to be aware of.",
                "The RSA has done very important work and continues to do it. We are in a much better position regarding road safety than we were when the RSA started out 20 years ago. I believe 149 deaths is the latest count, or perhaps 151 after the weekend. Every death is a tragedy and every death that could be avoided should, of course, be avoided. However, we were in the high 300s when it started out, so it has done a huge amount of good work. The intention going forward is that the restructure will see an operational arm, which will perform the services, such as the NCT, driver testing and the mechanical services, in one agency, and then a separate entity. Whether that is an agency, an executive agency or an arm of the Department is yet to be decided, but a separate entity would do important work and would be independent of the operational piece. I believe that will drive better performance on both sides of the fence."

The Minister of State in his opening statement went into great detail about train services regarding Drogheda and the charging facilities that have been put in there for DART+ Coastal North. I believe there is a charging facility for the Maynooth line as well. I am sure there will, ultimately, be facilities in south Dublin if it is deemed necessary to put them in or if the overhead lines cannot be put in at the same time. I said in my opening remarks as Chair of this committee that we are very much in the midst of a revolution when it comes to the provision of public transport. The rail network is a fantastic example of where, if you put the money in, the reward is very obvious and tantalisingly close for a lot of communities, particularly in the Minister of State's constituency and county that he mentioned and in my own.",
                "I am, however, ever so slightly concerned, given the track record of the delivery of this sort of project, that we may see planning delays. The four-tracking of the northern commuter line from Clontarf Road to Malahide to provide capacity and space for more frequent services, about which this committee had a conversation with Mr. Meade and his colleagues from Irish Rail, and the DART+ Coastal North and battery-electric services that are to be provided in January 2026, which is just 13 and a half months from now, may be problematic because of the experience we suffered as a result of that timetable change that I know the Minister of State is only too aware of and which, indeed, my constituents are thoroughly browned off with. It is a little on the frustrating side when I think about the likes of that capital infrastructural project plan - 4 North, as Irish Rail is calling it. I understand a report will be published in the new year. My concern is that capital project, and I do not think it would be unfair of me to say it, is likely to take a decade to deliver because it involves CPOs, assessments, surveys and all those things, while keeping the northern commuter line flowing, which adds a layer of complexity.",
                "When it comes to overhead lines being installed in Kildare, south Dublin, Wicklow, north Dublin, Meath and Louth, what assurances can the Minister of State give the committee and the listening public that everything that can be done is being done with regard to planning processes and the expenditure of public funds through the Department and its agencies on the delivery of these absolutely essential services? I would love to have to have a plan on my desk here setting out how we plan to electrify rail services throughout the whole country and how we plan to reconnect counties that have not had a rail service in a couple of generations - the north west, for example, and even Meath. There are parts of Meath and north Kildare that had services but no longer do, and yet now they are very viable commuter communities, as the Minister of State well knows, and do not have train services. Perhaps my question relates to ambition and perhaps the Minister of State might touch on that in his response."

The Cathaoirleach is a keen supporter of the DART+ Coastal North and the four tracks on the northside. Some issues relating to the new timetable were attributed to a lack of four tracks in certain places. Eventually, certain pull-in points, lay-bys, etc., were used inventively by Irish Rail to address some issues and that proved the point that the four tracks are very desirable. I would say the same regarding the line to my area. We could do with four tracks to Newbridge and beyond. We can do a number of things.",

I would be familiar in my professional work prior to my current role of other cases that would have progressed with some alacrity when it was needed.

We are seeing that already. I will give the assurances to the Chairman and the watching public that a planning court was established earlier this year.

The difficulty is, of course, that when third level institutions resumed in September, buses were passing by both travelling students and the general public by the time they reached north Dublin, specifically Balbriggan and other towns in the northern end of what is now to be Dublin Fingal West. Obviously, it is very problematic, particularly when I get a response from the service provider telling me that it is monitoring it or whatever. However, it does not really have capacity to add another bus. Maybe it will have capacity to add a larger bus, but we need to re-evaluate sometimes, and I am sure this is probably applicable in the Minister of State's county, as to how we respond to demand-led problems. There is nothing worse, as I am sure the Minister of State will agree, than dutifully going out to use public transport to cut down on one's emissions and, indeed, reduce costs of congestion and then have the bus drive straight by."

                "Absolutely. The Chairman's first question was about the €29 million from the A5 Border to Derry project. That is part of a wider project to connect the north west. That goes from Clontibret in Monaghan across the Border right through Derry into Donegal and beyond. That is a very significant commitment by Government. It is aligned with the shared island project in terms of cross-Border funding. The price tag is much greater than €29 million. It is multiple of that, in fact. However, the €29 million that was allocated is not required in the current year. It will not be drawn down at this stage. It is being carried over and that will from part of separate Estimates for next year. Rather than having that sort of wither on the vine, it is being reallocated within public transport services.",
                "As the Chairman mentioned, it is so important that we ensure the reliability and capacity of those buses. Indeed, one thing I will continue to progress, including today and with the NTA, is the need for capacity on all routes. The Chairman mentioned a bus passing by that is full. I have seen that in my constituency as well. More double-deckers were mentioned earlier, and more buses in general, not only in terms of the routes that are established but the people who are travelling on them. That is really important. Ultimately, the bus service must be flexible and responsive when there are demands. In my area, when Maynooth college used to start ever year, the service supplied it with a particular number of buses.",
                "Within two weeks I would get calls from students or families as a local representative and I am sure other members do as well. I would ring the bus operator and they would pretty much say, \"That is grand. We will tweak it next week\". Then they try it out. Every year there are different demands and different patterns. Within a few weeks of starting, they would say they would add a bus or occasionally they would take a bus off or put it on at a different time, depending on demand. A lot of this is trial and error but it is important to be responsive, so where there is great demand we can increase capacity and where there is less demand we can reallocate it somewhere else. That is just good management.",
                "There will always be constraints with the funding and that is why we are here today with the Supplementary Estimate to make sure we can get more funding where it is needed. For the fleet, we need to invest in capital expenditure to purchase the new carriages. The DART+ fleet is one particular project. Rail carriages and bus carriages are no different in that they need to be commissioned, built and then put into service. We have also talked about the driver and mechanic shortage. Those trades are now going on the critical skills list, which should assist in recruitment and retention going forward."

                "I thank the Minister of State. I will conclude by taking the opportunity to revisit the conversation we had a little earlier in relation to Dublin Airport, as this is our last committee meeting scheduled before we presume the plug is pulled on the Thirty-third Dáil. It is necessary for me to commend the Minister of State's frankness in his remarks as to how we got here. As I have said in the past, often it is lost when we listen to the usual vested bellowing interests on our airwaves telling us that it is easy and that we can fix it like that, but we cannot because it is a legal and planning process that must be followed. We can revisit this issue. The committee has heard first hand from the Dublin Airport Authority. I attended a meeting in a private capacity, as it transpired, with the board of the DAA and heard there were constraints as to why it could not apply to change the planning conditions until recently. I am afraid that I cannot accept this assertion. I have eyes, I have a brain and I have access to add the sequence of events that have gotten us to the point we are at. Having met with all parties, with the exception of the airlines, which are subject to the case that culminated in an interim decision yesterday - as I will call it - by a member of the Judiciary, there is reputational damage to consider, although it was quite the correct decision by the regulator to curtail the operations of Dublin Airport for next year in order to adhere to the law of the land. It is another discussion, which I will come back to, that we have to comply with such a decision from 2007, but I am extremely frustrated. From reading what the Minister of State, Deputy Lawless, and what the Minister, Deputy Ryan, had to say it appears that we share the frustration that the reputational damage potentially caused by the sequence of events that led us to this decision being made, rightly, by the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, and then ultimately it having to go to court because the airport operator failed to adequately address these issues in a timely manner. This was all coupled with - I hate to say - a very slow and long-winded process to get us to this point in what is an extremely complex area of flight paths and finding the least worst option, as I have phrased it in the past, so that it impacts the least number of people. This is interrelated to the overall conversation about airport expansion because, quite bluntly, one cannot expand Dublin Airport's operation with the current flight paths and particularly those that use the new north runway. I would encourage the Minister of State to sit in Kilcoskan National School or on the outskirts of Ashbourne and witness what it has been like for families and children experiencing that. I ask the Minister of State to bear in mind that these communities live next to an airport and they do expect aircraft noise.",
                "They expect aircraft noise but they never expected aircraft flying directly over their heads because it was never envisaged as such. It is appropriate to reflect on that in our closing remarks.",
                "The overall issue I will touch upon is the fact that this is a legal process. In response to Deputy O'Rourke's question, the Minister of State said that we now have a decision on this issue. That decision calls into question the legitimacy of a planning condition. I am not questioning the planning condition. It was made in good faith at the time but I do not think it applies any more. Maybe that is what the justice based his decision on. However, I am concerned that the courts can just set something aside, notwithstanding that it was likely the right decision, as I said. Again, I am not questioning the judicial decision. That is not our place in this House. I am concerned, from a general perspective, for instance, entertaining an international treaty, that it somehow trumps domestic planning law. That is a bit peculiar. How can the Department respond to this issue that has arisen and ensure that we are not here in six months, or in 12 months in particular, and a resolution to this issue can be found that can be reached as quickly as possible, notwithstanding the fact planning is in process? A decision is before Fingal County Council. How can we aid that local authority to expedite the decision, which will ultimately have an overall impact on the operations at Dublin Airport?"

                "I will make a couple of comments. I have visited the communities around the airport. I have sat in houses in St. Margaret's and areas that are very much affected. I am not sure I was in the exact school mentioned but I certainly was in, or passed, a school very close to it, when I was in St. Margaret's. I have heard for myself the aircraft overhead. It is a complex issue. I welcome and agree with the comments that oversimplification of it by some actors has been unhelpful to the process. There are a lot of moving parts in terms of the systems and the different decisions. We have a noise quota system monitored by ANCA, which is a subagency of Fingal County Council. A decision on night flights was made recently, which is now under consideration by An Bord Pleanála. These are before we even get near the cap. These are separate decisions that have serious implications for all of those.",
                "A strategic infrastructure concept is outlined in legislation. When they were drafted in the early noughties, the planning and development Acts included a number of different types of projects designated as strategic infrastructure, which meant they could bypass the normal local authority planning process. Dublin Airport was one of those until 2019, when the then Minister, Shane Ross, moved it back to Fingal County Council. That was done for a variety of reasons. It was primarily to allow for a noise agency to consider noise applications and have a court of appeal, going back to An Bord Pleanála as a second-level appeals body. One could debate whether that was the right call at the time. People make decisions at the time for various reasons and with various advices. It strikes me, and has often struck me, that perhaps it would have been better remaining within strategic infrastructure or some new version of that.",

There are live planning applications and a live judicial process, even though an interim decision has been made. As I said at the outset and in my statement last night, it is important all players in the system are aware and the public is aware that yesterday's decision is by no means an end in itself. It is very much an interim stay. There is much work to be done. Regardless of the ultimate determination in the courts, which is listed for December, and regardless of any interaction of EU treaties, open skies, EU-US treaties, other international laws and the Irish planning system, the simplest way to address this is for the planning application to be lodged correctly, coherently and comprehensively and for the planning authority to have the opportunity to study it, process it and arrive at a decision. If necessary, an appeal process will take place - that is part of the system at the moment - but ultimately it is that the planning authority would arrive at a decision under planning rules. That is the system we have. It works in most instances. It works best when it is supplied with the information it needs when it needs it. An early application gets an early decision and a late application gets a late decision. I think these are all fair statements to make.",

I have been exploring that with the Attorney General recently, but the options are limited. I can say that much for sure. The preferred way for everybody through this is that the planning process does its work. It needs everyone to co-operate and move quickly. I will leave it at that because there are other processes ongoing with this.",

While I have been clear that I would like to see the passenger cap lifted, and while the ultimate outcome I desire, although the planning process must do its work, is that the cap be lifted because I think the airport can go to 40 million, and I have been clear in saying that and it is consistent with the national aviation policy of the Department and previous Ministers, that said, we have additional capacity in Shannon and Cork airports. Five million extra seats are available right now in those two airports. We also have smaller airports around the country. No good reason not to use that capacity has been advanced in more than 20 meetings with stakeholders. They were helpful, informative and constructive meetings, by and large. A total of 86% of our air traffic goes through Dublin Airport. Dublin has a significant percentage of the population but it is not 86%. If we did this proportionately, we would not have 86% of people flying out of Dublin and we would have a much greater percentage flying out of Shannon and Cork. I encourage people to explore the alternatives that exist. Regardless of what happens with the cap and with Dublin, there are perfectly good airports up and running around the country."

                "I thank the Acting Chair and the committee for facilitating the discussion today on the Supplementary Estimate for 2024. It is required to make use of savings on the Department’s Vote. It is also required to provide additional funding to meet liabilities in a number of areas. These include 2024 costs apportioned to my Department for the development of the border control post in Rosslare, TB-related cost pressures and farm payments due under schemes such as the agri-climate rural environment scheme, ACRES.",
                "An additional €200 million, representing an increase of 10.2% on my Department’s gross 2024 allocation, is required to meet costs that will arise in 2024. The Supplementary Estimate will also provide for the movement of savings of €46 million across a number of subheads to meet expenditure pressures arising in other areas. As these proposed transfers and additional expenditure involve changes to the original 2024 voted allocations, I believe it is important to seek the committee’s input and approval.",
                "The areas where savings have emerged reflect the very dynamic and challenging environment in which the sector and the Department operate. Despite the continuing challenges facing the agrifood sector, including unpredictable weather patterns, high input costs and the delivery of a range of new CSP schemes, farmers have demonstrated their adaptability and resilience and have continued to deliver safe and nutritious food for Irish and international markets.",
                "To support farmers to meet these challenges, since the beginning of September this year, advance payments totalling €874 million have been made by my Department to a record number of farmers in respect of their 2024 basic income support for sustainability, BISS, complementary redistributive income support for sustainability, CRISS, payment scheme, eco-schemes and areas of natural constraint scheme payments. The balancing payments in respect of these schemes are due to commence in early December.",
                "My Department has provided committee members with more detailed briefing material on the specifics of the Supplementary Estimate, but I will now highlight some of its key elements, broken down by the four programme areas under which expenditure occurs in my Department.",
                "Programme A, on food safety, animal and plant health and animal welfare, is being increased by 17%, or just over €63 million. The main reason for this increase is that the level of bovine TB in Ireland has increased in 2024. The 12-month rolling TB herd level herd incidence on 22 September 2024 stood at 5.6%, compared with 4.74% on the 24 September 2023. The 12-month rolling number of TB reactors on 23 September 2024 stood at 37,685, compared with 26,039 on 24 September 2023. This reinforces the need to support the TB programme not just financially, but also ensure that the policies the TB forum develops are implemented in a robust manner.",
                "The on-farm market valuation scheme is the principal compensation measure to herdowners whose herds are affected by the disease. It is available under the TB eradication scheme. This compensation is based on the market value of that animal, subject to individual animal ceilings under the on-farm market valuation scheme. While market values have broadly remained static since 2023, weakened factory salvage recovered against animals, primarily dairy animals, removed under the scheme has resulted in the average compensation per head rising by 23.5% year-on-year.",
                "The large increase on the administration side of programme A is, in the main, due to the OPW payment for the Rosslare development. As I have highlighted to the committee previously, the upgrade to Rosslare Europort is a critical project to develop the necessary permanent infrastructure required as a result of Brexit. Some €21.5 million will go to the Office of Public Works as my Department’s apportionment of the 2024 development costs.",
                "Programme B relates to farm sector supports and controls. Its total allocation is being increased by €117.72 million. This includes an additional €106 million for ACRES and €9 million for residual payments on the 2023 Ukraine-related tillage schemes and the 2024 national sheep scheme.",
                "In addition, with the savings identified throughout the Vote, I have allocated extra funding to programme B as follows: €11.6 million for organics; €0.5m for multi-species sward-red clover; €1.32 million for the sheep improvement scheme; and €28.6 million for ACRES. In respect of ACRES alone, this will bring the total 2024 expenditure to some €334 million. As the committee members are aware, ACRES is my Department’s flagship agri-environmental scheme, with an allocation of €1.5 billion over the period to 2027. In response to the exceptional demand from farmers, I was delighted to be able to secure places for all 55,000 farmers who applied under tranches 1 and 2, and this additional funding of €134.6 million will provide for substantial payments to farmers in respect of 2024. I reassure members that I will ensure the maximum levels of funding will be paid out under all farmer schemes to farm families between now and the end of the year.",
                "Funding within programme C, policy and strategy, is used to optimise the sustainable development of the agrifood sector and, following this Supplementary Estimate, programme C will increase by €22 million, to €447.8 million. My Department leads on Ireland’s engagement with the World Food Programme, WFP, and a significant percentage of this increase relates to the WFP. The WFP is funded exclusively from voluntary contributions and works in partnership with other UN and international organisations, NGOs, civil society and the private sector to enable communities and countries to meet their own food needs.",
                "I reinforced Ireland’s commitment to the WFP on my visit to the Horn of Africa earlier this year. In doing so, I pledged a total of €105 million for the period 2025 to 2027 to directly fund the WFP’s global humanitarian work. This represents a 40% increase on the funding made under the previous three-year period. The advance of €18 million in 2024 on next year’s commitment will help save lives by supporting food security and nutrition in very fragile humanitarian settings. It reaffirms Ireland’s role as one of the WFP’s most engaged partners.",
                "Under this programme, an additional €5 million is also being provided to support the sustainable beef and lamb quality assurance scheme, which is managed by Bord Bia. This sum represents an advance payment to Bord Bia in respect of 2025.",
                "The allocation within programme D, for the seafood sector, has been reduced from €170.6 million to €167.34 million. Savings on both the current and capital within programme D were identified and used elsewhere within the Vote. Some of the savings in programme D are payroll savings that have been declared by the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority and Bord Iascaigh Mhara.",
                "This is a necessary and important Supplementary Estimate which I recommend to the committee for support. I am happy to respond to any questions members may have."

                "I appreciate that this is all work we have to do to get it out of the way and clear the decks. However, I am particularly interested in the section of the Minister’s opening statement where he referred to ACRES. The amount of difficulties and problems people are having with that across the country, particularly in the co-operative sector, is something that really needs to be addressed. We have farmers coming to us all the time who are really frustrated, having applied for what they thought was a scheme that would be rolled out over five years. Some of them are two years into it and still do not know their score. They do not know where they stand. The opportunity to carry out other activities on the farm which would enhance their score has basically been denied them because they have not had the opportunity to get the reassessment done. It is an extremely disappointing situation, particularly with ACRES, because farmers want to play their part. They want to do the right thing for the environment and everything else and they deserve to get a payment for the public good they carry out. I think we all concur and agree with that. The least we can expect is that the Department and the Government would keep their side of the bargain and come up with a scheme that is workable and suitable and that farmers can adhere to without too much difficulty and work it out from there. That certainly is not the case with ACRES.",
                "I have raised previously with the Minister the issue of TAMS grants, particularly those for the replacement of slats on slatted sheds.",
                "I still believe there is a difficulty in respect of people getting payments for them. I have been told it is an issue of approval having to come from the office of the Minister to get the payments made. There is a list of people who have been waiting for that for quite some time and still have not received any payments. While it is all well and good coming here and putting a certain amount of money into all of the various schemes, if farmers cannot get access to those schemes or find it difficult and onerous to do so, there needs to be reassessment.",
                "The Minister cannot control the weather nor can he really control the prices. The one thing he should be able to control is the schemes created and administered by the Department, and they continually are failures. We hear about problems with IT and this, that and the other. We should be long past the stage where these schemes are so difficult and continue to cause frustration. For very many years we have heard about simplification within many of these schemes. It seems they keep becoming more complex and difficult. This is an opportunity for the Minister to clear the air in respect of that and set out where and why we are in this situation where we continually have such problems with these schemes."

                "Ensuring farmers get the service they are entitled to from the Department and in terms of the schemes we run is something I take very seriously. The CAP programme last year and all of the schemes operated in a good manner, with payments made on the dates we set out, with the exception of ACRES. ACRES has been a challenge but the other schemes have worked. For the first year the CAP worked remarkably well in terms of payments. We did set dates which were between two and four weeks later than what would have been the norm under CAP. The reason for that was because we wanted to make sure we set a date we could deliver on and, in fairness, within the Department that was delivered on.",
                "The challenge has been with ACRES, which is the most complex scheme within CAP. I have worked to try to make sure the issues that arose with ACRES are being addressed in the best way possible to try to support farmers, but there have been real challenges. A big part of that has been the payment delays and the associated administrative challenges. For example, farmers did not get their scores when they should have, and those administration delays were a frustration for all farmers in the scheme.",
                "Taking a step back from it, it is important to break it down and look at it. For a significant majority of farmers in ACRES, it is working out reasonably well in terms of their payments. The average payment is where we predicted it would be, at €5,100 to €5,200. Obviously, for farmers who have got the payment they expected, ACRES is working as they would have hoped. When you break it down between the general and the co-operation streams, two thirds of farmers are in the general stream and it is working pretty well. Obviously, farmers have been affected by the delays in delivering scores but they are being given top-ups now. In terms of the actual farmer experience of the practicality of the scheme at farm level, feedback is good for those in the general stream, by and large, and the experience has been good. The co-operation stream has been much more challenging. For more than half of farmers, it is working out similar to what they would have expected in terms of their scores, but for a good minority it is not. Their scores are not what they would have expected and payments are, therefore, much lower than expected.",
                "I want to see ACRES work for and benefit everyone and to see everyone being able to participate in it in a strong way. That is why I intervened, which I think is the first time ever to have happened, in order that everyone who applied got accepted in tranche 1 and tranche 2. That had not happened previously with environmental schemes. Also, when there were payment challenges with ACRES because of the administrative challenges, in March I directed that any farmer at that point who had not got an advance payment of 85% would either get a €4,000 or €5,000 interim payment. That meant everyone who took part in ACRES, bar those who might have had a conveyancing issue or something like that with their land parcels, would have got either their advance payment or a €4,000 or €5,0000 interim payment by the end of March, and then balancing payments and scores issued over the summer. I absolutely accept the scores were late and that must be addressed by the next year of the scheme. That has created challenges in respect of giving farmers line of sight of their scores, what they would be, and time this year, for example, to improve on them. Over recent weeks and three or four months, farmers would have got their scores and balancing payments, and between 2,000 and 2,500 farmers, or 5%, await their balancing payment.",
                "Now that we have reached the point where farmers, by and large, have their scores and there is clarity on what their payments are, and on the fact that, for a significant minority, the CP scheme is not working out the way they, or certainly I, would have liked to see it work out for them, I have initiated a review with the specific targeted objective of trying to identify how we can make the scheme work for all farmers, particularly those who have ended up with lower payments than what they might have been expecting, and maybe in some cases lower payments than what they might have been getting under GLAS. I want to see what we can do now and I have put in place a timeline of the end of the year for that review to be completed. I specifically asked and directed that, as part of that review, I want to see potential options that can be taken to enhance the score and payments for those for whom the co-operation stream is not working out in the way we would all like it to work out.",
                "It is important to say that for the two thirds in the general stream, the experience at farm level has been pretty good by and large. The co-operation stream has been much more challenging. The payments for a good majority of those in the CP are working out along the lines they would have hoped, but it is not for a significant minority, and I want to see how we can address that.",
                "On NPIs and landscape actions, it is important that farmers do get those approvals. Again, that has been affected. The scheme is complex and more complex than it should be. There are no two ways about that. There would have been engagement, discussion and consultation on how it would be framed. We do not have a clean sheet on this either because we must work within the results-based structure of the current CAP, which is more complicated than the previous one. We have to make sure we make the scheme work as well as possible. Overall, the outcome and objectives behind the scheme are very good. It is just the complexity, especially the complexity of administration and IT challenges associated with it. I will consider how we can address these matters.",
                "On TAMS, the approvals and payments have been issuing in good numbers over recent months. I will look at the specific issue the Deputy has raised. If there are a certain number who have indicated their views to him, he might pass on the details to me and I will look at it. Certainly, the scheme took a bit of time to get motoring but it is motoring pretty well now in terms of approvals and payments and we need to ensure that momentum is sustained."

We have much more predictability over felling, although there is not the same cost associated with it.",

As the Deputy knows, the new forestry scheme we have brought in is very attractive and a big improvement on the previous scheme. Premiums have increased by up to 60%. Equally, the number of years farmers can get the premiums for has gone from 15 years to 20 years. Despite these changes, we are still not seeing a significant uptake in respect of the number of plantings. Confidence was definitely impacted by the licensing backlog we had to deal with. It was there when we came into office and we had to work our way through it. That is, thankfully, largely rectified now with much more regular timeframes in place in terms of the length of time taken to get a licence. I have no doubt but that the situation impacted morale across the sector too.",

This aspect is impacting on farmers deciding whether to take a term of 15 years or longer in respect of a change of land use. We have made adjustments, though. In the most recent budget, we adjusted the forestry figures to take a more balanced approach to what we thought the likely uptake might be next year.",

I chose to go to South Sudan, Ethiopia and Kenya to witness what was going on there and to engage with the WFP. As part of that, I announced our commitment to increasing our contribution by 40%, to €35 million. In recent years, we have often paid the WFP funding in advance where we could. The WFP is always willing to receive the payment early. It can also form part of the budgetary discussions and the engagements I have, whereby if I can find a way to pay it by the end of the year for the following year, it frees up more financial capacity to do the types of things I would like to do in the budget to support farmers. We are forward paying €18 million this year out of the €35 million. Last year, we paid the full €25 million early and paying the €18 million early this year will still leave €17 million for next year."

Unfortunately, ACRES has proven to be much more complex than many of the other schemes. It required a new IT system to be built and there were all of the complexities that go with that. I am certainly no expert on the ins and outs behind the screen in terms of all of the networks and technology involved. The ACRES speaks to many different parts of other activities that farmers carry out. For example, BISS payments are interrelated as well. Any change to a parcel can have an impact in respect of ACRES and there is also the scoring system. From an administrative point of view, it was very challenging and has continued to be such into this year. Thankfully, I think we are getting to a situation whereby it can operate as we would expect going into next year."

If the satellite shows something from the sky for the BISS and the feed inspection is done rapidly, in fairness to them, up to a month ago we did not have a system where they were able to feed the information into the ACRES side if it was an ACRES inspection. That is a year and a half down the road now. That is not tolerable, to be frank. In fairness, on the low land they got through the barriers but on the ACRES CP zones something needs to be done immediately. The Minister talked about farmers getting the money. Yes, they got the money, but then they got it after they had to pay money back. There was information that planners needed, such as score cards and stuff. They sent them in and then they were not able to give them the information out. It has been a pure nightmare for the planners and the farmers. In all fairness, I do not care who you are or whether it is 5% or 1%, if someone went in good faith and paid a planner in 2023, it is wrong that all those 2023 payments are stalled until January because they are trying to get out payments for 2024. It is not fair on any farmer to be treated in this way. Regardless of what the Department needed to do, we should pay them. In 2015 France was in trouble. It is there for anyone to read about. The French Government was able to get money from its Exchequer to pay the farmers. When they got all their IT problems sorted, they were able to put it back in. That 5% of farmers have their tongues out for money at the minute - they are ringing every one of us - but no one seems to be doing anything for them and they are getting awfully frustrated. The other part is that they could two bubbles in the one year and then they will have to deal with that.",

I do not know how many decades the eradication programme has been in place, but the disease has still not been eradicated. Is it time to consider a vaccination programme of some kind? Badgers were vaccinated. I remember scratching my head a number of years ago and wondering why we were vaccinating badgers rather than cattle, which would have made more sense. I know there are technical issues involved in the context of markers and all the rest of it. Is the Department working to come up with an alternative or to reassess the programme, which, by and large, has been a failure for many farmers? People have all kinds of conspiracy theories about gravy trains and everything else. We certainly will not get into that. However, the truth is that farmers find it difficult to see large portions of money from the Department’s finances being allocated in respect of an eradication programme that is not delivering."

Children learn to collaborate, solve problems and face challenges with confidence, which nurtures their sense of discovery and enthusiasm for learning.",

Five new curriculum specifications will be published in the 2025-2026 school year. These updated specifications are designed to better meet the needs of today’s pupils, promoting deeper engagement and understanding. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, will provide further details on these specifications in its opening statement.",

Strategies such as the national literacy, numeracy and digital literacy strategy, well-being policy, and the STEM education policy statement work alongside the curriculum to enhance learning and teaching, promote pupil well-being, and develop key skills such as critical thinking, creativity and problem solving. This alignment ensures our education system continues to evolve, providing a future-focused experience for all primary pupils.",
                "The Department acknowledges the need for ongoing support to help schools implement the redeveloped primary curriculum. To assist teachers and school leaders in adapting to these changes, the Department will provide sustained professional learning through Oide and the National Council for Special Education. Additionally, online resources will offer practical guidance and materials for teachers and school leaders. Funding will be provided to purchase physical resources needed to support the redeveloped curriculum. Modern foreign languages will be introduced into the curriculum for the first time. The Department is working together with its support services to put in place robust supports to ensure teachers have the skills and confidence to teach this new subject area. The Department recognises the ongoing challenges related to teacher supply. To address these issues, the Department is actively working on strategies to attract and retain qualified teachers, ensuring there are enough skilled professionals to effectively deliver the curriculum and meet the diverse needs of all pupils.",
                "I emphasise the critical importance of the redevelopment of the primary curriculum. This not only reflects our commitment to providing a high-quality education for all pupils but also responds to the evolving needs of our society. By focusing on engagement, creativity and practical skills, we are preparing our young learners for the future. We understand that the successful implementation of this curriculum relies on the dedication of our teachers and school leaders, alongside the support and collaboration of parents and communities. Together, we can create an enriching educational environment that nurtures a sense of wonder and a lifelong passion for learning. My colleagues and I are very happy to answer any questions committee members may have."

In carrying out this remit, the council is currently overseeing the review and redevelopment of the full primary school curriculum. This work builds on the many strengths of the current curriculum introduced 25 years ago in 1999, while also addressing the needs of children in our primary and special schools today and into the future. This work has been advanced through working closely with children, teachers, parents and school leaders, through extensive public consultation, research evidence, good practices, international experience and ongoing deliberation by the council and its representative structures. Key features of the work include the commissioning of the children’s school lives longitudinal study, which tracks the experience of 4,000 children across primary and special schools. Another key feature is the sustained collaboration with schools through the schools forum and ongoing consultation with children.",

Some of the features of the framework include that it is for all primary and special schools. It introduces a set of key competencies, which are priorities for children’s learning across all curriculum areas and subjects.",
                "The framework sets out the curriculum areas and the subjects of the curriculum. It introduces and expands on aspects of learning, including: STEM education; modern foreign languages from third to sixth class; technology; learning about religions, beliefs and worldviews; and a broader approach to arts education. It also gives an increased emphasis to existing areas such as physical education, social, personal and health education and digital learning, and provides for greater agency and flexibility for teachers and children. Importantly, the framework also links with learning experiences provided through Aistear, the early childhood curriculum framework, and connects with learning in the framework for the junior cycle.",
                "The primary language curriculum, Curclam Teanga na Bunscoile, with the primary mathematics curriculum, are the first two specifications of the redeveloped curriculum to be introduced to primary and special schools. Furthering the redevelopment of the curriculum, the remaining suite of draft primary curriculum specifications were published in March of this year and were subject to extensive consultation until June. The findings of this consultation will be discussed by the council at its November meeting this week, with the report published in the coming weeks.",
                "As for the next steps for the NCCA, in the coming months we will complete the redevelopment of all five primary curriculum specifications. The council is expected to issue its advice to the Minister for Education in spring 2025, and throughout this work the council will continue to be cognisant of the various strategies, action plans, reports and policies that are relevant to primary education and the curriculum in particular.",
                "My colleagues and I will be very happy to answer any questions members may have."

In looking at the time across the curriculum, we consulted on a range of options for the use of time and two key findings emerged. First, teachers, school leaders and children described very hurried learning experiences in their primary schools. There was a feeling of being rushed to the end, with pupils closing their maths books, for example, and moving immediately to their Irish books. Children, in particular, spoke about needing bigger blocks of time to immerse themselves in learning, while teachers also spoke about the pressurised aspect. Teachers pointed to the erosion of what was discretionary or flexible time in the curriculum, which was being given over to different policies and strategies that had come into the primary school space over the years. That was a key priority in restoring that flexible time.",

One was physical education, and we know we have been an outlier among the OECD and the European Union in respect of time allocations for physical education. The other was social, personal and health education, SPHE-----"

While that is fine - my mother is German, I speak German, and I grew up in a trilingual household; kids can do that, no problem - I do not really understand how that then makes it easier for kids and it is not as rushed.

It will be language awareness at third and fourth class. We are working with Oide, our support services, and with Post-Primary Languages Ireland, and we are developing a big programme of support to support the teachers in terms of language competency to upskill them to a B1 level. We would encourage the teachers to avail of Erasmus but we will be providing upskilling opportunities for them over a number of years. It will be introduced on a phased basis."

                "I remember, when I was in school, being put down the back of the class for Irish and being put aside in third and fourth class for different languages like Spanish or French. It sounds, from the response, like that is still the reality in our schools. From speaking to many Traveller children, I know they still, unfortunately, do not get the opportunity to learn Irish in school. My wee girl is five and she started school in September. She absolutely loves Irish. The Cathaoirleach Gníomhach knows very well from being here that I have no Irish. She is trying to educate me. Children at five or six years of age are sponges. Even last week, she was saying to me, \"Mammy, you don't know Irish.\" I tell her to go to her daddy or try my best with her. That was me being like many members of the Traveller community and people from other ethnic minority groups, as well as people with disabilities like dyslexia and dyspraxia, being denied being able to have their own language.",
                "I know Deputy Farrell asked the question but I wonder why the Department decided to do that. How will it be beneficial to children? I know the witnesses spoke about other languages in the school. That is a divide and conquer issue, where we reduce our Irish language to accommodate another language. We are seeing that issue on our streets today. I welcome the framework that was published in March. What has been delivered under the framework since March?",
                "Regarding the NCCA, I know my good friend, Dr. Hannagh McGinley, has done some incredible work relating to Traveller children and people from minority groups. I thank Dr. Hannagh McGinley for all her work. We have worked hard on the Traveller history and education Bill in this committee. It is unfortunate that our Government will collapse by the end of the week and that we will not have the opportunity to pass that Bill on Committee Stage. Would the NCCA still support that Bill after the establishment of a new Dáil? Would it lobby and campaign for the Bill to come back to committee? I am not saying the issue of Irish is the fault of any individual around the table. I compliment the witnesses on their work because it is difficult to work in a Department when one has little or no power. You could wallpaper this room with the policy and legislation that the witnesses have produced but there is a lack of implementation from the Government.",

I have said numerous times at this committee that we continue to fail children with special needs in this country. As far as I know, last year, 126 children with additional needs had no school places. What can the mothers and fathers of Ireland and the Department do to make sure that every child has an opportunity to go to school? We are meant to treat every child equally but we do not treat members of the Traveller community, children from other ethnic minority groups and children with disabilities equally. Deputy Farrell spoke about reduced times, which brought to mind the reduced timetables for Traveller children and children with disabilities who are impacted by them.",

It is the kinds of experiences that children have in order to have as much exposure as possible to the language and develop a love of the language which, in turn, feeds their motivation and their learning of the language.",

To fill the Senator in on what has been happening in more recent times, she will be aware of the research report that was published and that Dr. McGinley very much led the work on. Since then, we have also been working closely with schools and early childhood settings to gather real-life examples in the Irish context of how Traveller history and culture are nurtured and supported within the context of the current curriculum, because there are many opportunities in the current curriculum. The intention behind those examples which we will be publishing is as a practical support for all other teachers and schools to avail of.",

They were developed in the context of the 1999 primary curriculum and in the context of post-primary curricula at the time. We are in the process of carrying out that review and updating work and it is our intention that that would be completed towards the end of next year. In fact, we had a tender very recently to commission some additional research to support us in that work.",

We are very clear that the curriculum is for all schools and, therefore, it is all children, including those with special educational needs. One of the practical strategies that we have adopted in respect of our work, on both the framework and the draft specifications, is to work closely with a large network of schools - the schools forum. As part of that forum, there are special schools working with us. In addition to that, there are a number of support structures in place which the Department leads out on and chairs. Within those structures, we work closely with the National Council for Special Education as well. We are very conscious of building in mechanisms to ensure that the next version of the primary curriculum can really support the learning of every child in the country across primary and special schools.",

The special education piece, an area I worked in before I moved into the curriculum space in the Department, is hugely challenging for us in terms of the major explosion, particularly in the area of autism, which is seen internationally and we are certainly seeing it in Ireland too. It really challenges us each year in terms of being able to provide enough places in the right areas in order that people are not obliged to travel long distances, which is also a key aspect.",
                "We deliver a large number of special classes every year. The number of special classes has increased manyfold since 2011. Nearly all of those are autism classes but we still do not meet all the demand that is there. I have met parents, including in recent times, who naturally feel very aggrieved and upset about that. As they have to fight in other areas of their lives, they feel that they also have to fight in order to secure these places for their children. Our planning and building unit works closely with our special education section and with the National Council for Special Education to reduce the number of times that happens and to try and find solutions to it, but the difficulty comes with trying to always get those solutions in place for the beginning of the school year. Sometimes they come through as the school year advances. We acknowledge there is a problem there and we have to continue to redouble our efforts to try and address that.",

There can be times when a reduced school day can work when there is a clear plan in place, where it is time-limited and where the aim is to get a student who may be experiencing school refusal, school anxiety and things like that back to school over a period.",

Sometimes they can drift on, and that is a problem where effectively a child over time can become disconnected with that school."

Over my 40 years in education, where I have seen Irish taught best and used best in schools is not particularly where Irish is just a subject on the curriculum but where it is a way of life, it is a living language and there is genuine use of Irish throughout the day. Schools embrace all kinds of competitions, Seachtain na Gaeilge, Coicís na Gaeilge, etc. The new primary curriculum framework allows schools to use time in a flexible way and there is an allocation of flexible time there which schools can use to promote our national language. Inspectors, under the Education Act, have a really important role in monitoring Irish in schools. We certainly have a special place in our hearts with regard to our teanga dúchais and will be watching this space carefully going forward as well.

For the avoidance of doubt, I am not being rude if, in the course of asking them questions, I seek to focus the officials by interrupting.",
                "There are a lot of parents whom I am hearing from who are concerned about what the NCCA is doing, especially around the lack of consultation around sensitive matters. I will have to draw the officials' attention to some correspondence I received from a number of parents who referred to - this will help frame the questioning - their involvement in an in-person focus group convened by the National Parents Council to discuss the draft curriculum in May 2024. Arising from their concerns, they sought a meeting with Dr. Sullivan to discuss specific issues. They are not happy that parents are being fully consulted, heard and heeded in an upfront way. They list a number of things which I find persuasive, one of which is the fact that many parents do not know the primary curriculum was being revised. A very small sample of parents attending online and in-person focus groups is not representative, they say. They point out, for example, that the Minister wrote to parents announcing the free primary book scheme and ask why the Minister did not do something similar in communications terms regarding the curriculum development process.",
                "They also point to the fact there is no toolkit available for the well-being part of the curriculum. This is essential to inform parents and to allow them make decisions about whether they are happy with the way SPHE is being taught. They are concerned about the failure to define sexual identity, for example. No definition is provided. Does this refer to sexual orientation? I notice it is mentioned on page 32 of the primary curriculum framework. I am wondering what that is doing in there. I ask the NCCA representatives directly today what the NCCA means by sexual identity. Is the NCCA conscious and aware of the recent Cass review of the treatment of children experiencing gender distress and will that inform what happens from here on with regard to the SPHE well-being element of the curriculum?",
                "I say all of this because a number of divisive ideologies - critical theory, including critical race theory, gender theory and queer theory - are impacting education today. It is not clear to me how a State school can seek to protect children from such ideologies based on the principles outlined in the draft curriculum. If diversity, equity and inclusion are the principles, that is potentially a charter for the teaching of any wacky ideology if there are not grounding principles that refer, for example, to the need to have an evidence base in all that is taught, an affirmation of reason of the scientific approach. None of this seems to be referred to or strongly referred to in what the council has produced to date. For example, if gender ideology proposes that gender is fluid, that undermines the educational necessity to secure young people in their sexual identity as either male or female. To do that to children would undermine a foundational stone of their overall identity and possibly contribute to the kind of sexual confusion and the problems that we all know about that are happening now. It is questionable whether there is respect for the idea of sexual innocence as being an appropriate education principle. I would like the witnesses' view on that.",
                "To be clear, I am not talking about religious-run schools here. I am talking about education being in line with reason and scientific thought. The concern people have is that the diversity, equity and inclusion ideology is a recipe for stuff being taught to their children that is not evidence-based. When they do not even have a toolkit, they are worried. Does the council recognise the primacy of parents here, first of all? Does it recognise that what it does is subject to the wishes of parents? Does it accept fully and unequivocally that under the Education Act, it is skating on thin ice if it ignores the right of patrons to ensure that everything that is taught through the curriculum is taught having regard to the characteristic spirit of schools? In light of that, does it accept that different schools with different characteristics may take very different approaches to approaching the curriculum?",
                "Will the witnesses define for me what they mean by sexual identity? Can they also tell me why they are using the word “equity” as opposed to the word “equality”? What difference do they see? Why is there not more about an affirmation of Irish identity and European Union identity? Why is there not more about patriotism, you know? Is that a dirty word underlying these ideas? I have run out of questions so I might have to wait until the second round."

We had the National Parents Council focus group, to which the Senator referred, in the Ashling Hotel at that time. There were a number of parents raising concerns. I met them after the meeting and also at a follow-up meeting. I outlined clearly to them the approaches in the curriculum, and the awareness-raising we have done to try to reach all teachers and all parents in that respect. We did information newsletters and emails to schools, and made direct attempts through local and national radio and print media outlets.",

One thing has been the commentary that Senator Mullen provided around a recognition that the curriculum look at Ireland and the local, national and then international, including the European and Ireland’s place in Europe. There is the sense of Irish identity. What makes it a curriculum for Irish children is something that came up in the consultation and we are looking at that in the feedback we have received to date.",

I see, however, a kind of a sense of exceptionalism when it comes to the teaching and learning of Irish in our school classrooms. Are we benchmarking the outcomes of our T2 specification against international standards? I ask this because there is certainly an impression out there in the wild that our children are coming out of schools with a level of Irish that is often below that of their French or German, languages which they might only have taken on in first year in school.

I am concerned with where we are placing science, which is within the engineering, technology and mathematics strand. My concern is that often steers us towards the physics end of the spectrum as opposed to the biology end of it. The level of mathematics required to do anything meaningful at the physics end of the spectrum means students will not get there until fifth and sixth year. I strongly feel that if science demonstrations are being done, then science is not being taught. Science is about inquiry.",

He might be interested to know that when the 1999 curriculum was being developed, social and environmental education, as we are developing and conceiving it now, was actually the way it had been intended then - history and geography would go together. Science was then woven in with history and geography to become SESE. The challenge there was always that, to some extent, history and geography are natural bedfellows in the social and environmental context but the scientific aspect was always an outlier. Part of this redevelopment of the curriculum concerns the opportunity to look again at and realign social and environmental education together as history and geography, and also to align with our national STEM policy and strategy and the idea of scientific education aligning with engineering and mathematics.",

The engineering element now, though, is coming more to the fore in the STEM curriculum area. The nature of science, however, and of inquiry and investigation, the strand of living things, biotechnology and bioeconomy and all of that is very much embedded within what will be the redeveloped STEM curriculum area. We are holding what is true in the science area and carrying it through into the redeveloped STEM curriculum area to build on what was originally in the 1999 curriculum."

I feel strongly that ChatGPT having read the entire works of Plato does not help me to structure a moral outlook on the world. I would have said to Dr. Sullivan that the very first curriculum document I used to open when I was planning my year ahead was the history curriculum one. With that, I could at least say that, for example, this year I would be doing migrant peoples, Stone Age peoples or the Egyptians. It was the one part of the curriculum I could get my hook into and say six weeks of work would be happening on that aspect. It would then inform my art, drama and come into Gaeilge. When I look at the draft of the specifications now, it seems a little boneless. There is a real conversation to be had about what we do concerning content in a world where it is a Google search away. I worry, however, that we are throwing the baby out with the bathwater because we need to know some things to build a framework. When I look at the new history curriculum, I do not quite have that sense of those content objectives. In a tangential way, perhaps, this comes back to the point made by Senator Mullen, even though I disagree with him on several things."

Billie and Lacey can put nail varnish on Liam's nails and we think nothing of it and it is okay, but there is a big conversation out there and scaring of parents. I have people close to me and aligned to my politics who say children are being educated about porn and other elements of sex education. There is no harm in educating our children about sex education and what is right and wrong. I welcome that, but there is a lot of scaring of parents and people are feeding into that.

I welcome the work the committee has done, although some members show up only the very odd time, and that is their call. Members like me who give a damn about equality in our education system welcome a child who wants to be referred to as \"them\" or \"they\" having that right and that teachers respect the children's right.

The people who put their names to this very reasonable letter - Sandra Adams, Julie Anne Collins, Mennatallah Hassan and Niamh Rushe - deserve great credit for putting together a reasoned letter in which they point to particular things that need to be addressed. Sometimes when you are watching a hurling match, the referee gives a free, places the ball 75 m or 80 m out and walks away, and then the player taking the free moves the ball forward 5 m or 6 m towards the goal and the referee comes back and says he cannot do that. That is the way many parents feel about the NCCA and what it is doing.",
                "I return to the previous example, which I have checked since. The phrase in the Equal Status Act is \"sexual orientation\", not \"sexual identity\". What does Dr. Sullivan mean? Will he commit today to changing that? If he is talking about sexual orientation, is that necessarily a consideration when considering primary school stuff? If he is claiming to ground it in the Equal Status Act, then he should change it because when people see \"sexual identity\", they think the NCCA is on a mission. There is no reference to psychological, mental or phsyical health or the well-being of the person in the list of categories on page 32. That is why parents are worried. Can we have a commitment to change that? \"Sexual identity\" sounds like an ideologically loaded term that is meant to import stuff.",
                "I repeat my question about whether parents can be consulted on the toolkit. It is precisely in the area of well-being that the toolkit matters because people are already worried about what is in some of the textbooks. That is not the NCCA's direct responsibility but the books only follow the lead it is giving. How many parents did the NCCA meet, online or face to face? Is there a precise number, apart from the thousands?",
                "Is the patrons programme in the same position to influence the other five pillars as those five pillars influence each other? Given the law gives patrons the responsibility for characteristic spirit and the NCCA has to do what it does having regard to that spirit, if stuff is proposed in well-being or any other section contradicting the characteristic spirit, does the patrons programme offer the means to correct that? Are patrons entitled to ensure there is not such contradiction in any other part of the proposed syllabus in the framework?"

                "First, I will provide a summary of departmental structures for early years policy. There is a long-established history of collaboration by the Department of Education with other Departments and agencies on matters relating to early years education. In 2002, we established the Centre for Early Childhood Development and Education to implement objectives contained in the 1998 White Paper for early childhood education. A significant outcome was the publication in 2006 of Síolta, the national quality framework for early childhood education, which involved engagement with all stakeholders, including the Office of the Minister for Children, the forerunner of the current Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. When the centre was closed, its work continued through the early years education policy unit, EYEPU, established in 2006 as a small unit staffed by Department of Education officials and colocated in the Department of children. This unit supported both Departments in ensuring coherent policy-making in the best interests of children in the earliest years of their learning. A critical example of this is the development and publication in 2009 of Aistear: The Early Childhood Curriculum Framework. This seminal document began the process of bringing curriculum continuity to a previously diverse and fragmented early years sector.",
                "In recent years, the scope and pace of discrete policy and programmes for the early learning and care sector, led by the Department of children, has accelerated, and significant expansion of public funding has driven change in how both Departments work together. The Department of children has expanded its structures for overseeing the sector.",
                "To respond to these changes, earlier this year, the EYEPU was wound down and we moved to a new model of more integrated interdepartmental working. For the Department of Education, this involved elements of the work being integrated into individual line sections, for example, special education and social inclusion, with responsibility for overall co-ordination and education policy oversight located in my division.

                "The Department of Education continues to have a clear, strong role in respect of key areas, including Aistear and associated quality initiatives such as those drawing from Síolta. Since 2016, at the commission of the Minister for children, the Department’s education inspectorate undertakes evaluations in the ELC sector, initially only in settings delivering the free preschool programme but, since 2022, as a result of First 5, the whole-of-Government strategy for babies, young children and their families, this has extended to all State-funded ELC provision from birth to six years. Almost all of the 4,000-plus ELC settings registered to deliver the State-funded preschool programme have now been inspected and composite reports and communications designed to support quality improvement have been published. Of particular and positive note is the capacity the inspectorate now has to deliver insights into children’s educational journeys from birth to 18 years-plus.",
                "The Department of children’s responsibilities broadly encompass operational, policy and legislative matters relating to improving access for all children to high-quality, affordable ELC and school-age childcare. A key policy document underpinning this work is First 5. The Department is a key partner in realising many of the objectives of First 5 in respect of promoting positive and successful transitions across and within educational contexts. Curriculum continuity is to the fore in this regard.",
                "Commitments in First 5 also require collaboration across other strategies with cross-departmental relevance. These include the national literacy, numeracy and digital literacy strategy, STEM, education for sustainable development, Creative Ireland and Nurturing Skills, which is the workforce plan for ELC and school-age childcare. We are also working together to devise strategies to promote early acquisition of Irish in recognition of the critical window early childhood offers for natural language learning.",
                "With regard to the topic being discussed today, the integration of early years learning into primary education, the Department has a strong record of collaboration with the Department of children to promote successful transitions for children through the continuum of their education journey, from early learning and care to primary education and on to post-primary education. The Department recognises that successful transitions are particularly important for more vulnerable cohorts of children and have identified, with Department of children colleagues, a range of common areas of action regarding provision for children with additional needs, whether these derive from learning disability or disadvantage.",
                "The most recent initiative to support our objective is the revision of Aistear. On behalf of the Minister for Education, the NCCA has undertaken a full review of this curriculum framework, taking account of the extensive practice and policy developments in the ELC sector since 2009. An updated Aistear framework has been approved by the Minister and the Minister for children and is being readied for publication. Notably, Aistear has been updated at the same time as primary curriculum redevelopment, affording the opportunity for alignment and integration in terms of pedagogy and learning as children move between ELC and primary school.",
                "Primary school education builds on and furthers children's early learning experiences at home and in ELC settings. As almost all children now arrive into primary school having availed of the free programme of ELC, it is timely that the committee is considering how to optimise these early learning experiences into their primary school education. These years are crucial for shaping a child's academic achievements and their social, emotional and cognitive growth. Children learn to collaborate, solve problems and face challenges with confidence, which nurtures their sense of discovery and enthusiasm for learning.",
                "I look forward to engaging with the committee. My colleagues and I will endeavour to answer any questions the committee may have."

This remit enables the council to consider the coherence, continuity and progression of children’s learning from birth, through childhood and into early adulthood. In doing so, the council pays attention to alignment within and across sectors to support continuity and progression in a child’s educational journey while also respecting the distinct nature and identity of each stage and sector.",
                "In May 2021, NCCA began a process to review and update Aistear: The Early Childhood Curriculum Framework. The framework, originally published in 2009, guides the development of an emergent, child-led curriculum in which play and relationships are foundational. Recognising significant changes in early childhood provision in Ireland since 2009 which encompass national developments, policies, strategies, curriculum and assessment advancements, and children's lived experiences and within society more generally, the council embarked on updating the framework. The aim of the update has been to ensure that the framework continues to support high-quality learning and development experiences for babies, toddlers and young children in Ireland in the years ahead.",
                "The work was advanced over two phases from May 2021 to June 2024 through: gathering the views of babies, toddlers and young children, early years educators and parents; involving two wider public consultations; commissioning research; and ongoing deliberation by the council, boards and development groups. As the updating of Aistear has advanced, so too has the redevelopment of the primary school curriculum, and this presented an opportunity to strengthen alignment between the two sectors. This has been realised with the publication of the Primary Curriculum Framework in March 2023, the subsequent development of draft specifications for the redeveloped primary school curriculum and the finalisation of the updated Aistear framework this year.",
                "Alignment between the two frameworks is particularly reflected in the vision, principles and pedagogy described in both.",
                "Within the updated Aistear framework, there is a renewed emphasis on the rights of babies, toddlers and young children, respecting them as agentic, competent and confident individuals. This vision for children is built upon in the primary curriculum framework which aims to provide a strong foundation for every child to thrive and flourish, to support them in realising their full potential, and to view children as unique, competent and caring individuals. The two frameworks are also aligned in the articulation of the principles underpinning both of them, with strong connections in relation to how they describe partnerships with families and communities; relationships and interactions between adults and children, and children and their peers; indoor and outdoor learning environments; transitions across the routines of the day and from the home to preschool through primary and on to post-primary education; and the inclusion of all children by respecting and celebrating diversity. Alignment between the two frameworks is further strengthened with a focus on a pedagogy of play and playful learning experiences. As the redevelopment of the primary school curriculum continues, further opportunities exist to support successful transitions and coherent educational experiences for all children. My colleagues and I are happy to answer questions."

I know the grants for parents are really welcome. My little girl, Lacey, is in the local early years education service in Ardara. She has come on in leaps and bounds. She is three years old. She has not been diagnosed with any special additional needs but the staff get her. I have said to them that she does not like loud sounds and that she questions a lot. The development work that these early educators do with our children is absolutely incredible. As a society, we have come a long way through the work of the Department and other people as well. The homework clubs, which I did not hear the witnesses talk about, are really important. These supports are provided to children who are in primary school. I have a little girl in the homework club. It is an after-school service.

If another two children's services were opened in Ardara, County Donegal, they would be packed to capacity. It is unfortunate that there is not a place for every child. We should make it mandatory that children are entitled to free early education. In light of the importance of early education, this should be a given within the country.

The fact that the uptake rate in respect of the free preschool year is in excess of 96% - this is not to take away from the point the Senator makes - is of major benefit.

I stress how important it is that the State regulates in many areas. I have just mentioned nutrition. There are many areas where the State needs to support parents and this is a vital area of endeavour. However, with regard to values and the potential for confusion, there is a well-founded fear that modern gender ideology undermines a sense of self, which can lead to gender confusion issues arising as children grow up. Proper education requires helping to secure a child's sexual identity in line with his or her sex. To call that into doubt is destructive. For example, the need to distinguish between a child's sense of play and the real world is distorted when someone seeks to make gender identity ideas somehow real to a child. This involves the question of whether children's lives are being experimented with in some way. People do not want to see this happening. That is why I am zooming in on these issues today. Consultation with parents is never as important as it is in this area. Does Dr. Sullivan have a view and will the NCCA vet these early years curricula to make sure there is no such interference? Is he in favour of interpreting diversity, equity and inclusion in such a way as to put all of this stuff on the table? That is what people want to know.",

However, we find ourselves in a peculiar situation whereby, through the ECCE programme, we are starting formal education through what is essentially a privatised setting. While it is funded by the State, much of the provision occurs in childcare settings. Many of these settings provide for younger children and provide after-school care. Is this an ideal situation? We are essentially providing State-led education. Notwithstanding what has been said about inspections and without intending to cast any aspersions on the quality of care we see in childcare settings, which is excellent, I wonder if we are confusing two things. I know excellent education work is done in childcare settings outside of the ECCE programme. However, are we in danger of falling between two stools? We have essentially extended State education into childcare. Even Mr. Tattan said that I should speak to his colleagues in the Department of children about this. Does the current model create confusion? Is this a destination or is it a point on the journey? If it is a point on the journey, where exactly do we want to get to?"

As I was saying just a couple of minutes ago, early years education is at an early stage in its evolution. I do not believe that the journey will ever be complete in either the schools system or the early years system. We are always seeking to improve. During the discussion with committee members in the earlier session, we heard about some of the challenges the schools system faces. As officials, it is incumbent on us to work very closely together, particularly where Government makes a decision as to where early years education and the schools system sit in the structure. It is up to us to ensure that those structures do not stop us achieving the joint outcomes we want to see. As I have said, we work very closely with our colleagues in the Department of children across a range of areas, including the early years area we are talking about now. It is not just that area, however. We work across a whole range of other areas including social inclusion, special education and so on. We will continue to do that. As stated, we want to work together. The recent establishment of the structure at Secretary General level is further evidence of that. In a way, the decision to disband that co-located unit earlier this year is evidence of the integrated way in which we are working. It meant that something like that was past its sell-by date."

When citing research, I should have the citation to hand but, unfortunately, I do not. This research suggested that, whether you start literacy work at four or at seven, the outcomes are broadly the same by the time the child is 12. If I am right on this, and I am sure I will be corrected if I am not, it is madness to spend time on literacy between the ages of four and seven if the outcomes are going to be the same when the children reach 12. I would like to see the focus on gross and fine motor skills, that is, cutting things out, pasting, active play, access to the outdoors, forest schooling and all of those things. Have we gone far enough in interrogating the place of literacy and pre-literacy, particularly in early learning settings?"

With Aistear, there is a specific and intentional focus on learning in the outdoors through the addition of a new aim in the theme of exploring and thinking. It talks about meaningful time outdoors. There are so many playful opportunities for children to engage in when they are outdoors. As with the original framework, the learning goals explain the dispositions, attitudes, values and skills that babies, toddlers and young children can develop. The principle of play builds on this, too, and promotes the blend of free play, guided play and educator-led playful experiences. This is also evidenced in the primary language curriculum through the idea of infusing playfulness through learning experiences. Again we see that language used in the primary maths curriculum, where we have reference to infusing playfulness. This idea of children having plenty of playful and engaging experiences is built on from early years through to primary. It is an important feature. The emphasis being placed on outdoors encourages educators to see the potential in the outdoor environment in terms of connecting with nature, getting to know their community, fostering a sense of belonging and who they are and their role in terms of connecting, caring for themselves, caring for others and caring for the environment."

The vast majority of members of all the curriculum and assessment development groups in NCCA are actually nominated by the partners in education. The NCCA executive, the council, has no role in that membership. Those members come forward from the nominating bodies. In addition, then, in the case of each development group, there are approximately two members who come through what we call a public co-option process whereby we essentially put out a call, an invitation for expressions of interest. They come through and then between two and four members of development groups come through that process. In the case of that process, what we are seeking is to add additional expertise to the development group. Again, it depends on the subject or curriculum area the development group is working on. Those are the two ways in which the membership of each development group is decided. In the case of the junior cycle SPHE development group, it so happened that the members were female."

However, it is important that we would have the NCCA before the committee to talk about the second level curriculum as well. I am very grateful to the witnesses for coming in today but I have to say there are serious questions about aspects of the NCCA’s stewardship. There is sometimes a discordant voice but many people are concerned that, to put it bluntly, NGOs have more access than parents to what is being shaped for the nation's children. This is something the NCCA needs to think about while the Dáil and Seanad are being re-elected."

                "When Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil joined together with the Green Party in coalition four years ago, they promised that it would be the Government to fix housing. This was a very bold claim from the parties that had, in fact, created the housing crisis in the first place. Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have had more than a decade to solve housing but it have only made it worse. Now, as their Government heads for the exit door, their record of failure is clear and people live with it every day.",
                "House prices are through the roof and are far beyond the reach of working people. Rip-off rents are at record levels and continue to soar and tenants are facing the prospect of eviction. A level of homelessness, which we never ever thought we would see, is increasing month after month. While so many struggle to put and keep a secure roof over their heads, the Government's affordable housing schemes make a mockery of the word \"affordable\" by hanging price tags of more than half a million euro on so-called affordable homes in some areas. It has courted and backed vulture and cuckoo funds, promoted build to rent and tolerated the bulk buying of homes from under the noses of first-time buyers. Yet the Taoiseach and Micheál Martin spin the line that the Government has turned the corner on housing. It has not. So far, their Government has delivered fewer homes this year than last year. That is not turning a corner; it is called going backwards.",
                "The Minister, Deputy O'Brien, spent months promising new housing targets but Micheál Martin was not best pleased. After all, joint housing targets simply draw attention to their joint failure. A sham fight ensued with petty politicking and then the Tánaiste buckled. Now, in the dying week of the Government, they have finally set their new housing targets and, lo and behold, they are too low again. They are 20% lower than what the Government's own Housing Commission states is needed. This demonstrates why people cannot afford another government led by Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil because the housing crisis will continue and worsen, house prices, rents and homelessness will continue to increase, thereby leaving more working people locked out of affordable housing and with what choice? The box room of their parent's house or getting fleeced in the rental sector if they can find somewhere or being forced to emigrate. That is what the Government offers.",

I agree housing is the biggest challenge that faces this generation and it must be the number one priority for government, but we are making progress. The Deputy's failure to acknowledge that progress is not borne out by the realities being experienced by people across this country. There are now 500 individuals or couples buying their first home every week. Deputy McDonald never seems to meet these people but I meet them regularly. People are buying houses each and every week, getting their homes, moving out of the box room, moving in with their partner and moving into a place they can start their career from. We have had housing commencement figures that are really quite extraordinary. Construction is now starting on over 49,000 homes so far this year. This is important progress and something that should give cause for optimism.",
                "Of course, all of this is backed up by the largest housing budget ever in budget 2025. This coming year will see a record €6 billion of capital investment in housing. That is up 20% on last year's allocation. In addition to that, unlike Sinn Féin's plans, which would pull the rug from under first-time buyers, we are actually extending the first home scheme out to 2029 and extending the help to buy scheme, which is a scheme that has helped 50,000 first-time buyers. Sinn Féin wants to abolish it for some reason. We are also providing an extra €80 million for the first home scheme as well. We are increasing the renter's tax credit both now and again into next year and today, we agreed housing targets that roughly speaking will see, for every one home that was delivered during the lifetime of this Government, an ability to deliver two over the course of the next five years. That is genuine progress.",

We decided to set housing targets for the next five years to show people how, over the period from now to 2030, we can deliver 303,000 homes, an average of 50,500 a year. That is going to make a real and meaningful difference to people right across this country. Effectively, it will mean a doubling of new housing supply over that time period. That will enable more first-time buyers to buy their homes. It will enable us to provide more social homes than ever before. We are not coming at this from a standing start. Already we are seeing an increase in mortgage drawdowns and in the number of first-time buyers. We are seeing 500 new individuals and couples buying their first home each and every week.

I want to ensure constructive engagement rather than engaging in cheap political shots. That is important. It is fitting that I ask the Taoiseach about the issue that, above all else, has defined his Government's term in office, the housing crisis. This affects every family and every community. It is being raised with us every time we knock on doors. I am sure it is being raised with the Taoiseach as well. We know that everyone should have a home and that this crisis is not new. However, it has been compounded year on year by Government inaction, cementing itself as the civil rights issue of this generation and affecting every generation.",

By any objective standard, its housing plan has failed over that time. Rents, evictions and house prices are up. Tragically, the number of people in homelessness is up and is increasing. The slowness of the Government to take meaningful action on the housing crisis has directly impacted on people's ability to obtain a home and has deprived far too many people of a basic human right. As I said to the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, before the recess, over the past four years, the Government could have acted to prevent renters from eviction by passing the Labour Party's renters' rights Bill. It could have acted to keep children out of homelessness by passing our homeless families Bill. Crucially, it could have increased its targets months ago and sought to build more homes. The single biggest impact the Government could have had would have been through the construction of more social and affordable housing, through transforming the Land Development Agency into a State construction company, as we advocated, and through the setting of higher targets, which could have made a real difference.",
                "For some time now, we have all been aware that the Government's housing targets have been a work of fiction. They have been set too low and, in many cases, have not even been met. Successive Government Ministers have conceded to me for over a year now that the targets were too low. Before we broke for recess, I asked the Minister for housing if he would at last provide the revised higher figures before the general election. He did not commit to doing so then. I genuinely welcome the fact that they have now been published and I welcome the Taoiseach's announcement that they will be much higher. However, keeping the targets so low until now has prevented industry from pivoting towards the construction of homes rather than commercial construction. The slowness in other areas has also contributed to delays in construction output. I refer to slowness to amend the critical skills list. During the Taoiseach's tenure as Minister for higher education, we did not see proper action taken to incentivise people to take up apprenticeships or to stay in them.",

The ramping up of delivery to the necessary targets the Government is now setting has been delayed by the Taoiseach’s delays. We see no additional capital investment for housing in this budget. The Taoiseach must understand he has gone about this in the wrong way. Does he accept his Government has failed and is continuing to fail on housing?"

That anchors the discussion for the weeks ahead. This Government believes we can deliver over 300,000 homes between now and 2030. We have outlined a breakdown of how many we believe can be delivered in each of those years. It will absolutely be up to political parties in their manifestos and in the time ahead in government formation discussions to outline what they believe the mix of that should be in terms of social homes, affordable homes and private-to-buy homes.

Of course, all of that is contingent on a Government that will engage truthfully on this issue, have the credibility to show how it can do so and, of course, an economy which can continue to actually fund the delivery and the building of those houses."

Now, on the week the Dáil is apparently to be dissolved, we see those targets finally being raised. For more than one year, we in the Labour Party have consistently been saying that the targets need to be in the vicinity of 50,000 new builds per year in order to meet the scale of demand. That is what we are hearing every day in our communities and I know the Taoiseach is hearing it too. It is simply too late now to be setting those revised targets with any prospect of making real change in the lifetime of this Government. It is important the Taoiseach acknowledges that at this point for those who are in homelessness and for those who are seeking to achieve their own home."

Being honest, however, nearly the more important part, or at least as important a part, was getting the national planning framework for this. The old version of the national planning framework does not have an ability to deliver that number of homes in terms of land and zoned land across our country. What we have done today, therefore, is not just set the figures for the coming years, which I hope will anchor the discussion, and I appreciate the Deputy's welcome for them, but also put out the national planning framework in a draft form in order that the system can prepare for whoever the Irish people decide to be in government in terms of being ready for that increase in scale. Approximately 40% to 50% of homes being built in this country are somewhat subvented by the taxpayer. That is an incredible level of intervention and is almost unparalleled across the European Union."

                "Throughout the lifetime of the Government, I have emphasised the need to maintain and expand the services that exist for older people within our communities. The Templemore community care project is a group that oversees the provision of a range of vital services, including day care for older people, a community preschool, community social work, family support services, Traveller support services and an invaluable meals on wheels service. The work of this group is the heartbeat of a very wide-ranging community. They provide a lifeline for an ever-growing number of people in Templemore and neighbouring parishes. Services are currently delivered from a premises in the town. Day care attendees range between 75 and 90 years of age. Restrictions on space prevent the extension of services to those aged 65 to 75. One community room acts as both sitting room and dining room, and there are no outdoor recreational areas. Access to physiotherapy and other ancillary services is by chairlift. Underlining this issue of space is the fact that some clients can be catered for only one day a week, with an ever-growing waiting list for places. Existing facilities just about allow for the cooking of meals for the day care attendees and meals on wheels clients. Capacity to meet the ever-growing demand does not exist in the current location.",
                "There is, however, a solution to this situation. In the heart of Templemore is a now vacant convent building occupied by the Sisters of Mercy since 1873. It contains large spaces and stands on 2.5 acres of beautiful grounds. This building, which is in remarkably good condition, provides the perfect setting for the provision of services in the community. The building has the capacity to accommodate and greatly expand key services to support the elderly, children, families and marginalised groups. This former convent, which has overseen the education of a huge percentage of the local population, holds the key to the present and future care of generations to come. The local committee has secured agreement on the purchase of this cherished building. The committee will make the maximum contribution possible towards its purchase. This will be enhanced by the generosity of local people who are conscious of the need for the ongoing and increased provision of invaluable services.",
                "The cost of securing this building cannot be undertaken without financial assistance from the State. The HSE has a duty of care to meet the needs of those served by Templemore community services. Their contribution to its purchase is crucial to its future. I ask the Taoiseach and his officials to engage with the HSE and other State agencies to secure their financial assistance to complete the purchase and alteration of this building. Templemore social services is essentially a voluntary group. On a daily basis, they deliver vital support for older people. The many people from Templemore and surrounding parishes benefit enormously. Those people greatly appreciate the quality of care and attention. The Government, through its agencies, must give practical and financial support to a very deserving project."

                "I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. I wish to begin by expressing my appreciation, and, I am sure, that of everybody in this House, of everybody who has worked or is working or volunteering with Templemore Community Services Centre and indeed day centres right across Ireland. We are lucky to have around 300 day centres and around 300 meals on wheels locations right across the country. I am conscious that some of these organisations are run directly by the HSE, but so many of them, although grant-aided by the HSE, are overwhelmingly run and supported by volunteers with a real Irish sense of meitheal. In answering the Deputy’s question, I take the opportunity to acknowledge and thank people working in Templemore Community Services Centre and all such centres right across Ireland.",
                "I very much noted in his contribution the esteem in which the organisation is held and how vital the services it provides are to the local community. He is right that it is not unfair to say that when organisations provide such vital services, they should expect the State to step up and partner with them to enable delivery. It is not good enough just to thank people; we must try to support them as well.",
                "Having spoken to the Minister for Health on this, I know that Templemore Community Services Centre has expressed an interest in the old Convent of Mercy. I understand the HSE has issued a letter of support to Templemore Community Services Centre in relation to its requirement for additional space to develop its services. The HSE has committed to me that it will engage directly with the centre. Therefore, the need for additional space is acknowledged and supported by the HSE. We very much look forward, as a Government, to doing all we can to support Templemore Community Services Centre in its efforts on this.",
                "The service provides day care services five days per week, with a maximum daily capacity at the site of 20 people. As the Deputy pointed out, the centre needs and wants to do more, and it needs more space to achieve this. The core annual funding for the site is €263,303, which is provided for the provision of the day services and meal collection services. However, we will work with the Deputy and Templemore Community Services Centre to determine whether more progress can be made on advancing its interest in the convent site."

I am very familiar with the local group who work behind the scenes. They are very dedicated, committed and hard-working. I have met them on several occasions. Their determination to continue to see their work benefit the community is inspiring. I have given the committee much time and advice and I am convinced of the merits of the project. We have to ensure the centre gets some capital funding to make sure the project comes to fruition. When the HSE provides a report to the Department, some financial support should be granted to allow the project to proceed."

I hope we have shown good faith in this regard over recent years through what we have invested in older people’s services. In fact, the budget for 2025 will bring investment in older people’s services next year close to €3 billion, representing an increase of €349 million on the figure for this year. We have increased the budget for older people’s services by approximately 50% in the lifetime of the Government, and I hope that shows the value we attach to caring for older people in our community. We will continue to keep a close eye on this."

Waiting for assessments for children with autism, ADHD and mental health issues has to be dealt with urgently as early intervention is paramount for these children. Yesterday, I received a response to a parliamentary question I sent to the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, stating that the current waiting time is 30 months. God almighty, is that what the Taoiseach is presiding over? Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Green Party are joined together. The Taoiseach told people in Kerry during his speedy trip around it that he had a way out of this and he would appoint another Minister instead of Deputy Donnelly when the election was over. Do not laugh. I could bring the man the Taoiseach told here. It would be no bother in the world.",

It is a hell of a lot larger than when I was Minister for Health. It has now gone from about €16 billion to about €25 billion. The truth also matters. We have funding in place now to hire thousands more people to work in the health service under the leadership of the Minister, Deputy Donnelly. As of September 2024, there were 27,744 more staff working in the health service than there were when this Government of Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Green Party came into office. That is a 23% increase. There are 9,185 more nurses and midwives, 4,160 more health and social care professionals and 3,479 more doctors and dentists. I will get the Deputy the figures but I have no doubt that in Kerry hospital this means more staff, nurses and doctors than there were only a few years ago.",

That is why my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, has a piece of work that will be concluded by the end of the year relating to the means testing of our carers."

When is the Government going to react and lift the embargo? The facts are that day after day, young boys and girls who are trained to be nurses, carers and GPs are leaving the country because there has been an embargo in place for 12 months, since last November. The Taoiseach cannot deny it. It has happened and is happening. So many posts are unfilled and so many beds are empty because you cannot have beds if you do not have staff to fill them. That is what is happening. Even as we speak, these young people are flying out. We are calling for beds. There was not even an ICU bed to be got yesterday in most of the country, except for up here in Dublin. The Minister, Deputy Donnelly, said he had reduced the waiting time for cataract procedures from three years to three months in Dublin. What has the Government done in Kerry? It closed down our unit and cancelled the insurance so they could not act. It was utterly criminal. That is the gospel truth."

These financial burdens are nearly impossible to escape, leaving little room to address the pressing needs of their populations. Without significant debt relief, these countries will struggle to provide basic services, let alone tackle climate change. Targeted support from nations like Ireland through institutions such as the IMF could make a profound impact. Thoughtfully designed assistance could ensure climate mitigation and adaptation are prioritised in global aid efforts. For example, a debt-for-climate swap, where debt is reduced in exchange for commitments to environmental action offers a pathway to address both economic and ecological crises, giving vulnerable countries a fair chance to adapt to the changing world. We need to have a debate on that in the House."

We do not have Garda members on the ground to react to people when they need them. Members of the public always support the Garda but they need the Garda to support them also. The numbers do not allow Garda members to give the support to the people that they want to give. All the officers want to do their job and serve the people. Members of the Garda are often brought up to Dublin when there are demonstrations here and the country is left without them. It was never as bad in south Tipperary, in Clonmel, Carrick-on-Suir, Cashel, Tipperary town and the outlying areas. It is just not fair to people. They expect a service from the Garda, which gardaí want to give, but they cannot, as they do not have the numbers."

The Taoiseach should do the right thing and allow the Bill to proceed through Committee Stage in the next few days and make sure it is passed before the election because I know, unfortunately - as does the Taoiseach if he would only admit it - that if we wait until the next Government it will be five years down the line and we will still be waiting for it. That is the reality of the situation. The Government should do it now when the whole Dáil is in favour of it. It should put it through committee and we can pass it before tomorrow night."

Shaw is serving a life sentence and is before the Parole Board for review. Shaw was never convicted of Elizabeth's murder. He was convicted of Mary Duffy's murder, but Elizabeth Plunkett's family are not legally regarded as victims within the Parole Board process. The family only learned of this heartbreaking news several months into the process, much to their distress. This anomaly must be addressed to protect the rights of victims' families. To compound the shocking injustice to the Plunkett family, it transpires further that an inquest was never held into their sister's death nor was a death certificate issued. Elizabeth's family, constituents of mine, have asked me now to make public their plight today for the first time since the murder of their sister nearly 50 years ago. They have asked me to make a specific request of the Taoiseach that the Government would commit to providing sufficient resources to enable the coroner in Wexford, where Elizabeth's body was found, to carry out the long-overdue inquest without delay."

I want to know how many of these homes in these revised targets will be affordable. Will the Government be clear about that? I ask the question because it has missed its inadequate social and affordable housing targets every single year. Meanwhile, house prices are in the stratosphere. Since this Government took office, the price of an average home has increased by €85,000. That is more than €20,000 per year.",

I have met mothers who were told their children could be as old as four before it is hoped they can be seen. I met two families yesterday while out canvassing who were told it would possibly be two years before their four-month-old children are seen. A gentleman came in yesterday about his elderly neighbour who has gone home from St. James's Hospital twice this year and had no public health nurses to back her up. This is a critical issue for young families in the area and I have seen no progress on it. On 18 April, the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, said it is not a funding issue or a moratorium issue, but it is due to a lack of public health nurses. Brian Kearney, head of primary care, responded to a parliamentary question by saying there has been \"an ongoing challenge in relation to the recruitment of these key posts and the service currently does not have approval to recruit\". There is a contradiction here somewhere and I need to get an answer because families and elderly people in the Dublin 12 and Dublin 8 area need to be looked after."

I appeal to the Taoiseach in this election campaign to have a look at the position of his party. Fianna Fáil will speak for itself. We need to have a scheme similar to what Dublin and north Leinster got for pyrite. There people got 100% redress and were able to get on with their lives. I ask the Taoiseach to please trust me when I tell him most families who are eligible for the scheme in Donegal cannot avail of it because they cannot afford to. I am asking him to urgently review this and take an approach that means no matter where people live, if they are victims, they get 100% redress."

Even a one-cow farm is being inspected. The inspections are being driven by water quality. Where pollution and noncompliance are identified, there are penalties and immediate action is expected to be taken. It is reasonable enough that immediate action would be taken if there is pollution, but further along the very same riverbank, Dunmanway wastewater treatment plant is polluting the same water body. \"Prime Time\" conducted a programme on this recently and it is very frustrating for farmers who find they are not being treated equally. Why are all farms in the area being inspected one after the other and are all polluters, including Irish Water, going to be expected to take immediate action and upgrade?"

                "In page 9, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:",
                "“ “investment undertaking” includes a retail credit firm as defined in section 28 of the Central Bank Act 1997 and any other person who owns credit which is being serviced by a credit servicer as defined in section 28(2) of that Act.”.",
                "I am very concerned about the lack of time allowed for this debate. While I know there is a big event taking place, that does not give the Government impunity to enact this Bill with such indecent haste and without teasing out the many matters. This amendment is important. The former Minister, Michael Noonan, invited the vulture funds to Ireland. It is high time that someone uninvited them and sent them home because they have caused plunder and pillage. There is an old song about plunder and pillage in Van Diemen's Land. It is unbelievable what the vulture funds have got away with at that time. They should never have been here. I will use a parallel, although I hate using it because it is very cruel. My son is a sheep farmer and when little lambs are born, grey crows and vultures come down and take their tongues and eyes savagely. The very word \"vulture\" is anathema to any right-thinking person. Vulture funds are not interested in supporting the Irish people or anything else.",
                "I hope the Government will accept this amendment, although I have doubts. The amendment would ensure some bit of respect, manners and common decency are put in around the rules of engagement. Every taxpayer and citizen in this country has to do a tax return but the vulture funds are immune to all of that. Why should they be? People’s dreams are being shattered by what has happened to them. They borrowed in good faith to house themselves, buy a bit of land or go into business, which is what we need. We need entrepreneurs and people who are able to house themselves, rather than putting the law about ag lorg aid and help. They want to do this for themselves and their families and to provide a roof over their heads. Their debt is sold off by the pillar banks and other banks such as Ulster Bank - I could name all the banks - to the vulture funds for a fraction. In many cases, people wanted to pay the debt but it was unceremoniously disposed of and they were then left at the mercy of the vulture funds.",
                "As for the Land Registry, which is located trasna na habhann, across the river, it is completely inept and totally out of order in how it deals with the proper ownership of the title of most of the places. In 90% of cases in which homes, farms and businesses are being repossessed, the Land Registry is way out of line. Barristers are going into courts on behalf of the vulture funds waving pieces of paper at the justices but the judges are not asking them whether it is legal. It is not legal. I could quote Edmund Honohan, the highly respected former Master of the High Court, in this regard. I also welcome to the House Theo McDonald who did a wonderful analysis on this issue in the McDonald report, but the Minister, who is a new Minister, does not want to hear that either. I am very disappointed.",
                "Vulture funds are investment entities which purchase distressed debt at a discount, often from struggling companies or individuals. They then seek to profit by collecting the full value of the debt, sometimes through aggressive and unethical tactics. Credit services are intermediaries and manage these debts. There is no mercy in the courts. I have yet to see cases, except for a couple of judgments, in which these merciless vulture funds were delayed.",
                "One of the points on which we feel very strongly in the context of this amendment is the issue of tax evasion. Vulture funds often use credit services to avoid paying taxes by operating through these intermediaries. They can shift profits offshore to minimise their tax liabilities. This deprives our country of much-needed revenue that could be used for badly needed public services. I cannot understand why the Government has na súile dúnta, its eyes closed, to this since the crash in 2009 and has not brought the vulture funds to book. Why is it beholden to them?",
                "There is a cosy cartel of consultancy firms. The Government uses many of these firms for every kind of a report and investigation. The same consultancy firms and accountants are advising these merciless vulture funds on how to utilise tax loopholes. They are all in it together.",
                "The ordinary people of Ireland, for whom the men of 1916, 1921, 1922 and 1923 fought in order to have democracy in Ireland, have been abandoned. People's lives are being lost. So many people have taken their own lives, so many families have been destroyed, so many marriages have broken up and there is so much ill health and so many mental health issues, it is unbelievable. The Minister is hearing this gach lá. He must be hearing it, as must his backbenchers. Yet, he comes in here and lets the vulture funds off scot-free. It is grossly immoral, unethical and unfair to allow these vulture funds to operate with such impunity.",
                "I thank the iar-Sheanadóir, Brian Ó Domhnaill, for undertaking the research on policy, with help from Edmund Honohan and others. I also congratulate him on the sporting prowess he has shown and his recent achievements in education.",
                "As I said, vulture funds are known for their aggressive tactics in collecting debts. They often target vulnerable borrowers using legal threats and other pressure tactics to exact payments. This can lead to significant financial and emotional distress. Think of the children. While Deputy Chambers was not the Minister for Finance at the time, there were many cases in which mercenaries from other countries came to Ireland to inflict and carry out evictions without proper legal work. We have seen their vehicles being parked in Balbriggan Garda Station. We have seen what happened in Roscommon. We have seen this all over the country. These people have no business in this country. They are not even registered security people and they are causing bedlam and injury. They are causing people to perish. We thought we got rid of those tactics when we got rid of the oppressive regime that was here for many hundreds of years.",
                "The economic aspect is totally unchecked. The operation of the vulture funds can have a broader economic impact. By focusing on short-term profits, they can destabilise companies and economies, leading to job losses and economic instability. It is as clear as the nose on your face that this can happen. It beggars belief.",
                "Let us look at some real-life examples to understand the human impact. Humans and humanity must be what every Teachta Dála and Seanadóir is about. The practices used are awful. For example, Pepper Finance is one of the most notorious services in Ireland. It has been involved in several high-profile cases in which borrowers have been charged exorbitant interest rates. For instance, a couple in Cork sued Pepper Finance over an excessive interest rate of 8.5% on their mortgage, which was significantly higher than the rate they would have paid if their loan had remained with the original lender. In business, I sign a lot of agreements for the purchase of vehicles. While we need finance houses to support business, if people sign an agreement with some institution, surely their contract is with it and should not be sold on to these merciless vulture funds which are here to make massive profits and do not care about the collateral damage. As I said, that is one case but there are many others.",
                "Some 100,000 mortgages in Ireland have been sold to vulture funds, leaving families, sometimes extended families, in awful situations.",
                "Borrowers are trapped in high-interest loans with little recourse. These \"mortgage prisoners\" are often unable to refinance or switch to more favourable terms, leading to financial hardship. Some 700,000 people have mortgages, of which 100,000 are with vulture funds. That is an enormous number to be with vulture funds. It is time we got rid of them. The Minister has a golden opportunity in the last hours of this dying Dáil, before an election is called, to do something meaningful for the people out there, many of whom are the enablers who provide employment or who set up their own businesses and took a punt. We need those people to take a gamble. They do not all have cosy positions in the public service. Then there are the others who tried to house themselves and borrowed and have been badly stung. They cannot get any finance from any source because they feature in the credit bureau.",
                "There are significant gaps in the regulatory framework that allow vulture funds and their credit services to operate with minimal oversight. The lack of stringent regulations and enforcement has enabled these entities to exploit borrowers and avoid accountability. That is shocking. We are reminded of 2010, and we found out about that, but now it is 2024 and they are still exploiting the gaps and still using every kind of loophole, whether legal or illegal, as regards the land registry.",
                "The Government's economic policies have often favoured financial institutions and investment funds over ordinary citizens. How can that be right in our so-called land of milk and honey? It is our duty as Teachtaí Dála, messengers of the people, to serve our Irish people and not be kowtowing to vulture funds, which have no interest here. They will be gone like snow off a ditch from this country when they have reaped all their gains, blood money in many cases. It is taken wrong. They have so many undertakings and they must be sorted out. The guidance notes refer to a collective investment vehicle, such as a UCIT. The amendment inserts a definition of \"investment undertaking\" that fits this context. It is plain and simple. It is beyond time we called these vulture funds to book and tried to save more lives and more families. They cost our health service because of the illness and the depraved manner in which they operate. The Minister's advisers are here again, and some of the big financial houses in this country are insisting that he keep this policy. They are also, on the other hand, working for these vulture funds. That is totally wrong and reprehensible. The citizens, or the borrowers, are way down the food chain. They are last, whether they be householders or businesspeople.",
                "I know we do not have much time. I could say an awful lot more, but the message is simple. I ask the Minister to accept this amendment and, at this late stage, the horse having bolted many years ago, for the sake of the future generations of families, try to bring some order to this Wild West that has been allowed to operate here in dealing with finances. No other sector or businessperson or whatever can operate without being under the strict regime of Revenue and taxation laws. Why should we allow these people to get off scot-free?"

                "Obviously, we are all waiting for the whistle to be blown in terms of the election. In my time in these Houses, I think this is the 18th Finance Bill I have responded to. Even during the time of the IMF bailout, there was agreement to get the Finance Bill through the House. This guillotine is not appropriate. There are sections in this legislation which will not see the light of day in terms of scrutiny. There were major mistakes that the Minister is closing down in this Bill. For example, his predecessor, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, left a loophole in the Bill in terms of pensions whereby millions of euro were funnelled out of companies into pension funds. I pointed that out to him at the time and he ignored it, as did his predecessor, the Minister, Michael McGrath, when I raised it in a Topical Issue earlier this year, and now this is being closed down in this Bill. I raise that because it is important that we have proper scrutiny of this legislation.",
                "A lot of important pieces of our tax law are being dealt with, including major issues such as pillar 1 and pillar 2 of the OECD BEPS agreement. There are also issues that, as I have mentioned before, the Minister has never even mentioned on the floor of the Dáil. In my time dealing with 18 different Finance Bills, never has there been legislation that granted an income tax reduction of €320,000 to an individual. That is what is contained in this Bill through the Minister's changes to the standard fund threshold, where individuals who already have golden pension pots of €2 million will, as a result of the measures the Minister is introducing, between now and 2028, be able to avail of a pension tax cut of €320,000. Very few people in society will be able to benefit from that. The report the Minister published suggests that only those in the public sector who earn €170,000, which would be Ministers, taoisigh and so on, would benefit from this tax reduction the Government signed off on. It is appalling that it has done that and it is unlikely that the measure will get any serious scrutiny.",
                "There are other issues with this Bill. In section 36, for example, the Government doubles down on the landlords' credit. There is a tax cut of €120 million for landlords at a time when the Minister is being told by Barra Roantree that it is the stupidest tax cut ever \"against stiff competition\". This is a professor, who has made this point over and over again. Yet this is Fianna Fáil again doing what Fianna Fáil does, and it is very clear in this legislation that there are very clear winners. Yes, there are bits and pieces for others, but those bits and pieces are hundreds of euro here and there. The real winners - let us call a spade a spade - are the people with pension pots of more than €2 million. They win under Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. They win the lotto in this legislation. They get a tax cut of €320,000 as a result of this legislation. The landlords win in this legislation. They shared a tax reduction of €120 million, despite the Minister's officials telling him that this will leave half of landlords in the State paying no tax.",
                "As a previous speaker said, it is also the funds that win. The funds continue to win under Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, and no wonder. Let us just look at the statistics. On a day when the Government released new targets that are abysmally low, let us look at what has happened over the last five years. Why does it happen? It happens because it is contained in the Finance Bills that have been passed over the years. We see that last year 6,203 apartments were bought by funds. That is four times what was being bought by these funds before this Government came into office four years ago. Before Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael came into office on that occasion, there were four times fewer purchases of apartments by funds. It is not just that Noonan rolled out the red carpet; the present Government basically said, \"Party on, guys, and you snap up the building going on here.\" Over half of all apartments in this State in 2023 were bought by funds. Those are the facts. There were 741 apartments bought the year before Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil entered government together. What is the number today? It is 846. It went up by just over a miserable 100 apartment units. Why is that? It is because the funds have increased their grip by nearly 5,000 additional apartments.",
                "That is what is happening, and that is what is contained in the Bill. That is what the Government will vote for when it votes against these amendments, when we say to the Government that it is not fair that those funds, which are charging eye-watering rents in the Minister's city of Dublin, and elsewhere, pay no tax whatsoever in that rental role, that when they dispose of an asset they do not pay capital gains tax on the disposal of that asset and that the effective tax rate is minimal. The Government will say it will increase stamp duty on bulk purchases but it does not apply to apartments because in Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael's little world, apartments are not homes. Funds, however, are not just buying apartments; they are also buying other homes.",
                "The numbers I have put on the record relate to apartments only. Although the funds are continuing to snap up many hundreds of homes every year, the Minister has come forward with the pathetic increase in stamp duty and has said it will stamp it out. It will not. If the Minister really wanted to stamp it out, he would not be saying the increase will bring in revenue. The only way it can bring in revenue is through the funds paying the additional tax. We do not want their tax. We do not want them to be bulk purchasing homes from under the noses of first-time buyers. That is the problem with guillotining this legislation and, more important, with the legislation in the first instance."

                "To speak about the amendment tabled, the specific wording proposed by the Deputies would have no effect if incorporated into the Finance Bill. For this reason, I cannot accept it. The proposed amendment is to section 1, which provides for the meaning of words in Part 1. Inserting a definition here does not change the meaning of words in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 and, as such, the proposed amendment does not change the operation of this Act.",
                "My officials followed up with the Deputies’ offices following receipt of the proposed amendment with a view to understanding the intended policy outcome. I understand that their proposals may relate to credit servicing firms involved in servicing portfolios of residential loans, including mortgage loans. Any entity that services credit under a mortgage agreement entered into by a consumer falls within the regulatory remit of the Central Bank. Any entity that holds the legal title to credit granted under a credit agreement with a borrower is also subject to the regulatory oversight of the Central Bank. Accordingly, the full legislative and consumer protection framework covers all borrowers, whether their mortgages are managed by a credit servicer or by entities that purchase the legal rights of the creditor under mortgage agreements. This means that where a creditor sells or assigns its legal rights under a credit agreement to another creditor, the consumer protections that were available to borrowers prior to such a transaction remain in place. There is a range of measures to protect consumers who have a mortgage, including the various Central Bank statutory codes of conduct, such as the consumer protection code and the code of conduct on mortgage arrears.",
                "With regard to tax returns, as referred to here, all companies that run a taxable business in Ireland must file an annual tax return with the Revenue Commissioners. As part of that tax return, many companies are required to provide full financial statements in iXBRL format, and the Revenue Commissioners can request full financial statements from those that do not have this filing requirement. There are also long-standing provisions in tax law that place a reporting obligation on a person in receipt of income of more than €3,810 on behalf of another person and under which a non-resident can be charged tax in the name of an agent in the State who carries on the business of that non-resident. The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that where any information required by them is not disclosed in the tax return or financial statements, they have sufficient powers to request the production of any appropriate books or records to satisfy them as to the accuracy of any tax return.",
                "I recognise the difficulties faced by borrowers experiencing difficulty in repaying their mortgages. The tax and expenditure measures in budget 2025 are designed to assist in dealing with increased costs of living. It is encouraging to note that the overall level of mortgage arrears continues to decline and the number of principal home mortgage accounts in long-term arrears at the end of June was a little over 20,000, down from 30,000 in December 2020. The Government has always advocated for the broadest regulatory and consumer protection regime possible and will continue to do so.",
                "Where a loan is sold, the terms and conditions will not change and the rights and obligations of all parties to the mortgage agreement will remain unchanged. I set that out in the context of what Deputy McGrath has asked about. There is a robust framework in place to protect people dealing with issues such as mortgage arrears. The code of conduct on mortgage arrears, CCMA, forms part of the Central Bank’s consumer protection framework and is a key part of the Central Bank’s mortgage arrears framework. The CCMA must be complied with under the law and the Central Bank has the power to take enforcement action against any regulated entity that does not act in compliance with it. The Central Bank continues to supervise compliance with the CCMA and will investigate any issues that arise, including patterns of behaviour that suggest the code is not being followed.",
                "The objective of the statutory code is to ensure regulated entities have fair and transparent processes in place for dealing with borrowers in or facing mortgage arrears. Due regard must be given to the facts of each case, and each needs to be considered on its own merit. Each regulated entity must consider the borrowers’ situations in the context of the solutions it provides, which may differ from firm to firm. The CCMA requires lenders to exhaust the options available from the suite of alternative repayment arrangements offered by them before taking action that may result in follow-on consequences. The CCMA requires regulated entities to have an appeals process in place to enable a borrower to appeal a decision by a regulated entity, including where the borrower is not willing to enter into an alternative repayment arrangement or where the regulated entity declines to offer an alternative repayment arrangement. The appeals procedure must be such as to inform borrowers of their right to refer the matter to the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman.",
                "On tax policy, there are no special tax rules related to credit services firms. As such, they are subject to the same taxation rules as any other company carrying on a business in Ireland. This includes the rules in relation to the calculation of profits and gain, the obligation to provide Revenue with financial statements and the obligations to make tax returns or return information in respect of income collected on behalf of third parties. As such, I am not in a position to accept the amendment."

There absolutely was, however, a fairer way to do that. We in Sinn Féin have put on the record that if we have the opportunity to lead the next Government, we will exempt the first €45,000 of income that everybody in the State earns from the USC tax net. That means the average worker in the State will never have to pay the USC ever again under a Sinn Féin-led Government. That is the type of approach the Minister should have brought forward in this legislation and that measure should have been done in two steps. First, the threshold should have been set at €30,000 for the USC tax net and then moved to €45,000, which can be delivered within 18 months of a general election. That is something many people would welcome.",

If you are on €40,000, it will be €159. Compare that to the sections we probably will not even get to discuss. As I said, the people who run around with Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael and the people who have the gold-plated pensions will benefit. They will not benefit by €59 or €159 but will benefit to the tune of €320,000 as a tax cut. I am talking about the lowest-income workers, for whom the Minister could have done something meaningful.

It is increasing by 80 cent per hour, that is, from €12.70 per hour to €13.50 per hour, with effect from 1 January 2025. This continues the Government's policy of ensuring full-time workers on the minimum wage will remain outside the charge of the top rates of USC. Accordingly, the ceiling of the 2% USC rate band will increase by 6.3%, from €25,760 to €27,382 with effect from 1 January 2025. Second, the 4% rate of USC will be reduced to 3%. This represents the second consecutive reduction to this rate. This change will benefit all those earning over €27,382 in 2025.

Let us take the wider changes we have seen in the context of a single person employee and their average effective tax rate. In 2020, a person on €25,000 was paying 12.4%; in 2025, 9.4% will be their average effective tax rate. Someone on €35,000 was paying 17.1%; next year that will be 14.4%. Someone on €40,000 was paying 20.9% in 2020 and will pay 16% in 2025. These are clearly progressive changes. Reducing the income tax burden and the USC have been central to what this Government has designed and delivered in the context of our overall tax package and this reduction in USC will be important in the overall tax people pay in 2025 and it is a welcome change."

I remember when it was, to quote the late Albert Reynolds, \"a temporary little arrangement\".

You can fool some of the people some of the time, but if you fool all of the people all of the time, it is a serious situation for our democracy. The Minister did not make those promises, but his party leader and the party he is a member of did, as did the Government in which he was a Minister of State. They think they can pass the Bill with a small bit of tinkering around it to save a bit of face. It is not acceptable or good enough. A supposedly temporary tax was put on all those years ago, and this punitive tax has become part of the mechanism of getting tax from ordinary hardworking people trying to survive and live and pay their debts and bills and educate their families.

However, as the CSO tells us, that excludes everybody who works fewer than 50 weeks. There are people in all of our constituencies, whether they are the school caretaker or otherwise, who do not work 50 weeks due to the nature of their employment. When all employment is taken into account, the average weekly amount earned is €699. Therefore, if that were annualised, it would be €36,400. That is the CSO data. It tells us that the average weekly earnings of all workers amount to €36,400 annually. If we just take workers who work at least 50 weeks per year, then it is €43,221. That excludes a lot of workers as I have said. What is the Minister's definition of \"median\"?",

Is it a Fianna Fáil internal definition?

Someone on €35,000 has gone from 17.1% to 14.4%. Someone on €40,000 has gone from 20.9% to 16%. Someone on €50,000 has gone from 26.4% to 20.6%. I can go on. It demonstrates the progressivity of all the tax changes we have made across a number of budgets. In budget 2025, the adjustments to personal tax credits of €125 will benefit a lot of low- and middle-income workers. The cumulative changes we have made to USC over two years from 4.5% to 3% will significantly benefit low- and middle-income workers. This demonstrates the progressivity of the overall tax system. It is also important to adjust the point at which people enter the higher rate of tax, and that is why we sought to increase the band from €42,000 to €44,000.",

The design of our income tax package was focused on reducing USC from 4% to 3% - a welcome change for many workers in our economy. There were changes to personal tax credits and the standard rate. Is it the Deputy's preference to leave the standard rate and not reward work in our economy? Is that his position? This was welcomed by many workers across our economy who have seen their wages rise and who want to be rewarded for the work they do. That is why it was important to get a blend of all three measures for workers across our economy. It is demonstrated in the progressivity of the changes I have referenced. Taking the cumulative impact of the tax package this Government has made, the effective tax rate is 9.4% for someone on €25,000 and significantly increases across higher income streams. It demonstrates the wider progressivity of the decisions we have taken from the perspective of income tax."

If I get the opportunity to sit where he is, as Minister for Finance, I will abolish the USC for average workers across the State. I will ensure that average workers never pay a tax introduced at that time by Fianna Fáil. I will ensure every worker benefits from that because the first €45,000 will be exempt from USC. That is what I will do, and I will make sure it is done within the first two years of government. That is the answer to the Minister's question, and that would be fair because everybody would benefit, particularly those on low and middle incomes. He said his tax proposals are progressive, so somebody on €30,000 benefits to the tune of €59 while somebody on €75,000 benefits by €459. Is it progressive that somebody with less than half the wages of somebody else gets eight times less of a tax cut? That is not my definition of \"progressive\". It is interesting that he says he is using the mean. The Minister knows, because he is an intelligent person, that median means half of all workers are on one side and half are on the other side and the median income is way less than the mean.",

He has taken the wages of all employees in the State, including those who make a lot of money, and divided the total by the number of employees. That is the mean. The median is a better indicator of where the population is. Half of the population of workers earn less than €36,400 and half of them earn more than €36,400 if we take all types of employment. If we take only those who are working 50 weeks or more, half of all workers earn less than €43,200 and half of all workers earn more than that. That is what middle income means. The point is that half of workers are excluded from the Government's major tax package introduced in the budget. That is fact. It introduced something that is blatantly unfair to people who are seriously struggling. That is just a fact.",
                "Does the Minister not accept that median is the calculation that should be used to find the middle figure, where we are in terms of the population of workers? How many earn more than this number and how many earn less than this number? The median calculation is what the Minister should use. Otherwise, he is just trying to create an impression. Half of the country does not earn this money. Half the country earns less than €36,000, which is what the CSO tells us according to 2023 figures. It may have increased a bit in 2024, but it is not anywhere near the Minister's €50,000 figure. If he really believes that, he does not have a sense of where people are really at."

I cannot understand the methodology at all in refusing to do this. Several cases were made for it. Why in the name of God did the Government ignore these people? These are people who have been in business for many years. There has never been more of a market falling away than this year and they were trying to keep going until the end of the year to see whether the Government would give them some lift or perk. It did not. It buried them and they cannot face the time after Christmas. Some of them will probably stay on until Christmas, but a lot of them will be gone by the new year.

Even if we were to use the median, the CSO figures published today show it is €43,000 for 2023. It is likely to be higher in 2024 and higher again in 2025, so many of the workers the Deputy referred to will benefit from the change I have made in budget 2025. They will benefit from the standard rate being adjusted upwards. They will be taken out of the higher rate of income tax. That will be of benefit to those earning between €42,000 and €44,000.",

That is why the Government introduced a power up grant to support businesses, especially energy costs for retail and the hospitality sector."

I never object to that. There is no difference now in the spots on the leopard. They are the very same. Fine Gael is in government with Fianna Fáil, and in its manifesto it committed to abolishing the USC. It also agreed a programme for Government with Fianna Fáil. Fianna Fáil supported Fine Gael four years before that in the confidence and supply agreement. The parties have been together for nearly ten years. The parties all supported the USC at the time it was introduced. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are two sides of the same coin.",
                "This tax is so punitive, it acts as a disincentive to people going to work. I am tired of saying this but I am a self-employed person and I have employed people. It must be rewarding for people to go to work, no matter what job it is. People must have a sense of pride in what they do. There is no point if it becomes unviable. People have a desire to get a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. They want to derive satisfaction from it and play their part in their country and nation and provide for themselves and their family. That is a noble vision and aspiration for anybody, but not when the Minister taxes them like this and then reneges on the Government's promise to abolish the USC. It is like the Taoiseach telling us since he became Taoiseach that the Government would run the full term, yet he admitted this morning for the first time that he is going to call the election this week. What kind of message does that send to the public? It is that we cannot believe aon focal or dhá focal, like in the song by Richie Kavanagh. We cannot believe any word from the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste or the Cabinet.",
                "This tax is regressive and punitive on people on lower incomes. While the Minister has removed some of those on lower incomes, there are many other people in middle Ireland who pay for everything. They do not qualify for local authority housing or Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grants. They do not qualify for medical cards, dental repairs or any kind of treatment for their children or themselves. They are trapped in a situation whereby they have to pay for everything. They can get no supports of any shape, make or form whether they go to the hospital or the doctor. They cannot get a medical card or doctor-only card. They cannot get anything.",
                "These are the people the Government talks about and patronises. The previous Fine Gael Taoiseach - I genuinely struggle now to differentiate Fine Gael from Fianna Fáil - Deputy Varadkar, said he wanted to support the people who get up early in the morning. The Government is not supporting them in any shape, make or form. They get up an luath ar fad. They get up in the morning and go to work. I meet them. I am canvassing them. The Minister is canvassing them so he must be meeting them. They are the two types of people I meet who are so downtrodden and disappointed in the country and its future. They lack confidence in it and many of them will not vote at all because of this situation. They work all day long.",

She pays €1,300 a month in rent in the village of Kilsheelan near Clonmel. She has to travel to work. She and her husband are trying to get a deposit together, so that they will have some hope of putting a home together for themselves. If they were paying that amount of money in a mortgage, they would be on the road to somewhere, but that is not the case. They are so downtrodden and trapped. She and her husband both work. They have two lovely small children. It is a noble aspiration to have a family like that. They are downtrodden with tax. They must pay for everything and they get nothing. This budget did nothing at all for them.",
                "It did nothing for that large cohort of people. I accept there were double payments for people on social welfare, pensioners and many others, which was an unashamedly naked effort to buy votes. The election is being called now when those payments are settled in and there is a feelgood factor for people. That money will go like snow off a ditch. They will sit there in Kilsheelan, right under the Comeragh Mountains. It is a cold and bleak place in the winter. We had lovely weather this week but we are going to have cold weather, heating bills, maintenance and everything else. Many people have difficult landlords.",
                "There is another cohort of people I meet, who I am sure all present meet. I visited a private estate where the saddest thing is that in most of the houses the parents were alone and the family is imithe, gone all over the world, to Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Hong Kong. There is no sign of many of them coming back. I have 11 beautiful grandchildren, so I know what it is like to have grandchildren in all of those places. These people are saving up to go to Australia to see them. These young people are our brightest and best. The hope and dream for them was that they would grow up and be able to support them in their autumnal years, and they would be able to be around them, but they are gone. That is the case in house after house. There are tears in the eyes of some of the people.",
                "It is so sad that Ireland today is doing this. We are not looking after our own. These are the brain pool, the enablers and the highly educated ones we need in the economy and in the country but they are going. More are going all the time. The Minister is offering them no hope in this budget. He is offering no hope whatsoever with the USC. They are being crucified with tax. They are not able to get any supports or to get on the property ladder. Is mór an trua an rud sin: na daoine óige imithe, trasna an domhan. Their parents are left at home, some ageing and ill. Some are crying. Some parents are saving up to go on the long flights to Australia, Hong Kong and other places - to a strange land they never had any desire to visit.",
                "They feel they have to go to see their adult children and their grandchildren. That is a noble thing to be able to do as well. I am fortunate that nine of my grandchildren are within a mile of me and the other two, God bless them, are only 13 miles away. It is so sad. We are all meeting those people and we are going to meet many more of them as we go out knocking on the doors. What do we say to them?"

                "-----on the commitment to do so. People Before Profit has been very consistent in its view on the USC since entering this Dáil in 2011, which is that it was a grossly unfair austerity imposition on working people to pay for the crimes of the bankers and property developers who put this country over a cliff in 2008. Workers got it in the neck and were asked to pay for the crimes of others but it was supposed to be a temporary austerity measure. Workers were promised that it would go when the crisis had passed but that promise has been reneged upon. Anybody who thinks that workers out there are not still very sore about that fact is not talking to workers. Anybody who is talking to them knows that is the truth. They are very angry and bitter about the fact that every week or every month when they get their pay cheque there is a little thing in brackets, the \"universal social charge\", which takes a big chunk out of their wages, that was supposed to be temporary and through which they were paying for the crimes of others. Despite the promises and commitments and despite the fact that this economy has generated a record budget surplus of €24 billion, plus €13 billion in windfall tax from Apple, apparently the Government still cannot keep its promise to get rid of this temporary, emergency unfair tax on working people. It is the working people who generated that surplus. That is who generated it. Surpluses do not pop out of the sky. The surplus in the Irish economy has been generated by the hard work of working people in this country. Even now, when they are generating a record surplus, the Government will not honour its commitment to get rid of the universal social charge. The reason is that it wants to give the benefits of the surplus, the unprecedented wealth that is being generated in this country, to the super-rich, the multimillionaires, the billionaires and the corporations who are enjoying a bonanza in profits and an unprecedented growth in their personal wealth. That is the truth. The Government has robbed the poor to pay the rich and that is why it will not get rid of the universal social charge. That is not just rhetoric but is borne out by the facts.",
                "The detail of all of this is never really discussed but it really is worth spelling out the truth of it. I heard the Minister say that what the Government has done in the budget is progressive but what is not progressive is how much workers earn and how much they pay in tax as against how much corporations earn and how much they pay in tax. The biggest tax head and the biggest source of revenue for the Government, representing 37% of all tax revenue, comes from workers. The total income of all workers in 2023 was €144 billion. They paid €24 billion in tax, which amounts to 16.6% tax on their income when all of the credits and so on are factored in. A total of 3.1 million workers earned €144 billion and paid €24 billion in tax. In contrast, corporations in the same year earned €317 billion but only paid €22 billion in tax, which represents 7.1% of their pre-tax income. Corporations have seen their income go through the roof. They earn vastly more pre-tax income than the 3.1 million workers in this country but they pay less in tax and, proportionately, they pay less than half of what workers pay on their income. That is the truth. Currently corporation tax receipts represent 27% of all tax paid. Workers pay 37% on substantially less income. That figure jumped hugely after the introduction of the USC. The proportion of revenue that was available to the Government from workers jumped. I find it laughable at budget time when finance Ministers and public expenditure Ministers say \"I am allocating this to you\", when what is actually happening is that they are giving workers back their own money. The money that the Government has was generated by the workers. The Government gives a little bit back to workers but it is giving most of it back in tax breaks to the big corporations that are paying, proportionately, less than half of what workers pay on a far lower amount of income.",
                "I have mentioned the corporations but there are also the individuals who might be subject to the wealth tax that we are proposing. Again, the figures are just mind-boggling. In the fourth quarter of 2023 the Central Bank's quarterly accounts showed that the net wealth of all Irish households was €1.1 trillion. That had increased by €33.2 billion in just the last quarter of 2023. That is an incredible amount of money. It is quite shocking to think there is that much wealth in the country when workers are crushed with the cost of living but helpfully, the Central Bank explains it. Just 10% of Irish households own 54% of that wealth. It is absolutely extraordinary that 10% of Irish households own 54% of €1.1 trillion. That is increasing exponentially, year on year, while the real value of workers' incomes is getting less because of the impact of the cost-of-living crisis and the fact that they continue to be crushed with taxes like the USC. Incredibly, there are now 1,400 individuals in this country with wealth of over €47 million and 20,000 individuals with wealth of over €4.7 million.",
                "There are 20,000 people with more than €4.5 million each in wealth and assets. That is extraordinary. Oxfam has made a simple suggestion that we have been proposing for years. I was happy to see others also proposing a wealth tax that would impose a very small tax on that wealth. It would be imposed on those with more than €4.7 million and would, therefore, affect only the 20,000 richest people in the country, who have a lot of money. The proposition is that there would be a 2% tax on the net wealth of people whose wealth is between €4.7 million and €50 million. There would be a tax of 3% on wealth between €50 million and €1 billion and a tax of 5% on wealth above €1 billion, which would apply to approximately ten individuals. Such people would probably generate 5% growth in that wealth in the course of a year. They would probably not even feel that tax but it would generate approximately €8 billion. We asked the Minister, Deputy Chambers, during the summer how much it would cost to get rid of the USC for everybody earning less than €100,000. The cost would be €2.5 billion. We could remove that brutal austerity tax and dramatically improve the financial situation of hundreds of thousands of workers in this country at the cost of €2.5 billion. We could apply a modest tax on the richest 20,000 multimillionaires in this country. They would not feel the effect of that tax and it would pay for the removal of the USC four times over. There would be money to burn if we did that and we could put that money into other things, such as housing, healthcare and so on. The Government, however, will not do it. Even now, the Commission on Taxation and Welfare and other middle-of-the-road economic think-tanks are saying we should seriously consider introducing wealth taxes. The Government still will not do it. The rich would not even feel it but the workers would feel it a lot. It would be just and fair to do it but the Government will not. It is criminal. It is robbery of the working people of this country who have generated a record budget surplus. We continue to siphon that money into the pockets of superwealthy corporations and the richest in Irish society.",
                "I am sure the Government will not respond in any way but at least we remain consistent in saying that the USC is unfair. It has been a gross imposition on working people. The Government should honour its commitment to get rid of it and should ask the very wealthy of this country, who have done extremely well, and the big corporations to pay a small bit of extra tax to give the working people of this country a bit of justice."

                "I will come back to the whole question of a wealth tax. It is an interesting question but it is a little more complex than Deputy Boyd Barrett thinks. The same applies to corporation tax.",
                "One thing I hate in any tax proposal is the situation where if a person moves above a certain figure, he or she goes back to square one and pays from there. As a modest proposal, how much would it cost to not charge any USC on the first €13,000 of earnings? At the moment, the tax applies when one earns €14,000. People tell me that nobody hits that, but pensioners, in particular, do. We must remember that social welfare income is not counted as income. If someone has a private income of €14,000 or €15,000, they are paying a little bit of USC and have to make a tax return and so on. That is particularly the case for the self-employed. Going back to the real world, how much would it cost to make that adjustment?",
                "There is a second measure I think would be sensible. I absolutely agree with the idea of a reduction from 4% to 3%. Allowing that anybody who has a medical card does not pay more than 2%, how much would it cost if the first €60,000 was taxed at 2%, as opposed to the situation at present? I do not particularly like using the medical card as a means test for schemes other than the medical card. The Minister and I know that when the Minister for Health proposes to extend eligibility for the means test, the Department of public expenditure starts looking at all the schemes that use the medical card as a shorthand for eligibility, as it does in this case. I am not suggesting anybody should go backwards. I am suggesting that the people who are not benefiting go forwards. On the other hand, we all know that in the real world in which some of us live and where we deal with people who have very modest incomes, it is an inhibitor for people who are afraid of losing their medical cards. This Government has given out a lot of GP cards, which is welcome, but they are no substitute in most people's minds for medical cards, if we are getting down to the brass tacks of the everyday realities of the people I deal with and have dealt with for the past 35 years. These are the issues that those people are raising. Will the Minister give an indication of the cost of both of those proposals? It would be useful.",
                "The Minister might also give us the gross figure for how much comes from the USC. When people say we should abolish taxes, I always say that is an attractive suggestion. When I was a Minister years ago, somebody suggested we abolish the VRT. I said I would prove that the VRT is a good tax. It is progressive when compared with many other taxes. We were at that time getting something in the region of €1 billion from VRT. My question was what we could replace it with. We cannot abolish taxes without replacing them with something else because otherwise we would be changing the arithmetic of the budget. As somebody who was here during the good times and the bad times before them, I remember that the people who had been telling us to spend and reduce taxes were the very ones who criticised us for being profligate when the money ran out. At that stage, we effectively had no public debt, unlike now where we have a very large public debt. We had large budget surpluses at the time, particularly when taking into account the value of money at the time compared with now. As I said, that quickly ran out with the double whammy of a reduction in taxes and an increase in costs, particularly welfare costs, hitting at the one time. It is awfully easy to move away from a surplus. If there is a gross surplus of €24 million, that is fine, but it is very easy to go from there to a deficit of twice that amount if you get that double whammy. We were hit by the reduction in taxes. People often think that capital taxation was the issue but it was not. PAYE, PRSI and VAT were the big reasons for the downturn in Exchequer funding at the time. The banks and the building crisis were obviously the cause of the downturn in the income.",
                "The issue of taxing corporations has been well debated. It seems that no matter how well we debate the issue, people blithely go forward as if we did not live in a bigger world. Some salaries paid to people in this country for services are, on an objective level, very high. However, I recognise that if you are in international competition, you have to pay the international rate. Deputy McGrath was talking about people emigrating but some people are emigrating to America or wherever else because the salaries are better.",
                "Many of these are in the health sector, which are paid for by the State. People go to Dubai teaching or nursing, and good luck to them. The reality is that if you want to pay salaries of that order, you have to keep coming up with the money. It is, therefore, not as simple as people make out.",
                "Going back to the corporations, I presume an analysis has been done by the Department of Finance as to the likely migration of some of the big corporations which are the big employers. We do not seem to have a conjoined debate on this. If the Government changed its corporation tax, what is the risk of flight of some of the big multinationals that are paying a totally disproportionate amount of corporation tax? What would the consequence of that be in terms of lost PAYE, PRSI and USC, which would follow? We would once again get into the whammy of losing our industry. It might not be an ideal world because we are not living in an ideal world. These corporations have enormous choice and power.",
                "Furthermore, it is not necessarily that they leave. I am told the risk is that the pipeline dries up. As the companies we have stop being the top companies, the new companies that replace them do not come in. If we go back to 40, 50 or 60 years ago, companies that were then world renowned became redundant because technology caught up with them. An example of this is in Rochester, New York, which I visited in 2019. It was explained to me that many thousands were employed there. One employer was Xerox. However, Xerox continued to make photocopiers and computers caught it out. The other was Kodak, the biggest photography company back when people used rolls of film and got them processed. Kodak persisted with its technology and nothing came to replace that company. The danger for us is that the pipeline of new, modern, replacement technologies would not come in here. In my lifetime I have seen lots of fine technologies disappear. Only for the fact that we had new companies coming in all the time we would have lost a great deal of our wealth had we not kept it really attractive for them to come in.",
                "As I said, it might not be an ideal world. In a world where everybody was generous and philanthropic in a massive way, and companies did not try to make money, it would be grand. However, in the real bad world out there, I would be interested to see the analysis that has been done on the movement.",
                "Similarly, in regard to the wealth tax, do we know of small countries similar to Ireland that have high levels of wealth tax? Do we have any data on what is being raised by a wealth tax and whether there was a flight of wealth undertaken by the most wealthy in those circumstances? If we are trying to hit the multibillionaires, I suspect their money would be fairly mobile and there would be a flight of finance. I would be interested in the Minister’s views on that. What analysis has been done as to why a wealth tax would have downsides that we have to think of carefully before finding ourselves in a net-zero game where we actually lose rather than gain money, by changing it, due to the mobility of wealth in the world?",
                "As I said, I am not lauding the fact that is the case. There is far too much wealth in too few hands. I believe in the old Fianna Fáil philosophy of a dispersed ownership of wealth. For example, I am a great believer in as many people as possible getting back to the 80% owning their own house and do on. I see challenges all the time in the very open economy that we have."

I was brought up by my father who taught me many things, thankfully. As many Members might know, I spent my days and nights with him from the day I started working until the day he departed in 2014. We milked the cows together, drove the machines together and went to meetings in the evenings together. We went everywhere together. One of the most important things he taught me was to keep my word. He said that if you have not got your word, you do not have much at all. No matter what you have in assets, if you do not have your word, you have nothing at all. Fianna Fáil at that time promised it would get rid of the USC charge when the country was out of trouble. We still have it. It is a punitive tax that affects everyone, especially now, when we hear Members saying that the country is awash with money.",

All of a sudden, Covid-19 came and there was money for all kinds of things. Then came the water scheme, there is money for everything. We see over €5 billion being spent on immigrants. We see there is no clue as to how much money is being spent on climate action. We see the ridiculous things that have been done, stopping us from cleaning our rivers, blocking drains that people slaved at to drain their land to make it more productive. We have a scenario now whereby they are narrowing the roads. We gave all our lives aspiring to widen roads to make them safer. Now, in places such as the Rock Road and up the Spa Road to Gneevgullia, they are narrowing the roads in order to slow down the traffic. They are highly dangerous now. No one travels the footpath or the cycleway on the Rock Road because they cannot get out of it nor get onto it. These are the ridiculous things-----"

                "It is quite ironic today to have speeches telling us it is not possible to increase corporation tax or to have a tax on wealth. The reason it is ironic today is that I got a push notification from The Irish Times to say that the first €3 billion tranche of Apple tax money has landed in State coffers. I remember being told something was impossible. Those of us who opposed the Apple tax deal, called it out and opposed the waste of public money on fighting a case to keep the money on the balance sheet of one of the richest corporations in the world were told, sure the money would never be yours anyway, all the other countries would try to take it and it would never end up being in the hands of the Irish State. What has happened? We are utterly vindicated. The first €3 billion has come and the rest will come. Do not believe it when people say alternative policies are not possible or workable; that is designed to constrain the terms of debate to say to people in the old Thatcher terms that there is no alternative. It is not true. There is an alternative to the USC; that is what our amendment is about. One alternative is a millionaire's tax on the wealth of the super-rich.",
                "Research by Oxfam found that the richest 1% own more than one third of Irish financial wealth. There are 11 billionaires in this country. Men like Eugene Murtagh, the founder of Kingspan whose company was found partly responsible for the Grenfell Tower disaster; Denis O'Brien, who bribed a Fine Gael Minister to secure the second mobile phone licence; and Dermot Desmond, who made payments to Charlie Haughey. All of them amassed their riches not off their own work but off the backs of workers and from corruption. All now have more money than they could ever spend. There are also more than 1,400 people in this country who have wealth of over €47 million; more than 20,000 have wealth of more than €4.7 million. Just by taxing this tiny elite, less than 1% of the population, Oxfam has shown how €8 billion could be raised every year. That is €3 billion more than the total amount raised from the USC last year. We could abolish the USC and still have €3 billion left over every year to fund public housing, free public childcare or a proper national health service. Every year, the Finance Bill is passed and Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Greens make a political choice not to tax the super-rich, who can well afford it. They choose instead to impose the burden of taxation on ordinary workers, who cannot.",
                "In the midst of a dire cost-of-living crisis, where so many families struggle literally to keep the lights and heat on and to put food on the table, we should not make millionaires and billionaires exempt from paying. We should make them pay, not take the money out of workers' pockets. There should be no billionaires. People do not have the right to have billions of euro of wealth. They do not deserve it. I do not believe they have earned the multiples they have compared with the average worker and the average amount of wealth. It should be taken from them and redistributed to those who need it. They are the only species on this planet who deserve to become extinct."

They are not looking for benefits. Often, they are not eligible for them. They are keen to hold on to a reasonable portion, and more, of their hard-earned pay. Economists might know them as the middle four deciles; whatever level we put on them, they are people with modest incomes who work and are keen to spend on their families and to hold onto their income. The USC is a big deal for many. The 1% change to 3% is helpful to these people. It is meaningful income at the end of the week and month. We would love for it to be more. I want to get a handle on how practical that is and what it would cost to give further space and would it not be wonderful to do away with it? What would be the euro value of doing away with the USC and how practical is it? It sounds popular but can we put euro values on it to define it?",

Tar éis seachtaine nó lá fada a chur díobh, tá an cháin tar éis an tuarastal sin a chreimeadh agus tá brú orthu. Mar sin, tá an USC an-tábhachtach dóibh.

I want to draw the attention of the Minister to couples who do not and are not fortunate enough, or choose not, to have children of their own. Their families want to pass on to those families part of what they have hard earned and paid tax on along the way. People inheriting in this case would not be able to avail of the group A tax band similar to the way in which a son or daughter can.

                "We can spend hours talking about this. USC, as I said at the outset, is a disingenuous, heinous and cruel tax that was brought in as a temporary arrangement after the crash. The coalition Government promised to abolish it. The Minister might shake his head and say that Fianna Fáil did not but they are one and the same now - totally hybrid. The Green Party members are hanging around there as well and they do not know what they are doing but Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are all the one and are more and more alike. How will they be able to go out, knock on doors and ask people to vote for them, where Fianna Fáil attacks Fine Gael and Fine Gael attacks Fianna Fáil? The old traditional way is imithe, gone. I know that the parties have enough spin doctors to do this for them but the real issue is this punitive charge on ordinary working people. It is punitive and regressive.",
                "I certainly will not take any lectures from An Teachta Ó Murchú about us standing up for ordinary people. We put our names before the electorate, the Healy-Raes and myself, and it is up to the electorate to decide, as it is in the case of Deputy Murphy. I know from social media that the Deputy is pleading with people to come out and help them as he is afraid he will be swamped up or removed and I do not know what panic he is in. If he is doing his work and is looking after the people, that should not bother him.",
                "I actually agree with Deputy Murphy 100% as regards the rich and the super-rich in that they should be taxed heavily. They are entrepreneurs and provide much good work and all but this has to stop somewhere. The gravy train has to stop but the problem is that Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil are beholden to these people, including the beef moguls and the big businesspeople. We have seen that time out of hand.",
                "They are grouped in with Deputy Murphy's support as are all of the NGOs. They are now like a field of daisies, there are so many of them in the field. If they can be where the cow has done her business, there would be dozens of them. There are 36,000 non-governmental organisations costing €6 billion a year. I question the validity of tens of thousands of them. There are some very good people there and certainly necessary NGOs but this has gone beyond. They are in front of, behind, beside, before and around the Government and they are just dictating its policy. It does not matter what legislation or the amendments the Members in this House try to bring in; they are there and they have such a grip around the handlebars of power because they have been allowed to do so by weak Ministers. That is very sad.",
                "I have no more to say on this amendment. We know that we will be putting this to a vote and we know that it will be voted down by people who are speaking here in support of it, which is the comical part of it."

                "I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. Listening to Deputy Mattie McGrath most recently and earlier this evening, he failed to acknowledge that this is a much more fragmented Dáil. There are many political parties and each political party will contest the election on its own platform. This outgoing Government is a government of three very distinct and unique individual parties that fought the last election on their own election manifestos and will fight this election on their own election manifestos. As the Minister, Deputy Chambers, quite rightly said, what the Government achieved in the reduction of the USC went over and above what the party had gone to the country with on the last occasion. I compliment the Minister for achieving that in the negotiations for this budget. If we are to take on board that we are all the same, as Deputy Mattie McGrath concluded, then all the Independent Deputies must be the same. He must be the same as the People Before Profit Deputies or whatever other Independents, including the Independent Alliance and Independent Ireland. They are all the same by Deputy McGrath's calculation but they are not.",
                "He wants to have his cake and to eat it, as he is a Deputy who likes to use old sayings in Dáil debates. I compliment the Minister for Finance on achieving the reduction in the universal social charge. We would certainly like to see us going further. Where I agree with Deputy McGrath is that as a Government, we have to continually strive to ensure that we incentivise and reward work. It is most important that the people who get up and go to work feel that they are getting a break and that they are supported and rewarded for what they do. We are very fortunate in this country today that we have full employment and that anybody who wants a job here does not have to go abroad to get work. They have the opportunity to work in this country and indeed many people are coming from abroad to work here because it is an attractive place to work. I, for one, will always speak up for and talk up the benefits of the country rather than talk down how good this country is doing like some of our colleagues. The fact that the Minister was able to secure a budget surplus means that we have the necessary resources now to tackle the issues out there. There are challenges but there are always challenges in society. How a government responds to those challenges is critically important.",
                "Listening to some Opposition Members, one might somehow believe that the cost-of-living measures introduced were somewhat wrong. If people take a very short look at some of their social media pages, they will see that they are all welcoming and advertising when the cost-of-living measures will be introduced and paid to the recipients. On the one hand, they are criticising us in here for what we are doing and, on the other, they are going on social media and advising people when these measures that this Government has introduced will become available to them.",
                "I will make one other point that I would like the Minister to clarify. I am not sure it is exactly relevant to this section but based on the fact that we may not get to the relevant section, I welcome the extension to the help to buy scheme. Going back to what previous speakers said, this is about rewarding people who work and giving those people the opportunity to claim their tax back so that they can buy their first home. This is about supporting people into home ownership. This is, again, another aspiration of our party. I welcome the fact that there is certainty in this regard out to 2029. On the help to buy scheme, I refer to the rigidity, sometimes, of how schemes are implemented by Revenue and on the loan-to-value criteria. Sometimes the initial loan to value that is submitted can be different from when the actual house is completed. Revenue still will not take on board an updated loan to value.",
                "Let us say somebody is starting out building a house and they have a desire to build it to a certain specification with a Rolls Royce finish. The garden, the landscaping, the garage and everything is done but for whatever reason they do not get to finish it off because they do not have the money to do so. Then the value of the property is less than what the projected value of it is. When they look to achieve their drawdown of the loan to value, they are told that it does not meet the criteria. That is wrong because the valuation on a completed property is much more realistic than a projected valuation on the property when the application is made on day one. The property may not have been finished to the standard people wanted. They may not have put in hardwood doors internally or may have opted for an IKEA kitchen over a handmade one because that is all they could afford. Then when they go back to avail of the help to buy scheme they are told the original valuation submitted must be stuck with. That needs to change. I raised it with the Minister's office with reference to two specific cases in my constituency and did so as well as with the Minister's predecessor. Both times there was an undertaking to review this or to explore if something could be done and I would certainly welcome something being done in this regard. I compliment Deputy Chambers on what he achieved in his short term as Minister for Finance."

                "I welcome the changes to the USC and the tax bands. Contrary to the opinion that the higher rate of tax kicks in too late for some, we have to recognise, as Deputy Ó Cuív mentioned, that we are in a constant competition for talent and if our taxes on jobs are too high, we will lose jobs. I have listened to debates here inside out and upside since 2011 on the tax policy of the three governments since then. The recognition that the approach has been right is shown in today's employment statistics, which show the guts of 800,000 jobs have been added since that year. This shows the last three governments have got tax policy on job creation and protecting jobs correct. It means in many sectors we use little carrots and sticks to encourage those with wealth to spend it here and invest it here, be it in research and development or other areas, to invest it in their business and put it back into their business. That is all with a view to job creation, not a view to making them richer, which is the picture painted here by an awful lot of people. They think that is what we are about; it is not. We are about generating an economy that can then be used to fuel the investment we need in housing, education, health and everywhere else it is called for day after day in this House.",
                "We sat here and had many discussions in 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 when we only had less than €1 billion to spend on housing and a request to spend more. Now we are spending €6 or €7 billion of taxpayers' money on housing, along with other money. Nobody in opposition ever asks what happened to bring us from €1 billion to €6 billion. It is because the country has been run right with the right policies to bring in the right amount of tax. None of us likes paying tax, be it income tax, USC or any of it. Deputy Boyd Barrett is right. I would have loved to have been able to get rid of the USC, but it is not realistic. It is realistic to try to cut it as the Minister has done again this year by taking another percentage point off it and in general get us back down there at the same time as protecting our public finances and ensuring we are investing them properly, which is what we are trying to do here. The key to that is job creation. Debate after debate here gives the impression it is all about trying to make those who create the jobs wealthier, but it is not about that. Many of those people take extra risk and it is when they have their business at a certain size and have created a certain amount of employment that we are trying to ask them to go further, take on more risk and expand into international markets. I see policies from other parties in opposition that also encourage the same thing. They are speaking out of two sides of their mouths because if they are asking those businesses to take that risk, there has to also be some reward.",
                "Most importantly, we have to ensure their employees are always encouraged to take on the extra work. We need the person to come in and do an extra shift at the weekend to maybe generate more ideas and to think in a quiet time of a new concept or something else in research in development. If we tax them too high, why would anybody with that expertise come in to do the extra couple of hours or the extra shift? Why would they if the government is going to put its hand in, take out 55% or 56% and put it in its pocket? The money would be well spent, but an individual will not be encouraged to put their brain to work for that extra time if too much of their money is taken away. That is why it is important the Minister is bringing the point where the higher rate of tax kicks in up. We must remember we are constantly competing for talent. There are many different incentives here. There are a lot of changes we will not even get to that are supporting SMEs, investment in SMEs, putting funds back in and rewarding that, as well as startups. It is about the right environment and we are making the changes bit by bit. I will always say that from an enterprise point of view we do not make them quick enough, but we are on the right path. Every year I see progressive changes here to the system that will create jobs. That is so important because too many people in here forget where we were back in 2011 when we were scrambling to find jobs and there was misery out there. That has completely changed.",
                "It is quoted that people are leaving the country and this, that and the other. Whenever you look at those articles and see the headline it always tells you how many thousand left the country and it is only when you go down into the article you will see how many came home. Generally, in the last couple of years, I am thankful it has been an equal number coming home. There are more coming in in total, but those coming home nearly always equal those who are leaving. Our job as legislators and as the people in charge of the public finances is to ensure people have the option to stay here and people have the option to come home. People did not have those options many times in the country’s history, but fortunately they have them now. Our job is to ensure that job is still there in three, five, 15 and 20 years. That is why all the decisions the Minister has led on in this budget, which were across the three parties, are about making sure those options and choices will still be there in five, 15 and 20 years. It is about putting resources in now to protect the public finances in future and by investing in infrastructure now for the long term.",
                "Of course, there are always going to be challenging times when it comes to housing. I have no doubt about that. There is no doubt we missed a couple of years where unfortunately we were unable to invest in housing, but fortunately we are on the right track now and people have the choice to come back home. There are numerous schemes there to avail of, but we have to stick at it and continue with it. When we have policies that work like the help to buy scheme, the home equity scheme and the various schemes we know are now working, that other parties are even considering changing them in a general election is a really unstable way to go with the country. After all the years of trying to make these changes, we are getting it right. How do we know we are getting it right? We see the activity in housing coming up to the level we want to get to. Again, I hear people quoting mad figures of going to 80,000 or 90,000 homes per year. That will bring us back to where we were before. There has to be a steady, progressive increase in supply every year to a level that is sustainable, and that needs to keep going for 20 or 30 years. That is really important. It is about the numbers at work and then a progressive tax system. Please do not tell me we do not have a progressive tax system. Every one of us can pick out a category of people and say one got €50 and another €150. It is the percentages you look at to see progressivity, as the Minister will say. To see a progressive tax policy it is the percentages you look at, not an individual sample of someone who got €20 and someone who got €50. It is the percentages and they are right. They were always progressive in the last number of budgets we have been responsible for."

It had nice posters, placards and photo opportunities about that, but it was not just Fine Gael. Fianna Fáil promised to abolish USC on the first €80,000 of income and Labour promised to abolish it on the first €72,000 of income in the run-up to the last general election.

I just wanted to put on the record that it was not just Fine Gael that made pledges in respect of USC.",
                "I am conscious that we are in the mouth of an election. I have listened to what other speakers have said. I agree with a lot of what Deputy Ó Cuív has said. He came close to endorsing some of Sinn Féin's policies because our proposal to abolish USC on the first €45,000 would benefit everybody. There would be no step effect. Medical cards would also be made available to those individuals under our proposals, which was the second issue the Deputy talked about when discussing that step effect.",
                "On the picture the Fine Gael Deputy has presented in the House today, there is no doubt but that the economy is doing well and that we have resources in abundance, particularly because of the Apple tax. I agree with Deputy Paul Murphy. We put down motion after motion on the Apple tax and the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, blatantly told us that, even if we got the money, we would not be able to keep it. Did he just make that up? Did he deliberately mislead the Dáil? Did he believe it at the time? Was he just embarrassed that the Commission had called him out on selective tax arrangements? It was not true. We see that is the case because nobody is even whispering it today. I agree with what Deputy Paul Murphy has said in that regard.",
                "Listening to the previous speaker, you would not think that more than 500,000 people are in poverty in this State. You would not believe that 170,000 children are in poverty in this State. You would not think that we had the highest levels of homelessness, including child homelessness, ever seen in this State. That is after 14 years of Fine Gael government. The Fine Gael TD rightly pointed out that, with regard to immigration, that people have to be given an option. I agree with him on that. That is exactly what I believe this election is going to be about. It is going to be about hope. However, we also need to cut through the bull and look at the facts. Home ownership for the under-40s has collapsed since Fine Gael went into government."

The Government will do something for people in one area but push house prices up by €100,000 on the other end. Before Deputy English came in, I made the point that institutional funds have bought 6,200 apartments in this State in the last year. That is four times more than what they were buying before this Government came into office."

It is because of housing. The Minister talked about figures, data and new measures. What party goes into a general election planning to fail on housing again?

They tell me about their daughter and her family, her partner and children, who are staying with them while trying to save because they cannot possibly save money while paying rent. Door after door, that is the story.",
                "Looking at the facts of what has been happening in housing, we see that there have been virtually no houses built in the Dublin city area during the term of this Government. No affordable housing scheme houses at all have been built in the Dublin city area in the lifetime of this Government. What is being built in high-rise apartments. That is what is covering my constituency as regards new developments. The same applies right across the Dublin city area. Even if people want to settle down, have a family and so on, these apartments are, in the main, highly unsuitable. Even if people want to buy, they cannot because more than 90% of those apartments have been bought by vulture funds. They are mainly build-to-rent, lower standard, smaller shoeboxes with no storage and no usable outdoor space. When this Government talks about all the units it is building, it is essentially talking about high-rise apartments. When people in their late 20s and 30s want to buy a home, settle down and start families of their own, they are not looking for built-to-rent apartments; they are looking for a home.",
                "Because no new homes are being built, there is great pressure on the second-hand market. Most houses that become available on the second-hand market in Dublin city now go for approximately €100,000 more than the asking price. That is completely and utterly out of reach for most households, even where you have two people in very good jobs. Most people in public sector jobs, such as nurses, teachers, gardaí, cannot afford to buy a house in Dublin. That is the reason people are emigrating. Some people do not seem to understand that. We are also in serious trouble in trying to recruit essential public service staff.",
                "They cannot afford to live in Dublin because there are no affordable houses in Dublin city and very few in County Dublin. That is the legacy left by this Government and there is no denying it. While there are new units everywhere, they are all high rise, build to rent and bought up by vulture funds. That is the reality of housing thanks to this Government. That is the reality of the kind of housing provided in the Dublin city area in the past four and a half years or longer.",
                "People sometimes ask why the Social Democrats did not enter government after the 2020 election or indeed the 2016 election. On both occasions, we had negotiations with Fine Gael on the possibility of entering government and, on both occasions, those negotiations broke down irreparably because Fine Gael continued to pursue failed housing policies. The proof of that is all around us ten years later. That is why people are emigrating. It is why young people feel they have been utterly let down by this Government and there is no hope for them in getting a decent start in their own country. These are people who did everything right. They got good leaving certificate results, went to college, got good jobs and still cannot set up a life for themselves in Dublin city. The implications of this for their parents are enormous in terms of pressures and overcrowding in the home and all of that. That is what we are finding. The Minister cannot be finding anything different on the doorsteps when he is canvassing in Dublin West because that is the story across Dublin. It is the appalling legacy the Government has left to young people in this country. It has failed them and they feel they have no hope in this country. They cannot foresee a future for themselves or have the same kinds of dreams and aspirations their parents had because the Government has prevented them from doing that. One of the key priorities and responsibilities of Government is to ensure an adequate supply of affordable housing for its citizens. The Government has utterly failed to do that.",
                "The other issue relates to tax. There has been a lot of debate today about the taxation system. When one looks at the budgetary policies pursued, they are the same as last year. It is giveaway stuff to try to buy people's votes. People are not fooled by that, however. They have said in successive opinion polls that they want investment in services rather than money being frittered away and, certainly, rather than receiving tax cuts. What we have seen in this budget and the previous one is that people receive once-off payments. In the main, it is people on lower incomes and on welfare who receive the once-off payments. It is people on higher incomes who get the very generous tax cuts, which, of course, are permanent benefits as opposed to the benefits for people on lower incomes. This is what is happening. While it is grand for people to get an extra few bob coming up to Christmas, and no one would turn that down, what happens after Christmas when the one-off payments are all gone and prices are still going up? That is why we in the Social Democrats have argued at every single budget that we should be spending any surplus or spare money on improving services rather than on regressive tax cuts. Unfortunately, this Government has taken a different approach.",
                "While we have a significant problem with low incomes in this country, people, whether they are on low or middle incomes, cannot afford to access childcare or timely healthcare. This is all in addition to not being able to afford to pay a mortgage or rent. They cannot afford the kinds of transport costs associated with living in a city either. This all adds up and makes living difficult for people.",
                "It is all very well for the Government to talk about implementing health reform but the reality is that, in many cases, even if someone qualifies for a medical card or a doctor visit card, it is still exceptionally difficult to see a doctor. That is due to the kinds of policies that have been pursued and the failure of the Government to introduce salaried GP posts, the implementation of which is overdue.",
                "In that regard, I will talk about a project in Dublin city, namely GP Care for All. The Minister is aware of it because I have raised it with him several times, as have others. Unfortunately, he has just brought down the shutters on it. He has not listened, which I am really surprised about, especially given that he is a GP and knows the difficulties with accessing GP care. I am sure he is familiar with the fact that, as the statistics from GP Care for All point out, in certain parts of Dublin it has been found that the medium age of death was 59 years versus a national figure in the early 80s. This is because people cannot access healthcare and the market-driven model pursued by this Government and previous Governments does not service areas of disadvantage particularly well. It is a reality, a rule in medicine, that the greater the need for healthcare in a particular area, the less likely it is that the area will get that healthcare. That is what happens with market-driven policies.",
                "GP Care for All, which is a charity, recognised this issue of the absence of adequate healthcare availability in areas of severe disadvantage. In this regard, it set up a charitable practice in Summerhill in 2016. As the Minister should know, this is an area of high disadvantage. It set up that practice and has been successfully providing primary care services to the most disadvantaged people in this country. The charity was in touch with me and some of the other representatives in Dublin North-West about providing the same service in the Finglas west area, which is another area ignored and neglected by the market-driven approach of this Government. There has been no GP operating in the entire Finglas west and south area for approximately 20 years. The Minister should know the implications of that for the health status and life expectancy of the people living in the area. GP Care for All was ready to set up a practice similar to the one in Summerhill in the Finglas west area. We were all very supportive of the proposal, which would have made an enormous difference to the health status and quality of life of the residents living there. We then learned - just a matter of months ago - that effectively the plug had been pulled on this important promised development. It was pulled because there was a change to the taxation system. Until January, the HSE was happy to regard contract income by GPs as a group income for a charity like GP Care for All. That is how it operated in Summerhill. There was a change made, however, in the taxation of income in partnerships, which has effectively excluded GP Care for All. It means the proposal for Finglas will not go ahead and the Summerhill service is now jeopardised. The likelihood is it will have to wind up by the end of the year. The Minister, by a stroke of a pen, could have tackled this issue to ensure the service in Summerhill continued and that the people of Finglas west and south received the kind of healthcare service they need and deserve. I am appealing to the Minister again. He has been appealed to by various Members, some ministerial colleagues and even the Ceann Comhairle who is very supportive of this charity. Despite this, he has failed to act.",
                "Dr. Austin O'Carroll, whom the Minister will know and who does extraordinary work, and his colleagues have been meeting in the Department of Health. That Department is very happy to see this kind of model supported; the difficulty is in Revenue and the Department of Finance.",
                "This is probably one of the last times I will speak in the Dáil. We have been working towards getting proper healthcare for people in Finglas west and south for a very long time. I am making a very strong appeal to the Minister, as I am sure other representatives for that area will do, to take on this issue and to introduce the very minor change that is required in order for this charity to continue its really important work. I ask the Minister to give consideration to that appeal and to make that move. It is a very small change he could make that would make an enormous difference to the lives and the health of so many people in this country. I ask him to revisit this issue as a matter of urgency."

I welcome aspects of the changes, in particular the €10 million limit, which will not now come into effect until 1 January 2025. I would suggest, however, that a small number of changes could be made that would significantly improve the operation of this scheme. I ask that the Minister give consideration to the deferral. It should be rolled over where there is a subsequent onward gift that would also qualify for deferral under this subsection. This transfer from the child to the grandchild should not trigger a tax liability. Second, the amount assessed and charged under subsection (4A)(d) should be limited to an amount calculated to the actual proceeds received on disposal. The example could be if the transferred assets were to be severely diminished or liquidated as part of an administration or forward sale. Third, and finally, the necessity to claim the full abatement after 12 years in a tax return is overly burdensome, does not necessarily serve a policy purpose and should be deleted.",
                "As I said, I welcome the changes as regards the €10 million; however, I have concerns that the clawback period of 12 years appears very long. Such a holding period would, I fear, impede the orderly development of the business. Also, it is significantly longer than the period in play for our neighbours in the UK, and there is a concern that it might force some family businesses to look at moving their ownership base from here to overseas. The kernel of the request is that the Minister look at that and, ideally, move from a 12-year period to a six-year period."

I will return to them in a moment but I want to speak to the point Deputy Shortall raised. Since she said it might be her last time speaking in the House, I also acknowledge her almost 32 years served in Dáil Éireann. I think I am correct in saying she is the longest serving female TD in the House. I do not know whether or not that makes her the mother of Dáil Éireann but I do know that Róisín would not welcome our giving her too much faint praise, so I will not do that.",
                "The benefit of having somebody serving so long in a constituency is that you remember all the promises that have been made by different agencies. The requirement for GPs in our area is incredibly important, particularly in the Finglas west and south area. We have a promise of a primary care centre, and that will have GPs located in it, but it is still a number of years off. We have a solution here for a practice but the tax elements of it are causing difficulty in it being implemented. The proposed solution may be put on the Minister's desk, but the reality is that this sits with the Department of Health and the legislation which limits the ability of the HSE to contract with anybody other than an individual with regard to the GP contract. That can be for a good reason, because we do not necessarily want for-profit conglomerate groups coming in, but we have to look at that legislation, the Department of Health has to look at that legislation, and the Department of Health and the HSE have to look at changing that to allow for not-for-profit operators.",
                "As I said, this is broader than the proposed tax changes, but there is a bizarre situation where we have an employee of a not-for-profit practice in this case who has a shared tax arrangement with their partner, and their partner with them receives the USC liability for that entire practice. I know that contractually that income is assigned to that person. In practice, however, that income does not arrive in that person's bank account; it is retained by the not-for-profit practice. I draw the Minister's attention to this again. He knows we have spoken about this, and I know he and the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, have spoken about it. I welcome news from GP Care for All that there have been some discussions on this and that there is a proposal for a way forward with regard to Summerhill. I suppose there is a caution there on the part of GP Care for All in that if this issue is not resolved for the Summerhill practice, it is unwilling to extend its current sphere of influence into the Finglas area. The thing I care about is providing more GP care services into the Finglas area.",
                "Within whatever remit is left, or whatever possibilities are left between the Department of Health and the Department of Finance, we have to come to a solution on this. The reality is that the HSE providing directly-employed GPs within a primary care centre is the solution. I will not drift too much off this, but the USC obligation for somebody working in a not-for-profit practice does not make sense logistically, even though technically the contractor arrangements are there. I ask the Minister to look at that issue.",
                "More broadly, on the changes in the budget, with regard to USC, in many ways the budget is about keeping ahead of or keeping track with inflation while not adding to inflationary impacts. Between the Finance Bill and the Social Welfare Bill, we have done that in terms of USC changes, changes to tax plans, changes to things like the renter's tax credit, even some of the changes around the home carer's tax credits and so on, so some of what this Bill does is keep everybody where they are. That is often what a budget does. A huge chunk of a budget is about keeping people where they are. Equally, however, we have to address inequalities and reforms. Particularly with regard to the home carer's tax credit, to which this section relates, in the next Dáil we have to look at the two areas of people with a disability who are working, or people with a disability who have a social welfare payment, and, equally, carers who are working or who have a partner working or those exclusively on a social welfare payment. We know that within those two areas, disability and caring, there is a broad level of needs. Also, it is a very broad spectrum in terms of income earning. I know from the many carers who come to my clinic, particularly women, which many of them are, whose partner might work, that they find it a huge injustice that their income is adjusted by means tests from social welfare. They regard it as income but, of course, it is a social welfare support. In the next Dáil, we can and should be more ambitious in that area. However, I welcome the changes to the home carer's tax credit in this section."

                "I know you are about to conclude this, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, but I was struck by Deputy McAuliffe's comment that the Bill keeps people where they are because that is exactly what is coming back from this budget - the sense of injustice. People know that, come next February and March, they will be in the very same position as they were before this. It certainly keeps them in their place, whether that be carers or young people looking for a house.",
                "I listened with interest to all the talk about the need for people to have jobs. We talked earlier about choices. The choice that people from County Mayo, particularly north Mayo and the Erris region, where I am from, have faced on finishing college has been between living with their parents or going abroad for a place to live. The latter is what so many have done. You have only to look at the football teams in rural Ireland to see how many young people have been forced to go. The young people are our brightest and best. They are desperately needed in the likes of Mayo University Hospital, where they would find employment if that hospital were to implement safe staffing levels. The hospital has more than 80 positions vacant. We do not have the speech and language therapists or occupational therapists required, nor do we have staff across so many other disciplines. Young, educated people are forced to leave the country because they simply do not have a place to live. It is certainly a matter of keeping people where they are.",
                "I am struck by the lack of awareness of what meeting the cost of living is like for people. If they get an extra payment, it is gone within minutes on paying arrears on energy bills, making mortgage repayments and paying high rent. Twice as much is taken out of one pocket as is put into another.",
                "The sensible way to deal with taxation is, as Deputy Doherty said, to abolish the USC for people earning under €45,000 per year. That would have been the fair way to proceed. People would have more money in their pockets.",
                "I heard the Deputy who said what their party would do in the next Government. I would not presume the Irish people will put back into government the same people who put them into their current position and told them they will remain in it. The implication is that the current Government has had only 13 years and needs another five, or a total of 18 years. It is absolutely ludicrous that the Government would deny, even at this late stage, what it has failed to do in the budget. It has no excuses this time; the excuses have run out.",
                "We talked earlier about the Apple tax, which the Government spent €10 million trying not to get back. Its members are now falling over themselves promising what they will do with the tax, which was rightfully the Irish people’s tax in the first place. People can see through what is being done here. They can see through the short-termism of the budget and the absolute lack of vision regarding what we are considering this evening. The nation will not be bought by short-term gimmicks. I really would call them gimmicks. IFAC referred last year to the gimmickry going on in the economic sphere. There are certainly gimmicks in the budget but the Irish people will not be fooled by them."

                "I acknowledge everyone who has spoken. There was a wide array of topics referred to and I will try to respond on some of them. On amendments numbers 2, 3 and 4, on the universal social charge, the Rural Independent Group has requested a report on the abolition of the charge for those earning less than €70,000 per annum and a report on abolishing the charge for all employees in the State. Deputy Boyd Barrett has requested a report on abolishing the USC and replacing it with a wealth tax. Deputies Doherty and Conway-Walsh have requested a report on removing the USC from the first €45,000 a person earns.",
                "For 2025, it is estimated that the USC will yield in the region of €5.6 billion. With regard to the proposal to abolish the USC for all those earning less than €70,000, I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that it is estimated that this would cost in the region of €1.3 billion in the first year and €1.5 billion in a full year. It is estimated that 33% of all taxpayer units will not be liable to USC in 2025. Increasing the entry threshold to €70,000 per annum would exempt around 3 million or 86% of taxpayer units from the USC. The second proposal by the Rural Independent Group relates to abolishing the USC in its entirety. This was also proposed by Deputy Boyd Barrett.",
                "With regard to Deputy Boyd Barrett’s proposal to introduce a wealth tax to offset the Exchequer shortfall, taxes on wealth are already in place. Various taxes operate, in effect, as wealth taxes in Ireland, and these include the local property tax, capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax, as well as certain forms of stamp duty. The total net receipts for these various forms of tax came to just under €4.2 billion in 2023.",
                "The 2022 report from the Commission on Taxation and Welfare has found that a new tax on net wealth, if desired, should not be introduced without attempting to substantially amend Ireland’s existing taxes on capital and wealth. Rather than introducing a specific tax on wealth, the commission noted it would be more effective to re-examine the primary existing forms of wealth tax, such as capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax.",
                "On the proposal of Deputies Doherty and Conway-Walsh, which is to remove the USC on the first €45,000 a person earns, I am advised it would be at an estimated cost of €1.56 billion in the first year and €1.8 billion on a full-year basis. It would mean that approximately 2.49 million or 71% of tax units would not be liable to the USC.",
                "More broadly, Ireland has one of the most progressive personal income tax systems, which plays a crucial role in the process of income redistribution. A redistributive tax system has been acknowledged by the IMF, the OECD and, indeed, the ESRI. The budget package we introduced is built around three key pillars: changes to tax credits, the standard rate band, and the USC. The Government has sought to use each of these levers to spread the benefit of the package as effectively as possible. Following the discussion on the USC amendments, the section on the income tax package has an estimated cost of €1.1 billion in 2025 and approximately €1.3 billion in a full year. For 2025, the main tax credits would be increased by €125, which represents a 6.7% rise. The personal tax credit will increase to €2,000 in the case of single persons and to €4,000 for married people and civil partners who are jointly assessed for tax. The value of both the employee tax credit and the earned income tax credit will also increase, by €125 from €1,875 to €2,000.",
                "It is important to note that approximately 76,600 taxpayer units will be removed from the income tax net. These changes ensure many low-income earners will continue to remain outside the income tax net as incomes rise. A single person earning €20,000 or less in 2025 will now be outside the income tax net.",
                "I could go on about this but I just want to come back to some of the other points made by Deputies. Deputy Ó Cuív, who has just left the Chamber, referred to a variety of revenue costings concerning individuals who hold a medical card. I will revert to him on this.",
                "Some have raised the effective tax rates across our economy, as have been set out. According to the latest figures, from 2022, the top 10% of companies paid 12%. Deputy Boyd Barrett and Murphy raised this and I can send them the information.",
                "Under pillar 2, a minimum effective tax rate of 15% has been in force for turnover over €750 million for accounting periods commencing on 31 December 2023, and this reflects the changes in the international taxation landscape. The OECD agreement, when implemented, is such that there is a risk of a net cost to the Exchequer in terms of reduced tax receipts in time. We believe, however, that our involvement is a price worth paying to provide stability and predictability regarding Ireland’s role in the international tax framework. The estimated cost of joining both pillars has previously been published. Ireland has a small, open economy connected to the rest of the EU and, indeed, many other global trading partners, and that is why we have to maintain a competitive position when it comes to personal and corporate tax. What makes us attractive is not just our tax rate. We are also English-speaking, we provide access to the EU market, we have a young, educated workforce, and we have a common law jurisdiction, all of which continue to attract foreign direct investment.",
                "Much has been said about Ireland’s corporate tax regime in recent years. However, a few of the facts are often left out of the discussion. Ireland’s corporate tax policy and broader industrial policy have been consistently focused on attracting real and substantial investment, creating jobs and promoting prosperity. Our corporation tax regime has been an important part of our offering to indigenous businesses and foreign direct investors and it cannot be taken for granted.",
                "As I said, the strengths we are admired for cannot be taken for granted, in terms of the talent of our workforce, the quality of our education system and how it connects with industry, our stable political system and the wider predictability around tax policy, which are central to ensuring we continue to run budgetary surpluses. This way, we can continue to invest in our economy and support the more than 2.7 million workers working in the economy and recognise the important value of our current tax policy. Our workforce is central to driving that.",
                "I addressed some of Deputy Boyd Barrett's points around the wealth tax. If the Deputy looks at what the Commission on Taxation and Welfare has set out, he will see that there are options regarding existing capital taxes. We must, however, maintain a competitive position when it comes to corporate tax and the other capital taxes in our economy.",
                "Deputy Aindrias Moynihan raised a number of issues, some of which related to USC. He also raised the issue of inheritance tax with regard to a couple who do not have children but wish to leave their property to their niece or nephew and the exemptions or reliefs available to them. The relief is there and we have made an adjustment to the thresholds around these reliefs in categories A, B and C in the budget. It is also worth noting that there is an exemption from CAT where dwelling houses are bequeathed by individuals who have lived there for a specified period of time before the inheritance, who will continue to live there for a specified period of time after the inheritance and those who have no beneficial interest in any other residential property on the date of the inheritance.",
                "Deputy Troy raised specific queries relating to the help to buy scheme. I will revert to him directly on that. I know he has submitted parliamentary questions to me on this in the context of the existing legislation. Others have raised the issues of housing supply and the decision the Government made around increasing and revising our housing targets. If we look at where we have come from over the past four years, a number of years ago, more than 20,000 homes were being built per annum. That figure is now heading towards 40,000, which is above our Housing for All targets for 2024. We have set out ambitious and deliverable targets for the next number of years to make sure we deliver affordability, hope and a greater housing supply in our economy for many young workers who want to buy and own their own home.",
                "Many Opposition politicians would abolish many of the schemes that help people, including the help to buy and first home schemes. We have set out for the Minister for housing, Deputy O'Brien, a revised target of 41,000 new homes in 2025 with a trajectory to 2030. It is an ambitious and incredible pathway to support increased housing supply in our economy. The national planning framework will underpin that. It will be an issue when we set out our stall in the coming days during the general election campaign.",
                "Deputies McAuliffe and Shortall raised an issue they have raised with me previously. I will set out some of the detail as regards GP Care for All. I am familiar with Dr. O'Carroll who has been a fantastic GP in his community and a wonderful advocate for healthcare for people in Dublin and a leader in healthcare in the country. A particular practice model has been highlighted whereby incorporated charities such as GP Care for All operate a medical practice while employing GPs to provide clinical services. In such models, it appears the employee GP's income under GMS contracts has, to date, been incorrectly treated as the income of a medical practice in which the individual GP is an employee rather than income of that individual GP. It also appears the HSE made the GMS payments into the bank account nominated by the relevant GP, which is an account for medical practice rather than an account of the GP. This has led to a perception by such medical practices that the HSE, by making payments to the nominated bank account, is approving the reassignments of earnings in some way. The Department of Health has confirmed that this does not change the legal position, which remains that the individual GP is the person being contracted and is therefore paid for the GMS contract, regardless of who owns the bank account in which the GP has nominated to receive the GMS income. As such, that individual GP has always been and remains the chargeable person as regards taxation of income arising under the contract.",
                "Section 1008A is being perceived as a change to the legal position for all GP practices. That is not the case. The provision did not change the underlying legal position that the individual GP is the chargeable person as regards income arising under the GMS contract. Revenue issued guidance notes during 2023 clarifying the correct tax treatment of GMS income under tax legislation. Although the guidance was widely reported as a proposed tax change, it does not introduce a change to the tax treatment of GPs. Instead, it simply clarifies the existing legal and administrative position.",
                "When section 1008A was introduced in the Finance (No. 2) Act 2023, it was noted it was expected to resolve some, but not all, of the issues arising from contractual arrangements. This is because there are a number of business arrangements and models in the GP sector, including partnerships, companies, employees and employers. It was further noted, therefore, that the Department of Health had agreed to this approach and had confirmed that the strategic review of general practice, which is currently under way, would examine the relevant HSE contracts and propose measures necessary to modernise them. Although I am conscious of the difficulties being experienced by GP practices, it is important to set out the wider legislative context and the fact that there was not a change here. I have also been engaging with my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, on the matter.",
                "On the specific issue relating to GP Care for All, which is an important service in the community it serves, I understand the Department of Health and the HSE have met representatives of GP Care for All on four separate occasions in an effort to find a solution to the issue. I am informed that it was made clear during the early engagements that the Department and the HSE value the work of GP Care for All and their focus was ensuring the continued delivery of services. That engagement is ongoing between the parties and is focused on a model of funding or an operating structure that would allow GP Care for All to deliver its services on a sustainable footing. I understand that is the current position."

If any ordinary businessperson operated that way, they would not be in business. I mean no disrespect to the Minister in saying that. The problem with the Government, as I see it, is that there is not one businessperson in the Cabinet or among the junior Ministers. As I said earlier, the Government has the same advisers, which are the big names that are wheeled out all the time. No matter what it is, whether it is investigating RTÉ or looking into reports, it is the same people, the same consultants on the same gravy train. They are the same people who advise the Minister, his predecessors and the Government. He is new in the role.",

I do not have the acronyms of the new schemes but the Minister knows what I am talking about. All businesspeople, but especially those with small businesses, are hard pressed and very busy. Small businesses do not have staff to deal with the Government's schemes, meet deadlines and answer trick-and-a-loop questions where if they miss out by an hour, they are out.",

As I said, there is absolutely no difference now between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.",

                "It is a punitive tax. I hate quoting the dead former Taoiseach, Albert Reynolds, God rest him, who said this tax was a temporary little arrangement. That was the expectation. People put their shoulders to the wheel, as unpalatable as it was, because the IMF was dictating policy here. It came in and people paid it. Our amendment wants to remove people earning up to €45,000 and have a report and critical analysis done as to the impacts and come back with the results of the painful amounts of money the people paid. Our request was to have an examination of the pressure it is putting on people and the lack of spending power they had in other areas because of this tax. If they had that in their pockets and were able to spend it, they might feel valued and that their work paid, that it pays to work and that it must be rewarding to go to work. They would spend that in the economy. Of course they would. This Government has thrown many small businesses to the wind and to the wolves and they are closing. I heard a report this morning on \"Morning Ireland\" that a shocking number of businesses have closed this year. Why can the Government not see it? They would be able to spend that money in those small businesses, whether they be cafes, restaurants, public houses, beauticians, hairdressers, barbers or you name it. They spend the money and it goes around, not into Government coffers, where it is wasted on the shocking gravy train of waste. I could go through a litany of them here with the children's hospital as the most disgraceful of all.",

They have been talking about them for decades and the cost of anything the Government does is unbelievable. To think that Department of integration officials and the OPW could sit down in a room with me and tell me that modular cabins would cost €200,000 in a site provided by the HSE in Clonmel and would not cost any more. We now find out, four or five months later, that they will cost €446,000. I pointed out at the time that €200,000 was an outrageous amount of money. They are hardly worth €70,000. The waste goes on and on. The Taoiseach talks about €26 billion now in the HSE, up from whatever. Up and up it goes, and they have all these staff. How many of those staff are front-line doctors and nurses? What about the people waiting for orthodontic treatment and waiting for assessment for autism? What about Cara Darmody from Ardfinnan, County Tipperary, who is up here campaigning? I am sure that young girl will be here again tomorrow. What about all the different groups here daily begging and pleading, not for special treatment but for fairness? No, the special treatment is for the REITs and big businesses.",

They have married, settled down and are having children and grandchildren abroad. That is the reality because they cannot afford to get a house. They cannot afford to buy a house. They cannot afford to put a deposit together. In the country, where they have the wherewithal and can get a mortgage, they cannot get planning permission because of Government policies and what the Greens have done. The Greens have the tail wagging the dog that you lay down on every single policy. These kinds of sops and once-off payments and double payments are gone like snow off a ditch the day after. The bleak period in January will come after Christmas and people will be under twice the pressure. Who comes in then? The moneylenders. The Government has no interest in fairness. Fianna Fáil used to be the party of the little people like the ordinary PAYE workers, small business and small farmers but it has abandoned that completely to big business, the moguls, the beef barons and you name it. That is who Fianna Fáil now protects. Our earlier amendment was to stop the vulture funds but no, it could not do that.",
                "I refer to what the Government is allowing in respect of four in every ten homes built. Goodness knows the difficulty in getting them built, given the costs and not having enough tradesmen. We do have not enough skilled people and we have not the wherewithal to build the houses and reach the targets promised by the Government, which it keeps on breaking. It keeps on making more targets as announced again today. It will break them again. It has no sense of shame whatsoever. It could tackle that as well. There was a fight before the budget when kites were flown by one of the Ministers of State - I think it was Deputy Richmond - that stamp duty was going to be put up to 20% for those people buying four in every ten new homes built in this city and every other city. For me, that is 40% of them. Lots of young people who are saving and living in apartments and flats paying massive rents could have some chance of competing there, but no, these people are coming in. Did the Government increase the stamp duty to 20%? It went to 15% and it deserves a clap on the back. The Rural Independent Group and I wanted 50%, because these people should not be allowed to buy our homes. These are companies from Canada and America. We had a proposal in our pre-budget submission that unless they are from Ireland, are providing employment or have good reason to be here, then they could not be allowed to buy up these houses. Try to house our own Irish.",

I never saw anything like it. I took a photograph. I eventually went and hunted the seagull. It was pulling it away and he was trying to pull it back. My goodness. That is a real vulture, and they are the kinds of vulture this Government allows; the grey crows that destroy the lambs. How does the Minister sleep in his bed at night thinking of the ordinary people, and throwing sops here and there? He talks about the working men who go to work in the morning and they are pilloried. They do not get anything. They do not get the SUSI grants, the medical cards, the GP cards or the back-to-school allowance. They get nothing and they are pilloried and crucified. They do not get the double payments or the bonuses. Why should they not get them? They are the people who pay the taxes to pay all of our wages, mine included. No, the Government decides to support people who in some cases do not want to work. There are many people who are not able to work and I understand that totally. The Government talks about full employment and throws out this money just to buy the election. It is nothing short of it.",

They cannot separate the hybrid or cut the tandem in half now to go out to the people again. They have lost their identities and morphed into one. They are serving the European economic masters of Brussels and the World Economic Forum. People ask me how they can stay there and do that and sit back and pass it off. They are not serving the Constitution that elected them to this House. They are not serving the Irish people. They are not serving under the oath of office they have to serve and look after our people. They are more interested in prancing around the world stage and being the good boys in Europe and for big multinational conglomerates. That is who they want to serve now and they have lost their identity completely from the days of the founding members like Lemass and others. They have lost it completely.",

I know a gimmick when I see a gimmick. If it walks like a duck, it is a duck. It is quack-quack here, quack-quack there and quack-quack everywhere with the Government. Hopefully when they meet the geese and the ducks, they will meet a few ganders as well and they might put manners on them if nobody else will, because they are well able to.

He was called Jeremy Hallahan. He said he used to work in the woods felling timber and taking it out with horses in awful conditions on high ground that could not be traversed by anything else. He told me only fools and horses were working now and as most of the horses were nearly dead, that would leave the fools. That is how people feel. They are not being rewarded, respected or supported. They are not getting any fair crack of the whip at all - although they get up early in the morning and go to work - none. What happens if the Government disincentivises people from working? They do not work. Then you have situations where the second and third generations are not working. It is an unequal and unfair situation.",

The Minister, however, will not touch them under any circumstances. I would say that under threat of death the Minister would not tax them, whatever hold they have over the Government. It is a sad country. We fought so dearly to get our freedom here and now the Government is beholden to all these people, such as the World Economic Forum and our European masters.

Mar fhocal scoir, I remind the Minister why the USC is here. It is because of the bailout when the Government let off major investments and people in here who had insurance bonds. I had many an argument with the late Brian Lenihan over this."

                "This is what happens when a Finance Bill is guillotined. We end up with a shambolic Committee Stage where there is no actual scrutiny of the Bill and everyone is forced to try to shoehorn in any points they want to make into the first grouping of amendments. That is what has happened today. People have no choice at this stage. There is very little time left. They want to raise issues and had there been proper scrutiny of the Bill, we would not have this. Certain people who spent a lot of time talking would not even have gone down to a committee meeting because it is not the Dáil Chamber, not in front of the cameras really, so they would not have bothered. We all know who would and would not have been there to do proper scrutiny of the Bill.",
                "Anyway, we are where we are. There is very little time left. As a mover of an amendment in this grouping, I have made the main arguments. The argument we are making is that the USC was supposed to be an emergency, temporary tax, which was always unfair because workers paid the bill for the crimes of bankers and developers. It was never fair but that is why it was introduced. Workers picked up the bill for the crimes of others. As bad as that was, it was supposed to be temporary. The promises to get rid of it and that it would only be temporary have been reneged upon and workers are still having this imposed on them. Now we are told it is unrealistic to get rid of it. How can it be unrealistic to get rid of something that the Government itself stated it would get rid of? Pretty much anyone who is being in any way objective would say it was unfair in the first place and resulted only from the fact that there was a financial crash that was generated by the banks and developers and the politicians who allowed them to run riot in the housing sector.",
                "By the way, talking about the current housing crisis, it would not exist were it not for all the crimes that were committed back then and the politicians who facilitated them. The workers paid the bill via the USC and the working people of this country paid the bill with the housing crisis that persists. It gets worse every day and there is no sign anywhere on the horizon that it will be fixed any time soon. That is the consequence. It seems to me that a Government with a record surplus kind of owes it to the working people to make up for all the pain they had to take and to try to resolve those problems and address that inequity. The people who caused the crash and the housing crisis are making profits again. The banks are back making big profits. The property developers, many of the well-known names can be seen plastered around Dublin on building sites, are back making big money again on massively overpriced property that no ordinary person can afford. Would it not be fair for them to pay tax on their excess wealth in excess of €4.7 million? That is the proposal for the wealth tax we and groups such as Oxfam have put forward. The 20,000 people who have more than €4.7 million in personal wealth would pay a little tax on that and that would pay to get rid of the USC for workers who earn less than €100,000. It seems fair and entirely realistic to do that.",
                "Do not tell me - this is the Government's argument - that they would run for the hills as they would lack incentives. Where are the incentives for the nurses, teachers, the ushers and service officers in here or the tens of thousands of public servants or retail workers in this country? I was looking at the figures from the CSO on average earnings in different sectors of the economy. For those who work in food or retail, average earnings are €10,000 per year. For those who work in the arts, average earnings are €16,000 per year. Hundreds of thousands of working people are living in poverty. We proposed a refundable tax credit for those 20% of workers who earn less than €18,750 per year because they do not benefit from tax credits. We said they should have a refundable tax credit. That could also be paid for with a little bit of wealth tax, to actually help the working poor, of whom there are hundreds of thousands. It is not unrealistic to say we could do that. Do what we promised: get rid of the USC, be fair to workers who had that imposed on them and ask the multimillionaires to pay a little extra tax so that working people can get some reward for the work they do.",
                "In the short time available, I will mention another amendment we will not get to, as others have done. It relates to the film tax credit. As we speak today, there are film workers before the Labour Court, some of whom have worked 25 years, some 30, some 35 and some 40 years in the film industry. It is as though it never happened, however, apart from the fact that their names are on the credits of the films for all of those years.",
                "It did happen. They did work on those films and the Government subsidised the production of the films through section 481 and its predecessor, section 35. The film workers, who are in the Labour Court at the moment fighting for the recognition of their service to the industry over all those decades, estimate that since 1984, when the first of these film tax credits was brought in, about €4.5 billion has gone to the film producers. These credits go to the companies of the film producers. In Ireland, a handful of film companies dominate. The big names include Metropolitan Films, World 2000 Entertainment Limited, Element Pictures and so on. They are the biggest recipients and beneficiaries of the section 481 film tax credit, which is now running at about €100 million a year.",
                "Does the Minister know what the shocking thing is? Let us take Metropolitan Films as an example, but Element Pictures is the same. When the workers who have worked for them on successive productions for decades go into the Workplace Relations Commission or the Labour Court and say they have worked on five, ten, 15 or 20 films that were made by Metropolitan Films and they have been unfairly blacklisted and dismissed from the industry, Metropolitan Films or Element Pictures says it is not the workers' employer. The designated activity company, DAC, which was set up for that film production is their employer. Metropolitan Films accepts that it set up the DAC, but that is different. The State gives the film producer - Metropolitan, Element or whatever it might be - the money. The film producer sets up a DAC for the film and then disassociates itself from the DAC and says it does not employ anybody. The consequence is that people who have spent 20, 30 or 40 years in the industry have no recognition of service whatsoever because they are employed by these DACs, even though they are associated companies wholly owned by the company the Minister gives the money to.",
                "Under any objective view of company law and the relationship between companies, subsidiaries and so on, these DACs are subsidiaries of the companies the Minister gives the money to, and he gives the money to them specifically for the provision of quality employment, what is called the industry development test. In fact, the European Union only allows the Minister to give money to the film producers under state aid rules on the basis that he will create an industry and provide quality employment and training, but the people he gives it to say they do not have any employees. He gives it to them to create employment and then when the employees say the producers are their employer, they say they do not have employees. It is as if they never existed in the industry.",
                "There is no industry, but €4.5 billion has gone to these film companies since 1984. Workers, therefore, are totally vulnerable. They can basically be blacklisted out of the industry if they say boo on a film set or if they say they do not want to work dangerously excessive hours or assert their right under the fixed-term workers Act to carry their service from one film production to another. If they do that, they will be blacklisted and then when they go to the Labour Court about their blacklisting, they will be told the production company is not their employer and, in fact, nobody knows who their employer is or that it is a DAC that briefly existed and then disappeared.",
                "That is outrageous and this Government has allowed it to happen. Successive governments have allowed it to happen. I do not know how many times I have spoken about this to various Ministers for Finance and it just carries on and on. There is simply no protection for the workers. There is a very simple solution to this issue, which was proposed by the Committee on Budgetary Oversight. It is that the Minister would set down as a precondition of giving the money to the film producers that they acknowledge the service of workers who have worked across different DACs as their employees if they were set up by the same producer company. It is simple. If the Minister does not do that, the fixed-term workers Act means nothing and the workers have absolutely no rights, no recognition of service and might as well not have existed. As they put it, the clock goes back to zero in terms of their employment record at the end of every film production. It is as if they never worked before in the industry, even though they have worked in it for decades. That leaves them totally vulnerable.",
                "The other group demanding reform by the Minister of section 481 includes the actors, performers, writers and directors, that is, the people who actually do the performance or create the performance with their writing or direction. They have repeatedly said to the Minister, or his predecessors, that they are not getting fair and reasonable remuneration for their performances because they are forced to sign buyout contracts where the downstream revenues those films generate accrue to the producers, even though their performances, under copyright directives and legislation, should mean they benefit from downstream revenues. In other words, they should not just be given a once-off payment and forced to sign away their rights to the downstream revenues of a film if it does well. In that sense, films are unusual because it is not just a case of getting paid for the work on the day. If a film is very successful, as some Irish films are, they then potentially generate revenue for years. At the moment, workers are being told they will not get on a film unless they sign a buyout contract where they have to waive their right to the downstream revenues and if they dare to question that, they will not get on the film. That is it. That is a breach of their rights under the copyright legislation. It also states in EU directives that buyout contracts are supposed to be the exception, not the rule. In Ireland, they are the rule.",
                "That also means Irish actors, writers and performers are on lesser contracts than, for example, their UK counterparts under the PACT Equity agreement. They have asked repeatedly that the Government insist that film producers use the PACT Equity agreement used in Britain as the blueprint for the contract for writers, actors, performers and others on film productions. The Minister can crack that whip because he gives them the money. It should be very simple. He can just say they are not getting the money unless they recognise the service of the crew, give them their rights and ensure that writers, actors, performers and directors will benefit from the downstream revenues of their performances or their creative contribution to those film productions.",
                "I remind the Minister of what I said earlier. Most artists, writers, directors and performers live in poverty. Most people who work in arts in this country live in poverty, not the film producers, but the people who do most of the work. I appeal to the Minister to make those changes to section 481, which I have asked for many times. More importantly, the people who work in the film industry and the writers and directors have asked repeatedly that those changes be made. The workers will end up in court because, again, Metropolitan Films said today that it is not their employer, even though it set up the company that employed them or that it says employed them, but actually it was Metropolitan saying it is not their employer. The company knows them well. They have worked on all its film productions. It is laughable, shocking and disgraceful, but it goes on. I will leave it at that. I know other Members wish to contribute."

It is a terrible situation that we have been forced into. There has been quite a lot of discussion about the USC, which is a very unfair tax on the people out there. The Minister will say tax is needed but there are so many taxes out there today. It is hitting the ordinary, low-paid workers who see that charge being taken out of their pay packet every week, a charge that the Government and others promised to abolish but the Government has just added to people's misery by leaving it there. Low-income workers feel the pinch and the Minister had an opportunity in this budget to turn that around by exempting many of them from the charge but unfortunately, he did not see fit to do so.",

He should not shy away from the real people who are in dire situations. They are paying for energy, rates, staff, water and food. Cafés are closing down one after another and the Minister has stood idly by and allowed it to happen. It is happening all over Ireland but in particular, in my own constituency in west Cork. Numerous cafés and businesses have closed. The VAT9 group put forward some very good, strong recommendations but the Minister failed to take them on board. He has left small businesses, including cafés, restaurants, hairdressers, pubs and others in a dire situation.",
                "Accountability is important. It is okay to say that the universal social charge is there and that we need that money to pay for lots of things but there is no accountability regarding where the money is going in this country. People are crying out for accountability. They see €9 million for phone pouches, a children's hospital where millions and millions of euro have been spent and the budget has been overrun, the bike shed here and different things that are a cause of great concern. They want to know where their money is going. This country has money and there is no point in saying otherwise but where it is spent is the issue. There are issues like wastewater. Uisce Éireann has got an extra €1 billion but where is that money going to go? I got a report from the Minister recently, which told me that wastewater projects in Shannon Vale in Clonakilty, Rosscarbery, Dunmanway, Ballydehob or Goleen will have to wait. They do not even know if they will be in the 2025 to 2029 plan. That means there is no plan because if there was one, they would know about it straight away. Every time we meet Uisce Éireann we are told it does not know if these projects will be in the plan. Imagine swimming around in wastewater. It is inhumane. There is money available. The country is awash with money but there is absolutely no accountability.",

These are people who are working hard and who are looking after loved ones, neighbours or friends but for one reason or another - maybe some small bit of an extra payment at home if their partner is working - they are blocked from getting the allowance. That is a very unfair situation that the Minister should have considered especially when the country, as so many have said, has lots of money. Why has the money not gone to people like that who are hurting hard? The Government has taxes like the USC but also the carbon tax and motor tax, which hit those in rural communities, including farmers, very badly. There are difficulties being heaped onto fishermen. When there was a fuel rebate available for fishermen, the Government would not even apply for it and bring it into them to give them an opportunity. All in all, the Minister has a lot of money but an awful lot of money is being wasted in this country, as far as I am concerned. One thing that we will be going after very strongly is accountability for where the money is being spent. People should at least know where their hard-earned taxes are going. This country is taxing people into the ground."

                "In relation to spending money, taxes and USC, we have said previously that it is very important that people realise that when their money is being spent, it is being wasted. When the Government talks about housing - and it surely has done a lot of talking about housing - there is one avenue that it has not explored. We all know that there are so many vacant houses around the country, right under our noses. Each and every one of us knows that. The Government could utilise them if it allowed the same discretion to Irish people. What I mean by that is we should allow Irish people to avail of the same exemption and pay landlords the €850 tax-free sum in the same way as is done for the Ukrainian people. I am not asking that the Government stops that for them but that it gives the same leeway and the same allowance to Irish people. These are local people. They are not all Irish. There are people living here from many other countries for 20 years or more and they are on the housing list as well. To help all of them, the Government must create a level playing pitch and give the same allowance to them as it is giving to Ukrainians. A lot of house owners would avail of that because the rules are very different and the RTB is not involved.",
                "The RTB is the cause of many house owners not renting out their properties. When the RTB gets involved, your house is not your own any more. It is different with the Ukraine scheme and I am asking the Government to adapt it and use it. The Government would be able to utilise a multitude of houses in many different areas in a very short time because the houses are there. They do not have to be built. Many of them are perfectly good houses. I ask the Minister to allow that same exemption to the people on the waiting lists in this country. Many of them are on the list for up to 15 years, which is absolutely ridiculous. We are telling people with young families when they go on the housing list in Killarney, east Kerry, Kenmare or Killorglin that they will probably have to wait ten years before they are housed by the local authority. The Government would not be paying out as much HAP or rent allowance. There is an awful lot of work in administering those schemes. Even when people get HAP, they have to wait two or three months. There are housing officials involved for ages and it takes a long time to process. I ask the Government to consider this. I have been raising it for almost two years and was the very first Deputy to mention it. I am asking the Government to be fair. All we are asking in every case is for the Government to treat people fairly. Those who have been on the housing list for many years are not getting a fair crack of the whip. I ask the Minister to give the same allowance to those people."

As many TDs have said, this was a temporary measure that was brought in at a time there was a call on people who were working to try to save this country. We have gone on too long taking this money and need to put a stop to this unworkable charge on people's earnings. It does not bear any resemblance to fairness any more. Working people have paid their due for the folly of others and it is time that we put a plan in place to phase out the USC completely.",

He and his wife have to work to pay for their mortgage. He mentioned all of these kinds of things. He said that the one-off payments he gets are like giving a sweet to a child. It is not doing anything for the working person. It is important that we show respect to the working person.",
                "We have submitted an amendment, which we will not get to, in respect of VAT. I have spoken to many people in small industries in my constituency of Galway East. I am fearful that they are looking at an opt-out clause to get out of business. They feel that to have a business and to keep a coffee shop or whatever else going is costing them far more than they can earn. One of the things they said to me was that they can get a grant or a top-up, like the €4,000, which as I mentioned earlier is not available to everybody, and that needs to be addressed. Those people are paying rates that are not based on profit or anything other than the size of the floor area of their building. That is penal. These small businesses, including butchers, bakeries, hairdressers and all the other businesses, may not be huge employers but they employ many people across this country and give employment to young people when they are going to college. They train people and give them personal skills that nobody else can give them. Yet we are using small businesses again and not giving them the respect they need. Some of them will leave the market. One young businessman, who has been in business for five years, told me that if he knew then what he knows now about trying to run a business, he would never have started it.",

Parts of this legislation need scrutiny.",
                "I am concerned for farmers in my constituency in respect of the residential zoned land tax. I do not see what the Minister has brought forward. When the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, brought this legislation before the committee, I pointed out that there was an issue for farmers. He said there was no such issue but it was clear that there was. When the then Minister, former Deputy Michael McGrath, brought forward an amendment to last year's Finance Bill, I said nothing was going to change and the issue would not be resolved. He thought it was okay but it was not. The Government scrambled before the end of the summer to come up with this as a solution but I do not think it cuts the mustard. We are not even going to get the chance to discuss section 113 because we are only on section 2. There are serious concerns. It does not appear to me that the issue has been resolved. The legislation allows people to apply for a rezoning of land and if they apply, they are exempt. Is the Minister telling me that everybody who applies and does not have planning permission on their land will be exempt from this tax, regardless of whether they are farming? Perhaps the Minister can enlighten us on that point. How long does the exemption last? Does it last forever or does it last until a determination is made by the local authority that rezoning is being granted? What the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, did last time was to allow them to apply again for rezoning. Why are we not just exempting agricultural land that is in use? That is the most logical thing to do. The thing that should not be done is for this land, which is serviced, to be rezoned. If, for example, the farmer in question passed away and there was no agricultural activity on the land in the next number of years, it should come under a tax. However, for as long as it is being actively used in farming, there should be no whiff of a tax being applied. That is what we pointed out to the Government two years ago and we are still dealing with the issue. As happened with Deputies Donohoe and Michael McGrath, we are going to find there are issues with that section as it relates to farmers. It is a very detailed section that interacts with legislation that amends the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. We still do not have a consolidated Act, but that is another issue. I am concerned about that issue.",
                "I am also concerned about the issue I raised two years ago with the then Ministers, Deputies Donohoe and Michael McGrath, in respect of the loophole that existed for pensions. People were facilitated two years ago, through a loophole in the legislation, to load the pensions of their children or spouses so that they can get money out of a company, put it into the pension fund of their family members and use the taxation of that to draw down those funds. The first €200,000 is exempt and a rate of only 20% applies to the next €300,000. In fairness, the Revenue Commissioners said there was a problem and the Government has acknowledged that through this amendment. The issue was that it was not linked to the salary of the individual. Somebody could be employed temporarily. This is the situation until this legislation passes. If I own a shop and want to employ my partner, I can pay her the minimum wage and put €2 million from the company into her pension pot. The first €200,000 of that would be tax free and the next €300,000 would be taxed at a rate of €200,000. If I wanted to get that €2 million out of the company by other means, I would have to pay personal tax rates, USC, PRSI, etc., at a rough rate of 50%. That is a big problem. How the Government has dealt with the issue is insufficient. It has linked the amount that can be put into the pension by the employer to the wage. There is still, however, an incentive - and this is what I would have loved to tease out with the Minister on Committee Stage - for that employer to increase the wage of his or her partner in that year. It is not based on an average wage over a period but is based on the specific year. There is an incentive to increase the wage to allow for the money to pass into the pension. The employee will obviously benefit from tax reliefs in terms of pension contributions. The employer will benefit from being able to write off this contribution against his or her corporation tax. There is then the beneficial tax in relation to the first €200,000 lump sum being tax free and the 20% rate for the next €300,000. I do not know if that is deliberate or it is another loophole that the Government has left in the legislation. I am not sure, and we are not going to have time to go through it.",
                "I again question why the Minister continues to provide tax relief for landlords. The standard fund threshold is simply unfair. It is unfair that this amount of money is being provided to people who already have gold-plated pensions. The only people benefiting are those who already have a pension pot of €2 million. That is a massive pension pot that no ordinary public sector worker would have a sniff of. The Minister wants not only to increase it to €2.8 million by 2030 but wants to go further. I did the calculations. This is one of the only measures in our tax code that is index linked. Personal tax bands are not index linked. Tax credits that workers get are not index linked. The incapacitated tax credit for people who have children with additional needs and disabilities is not index linked in our tax code. Social welfare rates are not index linked in the Social Welfare Act. However, if you have a pension pot of €2 million, we are going to index link it. We are going to ensure tax relief is available on that pension pot not just up to €2.8 million, which was in the Government's press release. The Minister wants it to go up 3% or 4% every year according to inflation.",
                "On past performances, by 2038 that would be €4 million. Was it Bertie Ahern who said the boom times are getting boomier? Fianna Fáil is definitely back: landlords, tick; vulture funds, tick; the wealthiest in society with massive pensions, tick. This is just not on. We are not getting a chance to scrutinise this at all.",
                "I have an amendment here on the USC. This is an issue that really affects workers. As I said, we have made a commitment. I do not know what Fianna Fáil is going to do but nobody believes it, because it argued in the past that it would abolish it on everything under €80,000. We are very clear. The amendment is about making sure the average worker never pays the USC again, to make sure that every single worker never pays USC on the first €45,000 they earn. That is what the amendment proposes. I will be pressing that amendment if we have time today."

                "At present, when people look at the tax take out of their earnings they hurt very badly. When they go to the petrol pumps they hurt very badly because it is all tax, tax and more tax. As far as I can see, the Government is doing everything it can to penalise workers, to stop enterprise and to close down businesses. We asked - we actually begged - on behalf of people involved in business, to reduce the VAT rate. Those calls were ignored. The people are remembering that now when we call to the doors. They are asking why 615 restaurants closed. That is not taking into account all of the other small beautiful businesses, family businesses, for which mothers and fathers, grandparents and children put their shoulders to the wheel. They are shutting down because they cannot make ends meet. They cannot afford to keep going. There is no incentive for people to work at present. We want to keep people working. We want to encourage the person, the man or woman, who could be a hairdresser or a mechanic in a small way doing a bit of welding in the backyard. We want to encourage that. We want to keep those great people going.",
                "Sometimes a small business can grow into a big business. In County Kerry I think of great people such as those in Munster Joinery which started from very humble beginnings and now is a massive operation employing thousands of people and contractors, not just in Ireland but abroad as well. We have many examples of that in County Kerry, small businesses like Torc Precision Engineering, contractors like KPH Construction Services in Kenmare, organisations that started small and through diligence and hard work became bigger. They create employment and provide valuable services in the community. We want to see that type of business grow. However, there is no attitude in Government of supporting workers. There is not. The biggest problem in the Government is that so many of the Members themselves never employed people. They do not know what it is like to pay somebody on a Friday evening. I do not mean the Members personally, I mean the Government. It does not know what it is like to pay other people to do work and to try to keep a business going.",
                "Shops, pubs and hotels are struggling. The people involved in a certain type of business, in hospitality, are struggling to keep their doors open. The Government does not actually get that. Will they get it after this election? I do not know. Work has to be rewarded. We have to reward enterprise. Not to do so on this Government’s watch or on the watch of the incoming Government will mean paying a very high price. Only so much tax can be drawn out of people before they eventually give up. They will say they are not going to do this anymore because it is all take and no give.",
                "In regard to the incentives in the budget, I am not going to criticise anything that was given, but it is tokenism. What is being done to small businesses is tokenism. Talking about such things as energy rebates for households does not take away from the fact that energy costs have gone through the roof, because of the constant attack on our supply of electricity. The Government wants us to use more electricity while we produce less of it, at a higher cost. How many times have I to say that before it eventually hits home? Bringing in biomass material from Brazil and things like that is not exactly an answer to shutting down Bord na Móna. Such things will never be forgotten. It will be like long ago when Fine Gael took a farthing out of the old age pension. It was remembered for decades afterwards. The closure of Bord na Móna will be an epitaph that will never be forgotten.",
                "One of the few times Eamon Ryan actually left Dublin during Covid-19 was to go down to get his picture taken for the closure of Bord na Móna. These things are ridiculous and make no sense. We are getting that on the doorsteps. The Government is missing all of that. It seems to have lost the understanding of the basic things that Ireland is about, whether it is fishing or farming. In Kenmare bay this evening pair trawling is going on. I am sure Members know what pair trawling is. It is where every bit of fish that is in the bay is sucked up. It is so bad at present in Kenmare that seals are dying of starvation. That is a fact. When we had a population of seals along Kenmare Bay, sea safaris used to go out to look at the seals on the rocks, falling around the place, jumping in and out of the water. That cannot happen now because they are dead, due to starvation. The small fishermen are left with nothing. There are no fish all along the coastline of Kenmare River because tonight pair trawling is well under way.",
                "It is outrageous.",
                "The Government talks about the protection of the environment and it sides with the Greens on every type of rubbish but it will do nothing about pair trawling. It is plundering the seas; that is what it is doing. It makes no sense to suck up everything and then it is taken away, sent to a factory, mushed up and used as a meal. It is totally insane; all the different categories of fish are mushed up and made into a maize meal. It makes no sense. Why is the Government not looking at things like that? It is more interested in stopping people cutting a sod of turf for their own fires. The Government has lost the run of itself. Environmentally, if the Green Party stood for anything, it would be shouting every day over there about pair trawling but it does not. It is more interested in a cow belching. That is what it is more worried about. It does not make sense. I do not like being critical of people. I would love it if the Government was doing a good job because I would stand up and say it did something good. If you want me to point out something it did do well, which I voted for and was proud that the Government did was the homeowners protection Act where if you were upstairs in your house and somebody came up the stairs to attack you, the Government did something about that. I was glad of that. I put that on the record tonight to show that if I see the Government do something right, I will praise and compliment it. My god, when I see it do something wrong, my job is to stand up for Kerry, farmers, fishermen, business and say it has lost the run of itself."

Stakeholder consultations with the Courts Service in particular have supported this approach, not least because it would better align with the guiding principles in the Bill in being just and expeditious. The alternative arrangements I am proposing in these amendments are, as has always been the intention, directed at ensuring there will be consistency in approach to the making of family law rules right across the family court jurisdictions.

Legal reform and the construction of a dedicated family law court for Dublin are important but any credible family law plan must go further with supports and maybe the Minister should take a White Paper approach to the whole Bill. Not every issue before the courts can be addressed at the point where relationships are breaking down, but significant resources can be allocated to reduce the harm that can be caused to children. There are a number of difficulties with lengthy waits for court dates in some parts of the country, where it can take up to a year for contested cases to be heard. This is a lifetime for parents and for children given how quickly children are developing. The cases are often adjourned with no resolution and there is deep frustration then on behalf of some of the participants. Holding proceedings in a different building or room from the other courts sittings, and the criminal law list in particular, is also very important.",
                "In developing the new court system or the new court buildings that are going to be constructed it is important for the Courts Service to take into account the needs of the local community and of town centres in particular. For ten years now there has been an alternative proposition to construct a courthouse for Tralee in another part of the town. Not enough consideration has been given to the overall effect on the town centre. While I appreciate a court that has not been refurbished in over 40 years needs some incremental works to bring it in line with the needs of a modern court building, there has been a logjam and because of all the investment set aside for prisons in the 2024 budget and the Hammond Lane complex the other courthouses that need refurbishment have been left behind. There is an opportunity in Tralee because An Post is moving from the town centre to an industrial estate and there is space available. I do not see any TDs from Kilkenny, but a great job was done there seven or eight years ago on reopening the courthouse. Part of it was refurbished and there was a new section. There is not going to be a new courthouse in Tralee until at least 2027. In the meantime, if you are in a wheelchair and need to access the court building it cannot be done. There are no plans to ameliorate that situation over the next four years, which is the earliest point a new courthouse on the other side of town can be constructed. I am asking the Courts Service and whoever is going to be in government after the next election to take into account that it is possible to keep services in the centre of town - because there is no plan B if the existing court building moves – in Edward Street or Ashe Street and not move them outside of town. Another café closed in Tralee town centre this week and there is a problem with footfall. I am aware it is not just that as there are difficulties with rates, rents and all the usual struggles small businesses cope with but any town centre worth its salt needs to keep services in town centre locations and I urge the Courts Service and governments to bear that in mind and take a decision that takes into account the common good of the whole town centre. There is no point in talking about a town centre first plan unless we deliver it by dealing with the services in an appropriate way.",
                "As I said, we will not be opposing the passage of the Bill, but there is an awful lot of work to be done in addressing the lengthy delays I mentioned as people wait for court dates, the lack of family law solicitors in some parts of the country, especially under the legal aid scheme, and the ongoing impoverishment of some participants, especially single parents who are not receiving maintenance with the consequential delays."

                "I, too, welcome any efforts made to reform the family law courts. Courthouses like those in Clonmel, Tipperary and Nenagh do not have the facilities for separation of families from criminal law, so they are all in the one building. That does not make for good, pleasant or easy management for anybody, but most importantly for the family.",
                "The Minister will say I am always critical but I welcome that the Clonmel Garda station, which was bundled, along with one I Cork I think, with the new child and family courts has been unbundled and we are making some progress in Clonmel. The town has been waiting for a Garda station for 70 years. It was first raised here by Séan Treacy, God rest him, 60 years ago. The Clonmel station was bundled in with family law courts, but they are two different items altogether. There is no comparison. Direct funding to build and deliver and people to do that can be got for Garda stations but not for court buildings. They are not the same people. The architectural ambience and everything else are different. That was a welcome development.",
                "There are lots of issues in the family courts. The fact that children are being separated and children go missing in State care must, surely to God, cost the Minister sleepless nights. The Minister, Deputy O’Gorman, says Tusla and its actions do not cause him any loss of sleep. We had a case in Donegal last week where a mother was acquitted by a jury after a ten-week trial. She was acquitted of accusations she was sexually abusing her child. The children were taken and separated. It went on for ten weeks and has been going on for years. She had lived in a terribly violent relationship and then became victimised by the State. Fortunately, a jury, which is the ultimate in our courts – trial by your peers – cleared this woman, but what about the damage done to the children?",
                "Ongoing damage is being done to children across the State from being taken into care. I met foster parents here last week and I support them as well but all is not well with the family law courts. While NGOs of all shapes and sizes are getting more than €6 billion in funding, the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, defunded the Child Law Project, the only watchdog adjudicating on what was going on in family law. He did not like its reports because they were rightly critical of what is going on in the children's courts and with Tusla so he defunded the group. How could he be so biased in his opinion? I would love to be able to say I do not have a sleepless night when one child goes missing, never mind a large number of children in State care. We saw the case in Cork when the university did the investigation. Children in State care were being trafficked and used in brothels. As a grandparent of young children, it is sickening and revolting. There are many issues that need to be sorted and this Bill does not address many of them. It is time that we did. While I know it is not in the Bill, I plead that funding be restored to the one watchdog that was safeguarding children."

Courthouses were run down because of the lack of finance and resources going into them. There are many things we could vote against or criticise but this is constructive and positive. It is important to separate out family courts. This is a very good start. We have been waiting far too long. We know the background to the proposed building on Hammond Lane. This is most certainly a start. We need to see it expanded to other areas. Even if only interim arrangements are made in other areas, it is important to have that separation because it is daunting for anyone to have to go into a courthouse. When family court issues are separated out, it is a far better experience for people who are going to find the experience difficult anyway. We will be supporting this legislation."

                "I warmly welcome this Bill and thank the Minister for her determination in bringing it this far. The Ceann Comhairle can take a lot of credit for allowing the discussion that brought about this situation to take place. Legislators cannot legislate, even for the courts, unless they can discuss the legislation in the Legislature. I therefore thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing that debate to take place in the House to highlight the needs. It is hoped the Bill will be a landmark Bill that addresses issues of unfairness where parents - mostly mothers but some fathers as well - find themselves and their children severely disadvantaged as a result of the system that was operating heretofore. It is reassuring to know that we have come this far and that a review of the in camera rule is also now taking place. That will be very important because Tusla and other agencies have not been able to get involved in certain matters on the basis of the in camera rule. Any family issue arising in court that is covered by the in camera rule cannot be discussed by Tusla in a public arena. Tusla cannot intervene and has often been wrongly blamed for a failure to exert itself. I give all credit to everybody who made it happen. It will be a great leap forward for fairness in the family law courts. While it might not solve everything, at least it will bring society and the House to a point at which we can see fairness and fair play being administered all around. We hope that we will not see situations where children are removed from their parents in an aggressive way in order to comply with rules created as a result of section 32 or section 47. In many cases, such decisions were not allowed to be challenged. The legislation the Minister has produced, for which she is to be congratulated, will go an awful long way - I hope it will go the entire way - towards protecting parents and children while, at the same time, ensuring that the law is enforced."

As I have said many times before, the overall objective of the Bill is to make sure that we can, insofar as possible, make what is often the most difficult time a family will go through that little bit easier by putting in place these structures, making our family courts more accessible, more affordable and, where possible, less adversarial. That is the overall objective of the Bill.",
                "I will respond to some of the points raised. For this Bill to be enacted is one thing but in order for it to be implemented, resources and structures will be needed. I have already started that work by expanding our courts system, particularly our Judiciary. There are 31 new judges in our system who were not there three years ago. Only in the last week, I received approval for 20 more additional judges. With those judges, we are already seeing a reduction in times and backlogs in our District Court, Circuit Court and High Court, including in cases involving family law matters. It is important that these 20 additional judges, their supporting staff and continued investment in our modernisation programme and capital programme be put in place before we can fully enact and stand up this legislation.",
                "On investment in infrastructure, we have an overall capital budget for our courts of €67 million annually. The new government, whatever form that may take, will need to look at further expanding this under the national development plan, NDP, to make sure that further projects can be included as we expand our family courts and our courts in general. We need to make sure that we have space for the additional judges I have mentioned and that we continue to expand and improve access to justice. The project at Hammond Lane is progressing. It has obviously been a significant challenge and it is still that hole in the ground we all drive past regularly. However, it is progressing and moving through the different stages. I am absolutely confident that we will see building works starting as soon as possible.",
                "In tandem with this legislation, the family justice strategy is really important. A number of elements of this are already progressing. Work is under way on maintenance and on making sure that maintenance orders can be effected. That requires a number of different measures. The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and I have been working to progress the recommendations. We recently introduced reports on the voice of the child and the welfare of the child. Again, we need to make sure that there are proper structures and oversight, that these reports are paid for and that the burden is not on the families. To Deputy Durkan's point, we also need to ensure there is a way to make a complaint if unfairness is perceived or if issues arise. A review of the in camera rule is already under way, as are many other measures that I hope will complement the family courts structure, support it and make sure that families going through this really difficult time are supported.",
                "I again thank colleagues for their support. These amendments in particular are to make sure that the rules of court are set out in the most efficient manner possible, that our judges are part of the various different committees and that the courts work effectively with them should any issues or concerns arise."

That Department has proposed the extension of concurrent jurisdictions for the family District Court and the family Circuit Court in the broad range of care proceedings under the 1991 Act, particularly to enable especially complex cases to be dealt with at family Circuit Court level where considered necessary. The Child and Family Agency, Tusla, would be in a position, in light of the circumstances of a case, to decide the jurisdictional level at which a case should be initiated. The Child Care Act 1991 provides statutory time limits for a case to be brought before a court in the case of certain types of childcare proceedings. Provision is being made to continue to enable matters to be dealt with in the general District Court where no sitting of the relevant family court can be arranged within the time limit. This will protect the interests of the child to whom the proceedings relate. The proposed amendments to this section insert the family Circuit Court and District Court as appropriate as courts where such proceedings can be determined. An additional amendment provides as a consequential of the jurisdictional extension for the term referring to the judge of the court is clarified. The term now encompasses a judge of the family District Court, the family Circuit Court and the District Court, as appropriate. Emergency care orders can continue to be dealt with by the District Court, as they have always been, and where considerable expertise in such matters has accrued.",

It is well recognised that success in addressing public health problems such as tobacco consumption entails multiple evidence-based interventions in order to affect usage and that no single measure is effective on its own. As our next national tobacco control policy is being developed, consideration will be given to product-focused measures, institution- or structure-focused measures, user-focused measures and supply-related measures. I see no reason to limit consideration to de-nicotinisation alone, which would be a consequence of Deputy Cullinane’s amendment.",

In 2017, funding for the HSE Tobacco Free Ireland programme was €11.8 million. By 2021, that had risen to €13.2 million, and by 2023 it had risen to €17 million. As a result of those increases, in 2022 an additional 44 stop-smoking advisers were hired, increasing the number of clinics by 100%. In 2023, the HSE rolled out free nicotine-replacement therapy for everyone accessing its smoking-cessation services. As part of budget 2024, an additional €1.1 million was secured by the Minister for the free nicotine replacement therapy scheme, and he is maintaining that in 2025."

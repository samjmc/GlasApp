const ANALYSIS_PROMPT = (article: any, politician: any, partyPositions: any = {}) => `
You are a MAXIMALLY TRUTH-SEEKING political analyst evaluating Irish TD ${politician.name} from ${politician.constituency}.

**CORE PRINCIPLE - TRUTH ABOVE ALL:**

Your PRIMARY DUTY is to seek truth with intellectual honesty, not to be kind, lenient, or favorable.

- ✅ BE RIGOROUS: Question every claim, verify against facts
- ✅ BE SKEPTICAL: Don't accept spin at face value
- ✅ BE HONEST: If something is bad, say it's bad (objectively)
- ✅ BE FAIR: Apply the SAME standards to all TDs regardless of party
- ✅ BE PRECISE: Use evidence, not assumptions
- ❌ DON'T sugarcoat problems or scandals
- ❌ DON'T give benefit of doubt without evidence
- ❌ DON'T be influenced by the TD's popularity or party
- ❌ DON'T accept PR spin as fact

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION - Score PROCESS not POLICY:**
- DO score: HOW they do their job (transparency, honesty, consistency)
- DON'T score: WHETHER their policies are good/bad (users decide that!)

**TRUTH-SEEKING STANDARDS:**
- If they lied or misled → Transparency: 0-20 (be harsh!)
- If they broke promises → Consistency: 0-30 (no excuses!)
- If there's corruption → Integrity: 0-20 (zero tolerance!)
- If they failed to deliver → Effectiveness: 0-40 (actions > words!)

**Don't be generous unless the evidence supports it.**

Article:
- Title: ${article.title}
- Content: ${article.content}
- Source: ${article.source}
- Date: ${article.published_date}

**CRITICAL - ANALYZE THIS SPECIFIC ARTICLE:**

You MUST analyze THIS article about THIS politician. DO NOT copy example values.

**CRITICAL RULE - TD AS VICTIM:**
If the TD is a VICTIM (receiving threats, being attacked, targeted by others), this is NOT negative for them:
- ✅ Receiving threats → NEUTRAL (0 impact) or slightly positive (shows they're significant)
- ✅ Being criticized by opponents → NEUTRAL (normal politics) unless criticism exposes real wrongdoing
- ✅ Being mentioned without actions → NEUTRAL (0 impact) - no action = no score change
- ❌ DON'T penalize TDs for being victims of others' actions

**CRITICAL RULE - NO INFORMATION:**
If the article provides NO INFORMATION about the TD's actions, transparency, effectiveness, or integrity:
- impact_score MUST be 0 (neutral)
- story_type MUST be "neutral"
- DO NOT give negative scores just because information is absent

REQUIRED: Provide SPECIFIC evidence from the article for EACH score:
- Why did you give transparency: X? (Quote specific facts about THEIR actions)
- Why did you give integrity: Y? (What ethical issues or lack thereof in THEIR behavior?)
- Why did you give effectiveness: Z? (What did THEY deliver or fail to deliver?)
- Why did you give consistency: W? (Any contradictions in THEIR positions?)

**SCORING RULES - PROCESS ONLY:**

**Transparency (0-100):** How open and honest were they about this?

TRUTH-SEEKING STANDARD: Were they truthful or deceptive? Did they hide anything?

- 90-100: Proactively disclosed EVERYTHING, answered ALL questions, complete openness, verifiable facts
- 70-89: Clearly explained, responded to questions, mostly open and truthful
- 50-69: Basic info provided, some questions dodged, not fully forthcoming
- 30-49: Vague explanations, avoided questions, clearly hiding something, evasive
- 0-29: Lying, hiding information, refusing FOI requests, deliberately deceptive

BE HARSH on deception. Truth-seeking means calling out dishonesty.

**Effectiveness (0-100):** Did they actually DO what they said?

TRUTH-SEEKING STANDARD: Actions vs words. Results vs rhetoric. Delivery vs promises.

- 90-100: FULLY delivered on promise, on time, as stated, verifiable results, concrete outcomes
- 70-89: Delivered most of it, minor delays but substantive results
- 50-69: Partially delivered, significant delays, incomplete results, more talk than action
- 30-49: Failed to deliver most of it, major delays, broken promises, mostly rhetoric
- 0-29: Complete failure, NO delivery, all talk no action, empty promises

BE HARSH on empty promises and announcements. Truth-seeking means judging results, not rhetoric.

**Integrity (0-100):** Any ethical issues in HOW they did this?

TRUTH-SEEKING STANDARD: Are they corrupt? Do they have conflicts of interest?

- 90-100: No conflicts of interest, followed ALL rules, completely ethical, no concerns
- 70-89: Minor concerns but nothing serious, mostly clean
- 50-69: Some questionable decisions, borderline ethical issues, concerning patterns
- 30-49: Clear conflicts of interest, ethics violations, self-dealing, corrupt behavior
- 0-29: Blatant corruption, fraud, major violations, criminal behavior, betrayed public trust

BE HARSH on corruption and conflicts. Truth-seeking means zero tolerance for ethics violations.

**Consistency (0-100):** Did they flip-flop or stay consistent?

TRUTH-SEEKING STANDARD: Did they keep their word or betray their stated principles?

- 90-100: Completely consistent with past statements/votes, kept their word, principled
- 70-89: Mostly consistent, minor shifts with legitimate explanation
- 50-69: Some inconsistencies, contradictions, shifting positions

**TD Policy Stance:** What position did the TD take on the policy in this article?

CRITICAL: This is for tracking USER agreement with TDs AND updating TD ideology profiles.

- **stance**: 
  - "support" = TD advocates FOR this policy, defends it, votes for it
  - "oppose" = TD criticizes policy, votes against it, wants it stopped
  - "neutral" = TD acknowledges it exists but doesn't take a clear position
  - "unclear" = Article doesn't show TD's stance clearly

- **strength** (1-5):
  - 5 = Strongly advocating (leading the charge, primary sponsor)
  - 4 = Clearly supporting/opposing (vocal about it)
  - 3 = Moderate support/opposition (mentioned their position)
  - 2 = Weak stance (barely mentioned, passive)
  - 1 = Implied stance only

- **evidence**: Quote the specific words/actions from the article

- **policy_topic**: Brief label like "IPAS rent charges", "housing intervention", "healthcare reform"

- **ideology_delta** (NEW): How does this stance shift the TD's ideology? (scale -0.5 to +0.5 per dimension, 0 = no shift)
  
  CRITICAL CALIBRATION - Be conservative with signals. Single articles are weak evidence:
  - **±0.4 to ±0.5:** STRONG ideological action (major policy implementation, voting record, leading advocacy)
  - **±0.2 to ±0.3:** CLEAR position (explicit defense, vocal advocacy, direct action)
  - **±0.1 to ±0.2:** MODERATE signal (stated position, mentioned stance, implied)
  - **±0.05 to ±0.1:** WEAK signal (tangential, questioned, debated)
  - **0.0:** No clear ideological information
  
  Map this stance to ideology dimensions:
  - economic (market vs collective): e.g., tax cuts (+0.3), public spending (-0.3)
  - social (traditional vs progressive): e.g., conservative policy (+0.3), liberal policy (-0.3)
  - cultural (nationalism vs multiculturalism): e.g., immigration restriction (+0.3), multiculturalism (-0.3)
  - authority (authoritarian vs libertarian): e.g., police powers (+0.3), civil liberties (-0.3)
  - environmental (pro-business vs pro-climate): e.g., growth focus (+0.3), green policy (-0.3)
  - welfare (decrease vs increase): e.g., welfare cuts (+0.3), welfare expansion (-0.3)
  - globalism (national vs global): e.g., Ireland-first (+0.3), EU integration (-0.3)
  - technocratic (populist vs expert): e.g., popular will (+0.3), expert-led (-0.3)
  
  IMPORTANT: Map ACTIONS, not just words. Reality: ideology emerges from PATTERN, not single events.
  
  Examples:
  - "Announces €1bn welfare increase" → welfare: -0.4 (strong action), social: -0.1 (associated)
  - "Defends welfare policy" → welfare: -0.2 (clear position)
  - "Questions welfare timing" → welfare: +0.1 (weak signal)
  - "Mentioned in welfare debate" → welfare: 0.0 (no clear stance)

Examples:
- Minister defends new tax → support, strength 4, ideology_delta: {economic: +0.3, welfare: +0.1}
- Opposition TD criticizes cuts → oppose, strength 4, ideology_delta: {welfare: -0.3, social: -0.2}
- TD questions implementation → neutral, strength 2, ideology_delta: {} (no clear shift)

**Classification (NEW):** Classify the article content as:
- "rhetorical": Party talking points, vague language, emotional appeals, no specifics
- "substantive": Specific policy details, numbers, concrete proposals, technical details
- "mixed": Combination of rhetoric and substance

- 30-49: Major flip-flops, says one thing does another, contradicts previous positions
- 0-29: Complete reversal, blatant hypocrisy, political opportunism, betrayed principles

BE HARSH on flip-flopping for political gain. Truth-seeking means exposing hypocrisy.

**CRITICAL - Is This Opposition Advocacy?**

Set is_opposition_advocacy = true if the TD is:
- ✅ Calling out a problem or crisis
- ✅ Criticizing government policy
- ✅ Questioning ministers or government actions
- ✅ Demanding action from government
- ✅ Raising concerns about an issue
- ✅ Advocating for constituents/groups
- ✅ Meeting with ministers to press for change
- ✅ Highlighting a failure or issue

Set is_opposition_advocacy = false if the TD is:
- ❌ Announcing their own achievements
- ❌ Taking credit for funding/projects
- ❌ Promising future actions
- ❌ Unveiling their own plans
- ❌ Defending their own actions

**Examples:**
- "McDonald says Lough Neagh is a crisis" → is_opposition_advocacy: true
- "Harris calls for immigration reform" → is_opposition_advocacy: true (if in opposition)
- "Minister announces €100M funding" → is_opposition_advocacy: false
- "TD unveils housing plan" → is_opposition_advocacy: false

**CRITICAL - Flip-Flop Detection Against Party Position:**

${politician.party ? `
The TD is from ${politician.party}. Their party's ESTABLISHED positions on key dimensions are:
- Cultural/Immigration: ${partyPositions.cultural_score || 'unknown'} (scale: -10 to +10)
  * ${partyPositions.cultural_score > 5 ? '🔴 RESTRICTIVE immigration stance' : partyPositions.cultural_score < -2 ? '🟢 OPEN/PRO-IMMIGRATION stance' : '⚪ MODERATE stance'}
- Economic: ${partyPositions.economic_score || 'unknown'} (-10=left, +10=right)
- Social: ${partyPositions.social_score || 'unknown'} (-10=liberal, +10=conservative)
- Environmental: ${partyPositions.environmental_score || 'unknown'} (-10=growth, +10=green)
- Welfare: ${partyPositions.welfare_score || 'unknown'} (-10=restrictive, +10=generous)

**YOUR CRITICAL TASK**: Determine if ${politician.name} is CONTRADICTING ${politician.party}'s position:

IMPORTANT EXAMPLES:
- If ${politician.party} has cultural_score = +3 (moderate pro-immigration)
  AND the TD is calling for "immigration restrictions" or saying "numbers too high"
  → This is a MAJOR flip-flop (at least 8 points deviation)
  → Set flip_flop_detected = "major"
  
- If the article mentions RIOTS or VIOLENCE in context of immigration
  AND the TD shifts to a more restrictive position
  → This is SUSPICIOUS TIMING (responding to pressure, not principles)
  → Set suspicious_timing = true

Set "flip_flop_detected" based on how far TD deviates from party position:
- "major": 8+ points away (e.g., party=+3 pro-immigration, TD taking anti-immigration stance)
- "moderate": 5-7 points away
- "minor": 3-4 points away  
- "none": within 3 points (normal party variation)

Set "flip_flop_explanation" to explain:
- What dimension they deviated on
- How far they deviated from party position
- Whether this seems like principles or political opportunism

Set "suspicious_timing" to true if:
- Article mentions riots/arson/violence AND TD suddenly changes position
- TD responding to political pressure vs standing by principles
- Timing suggests knee-jerk reaction vs thoughtful policy evolution
` : ''}


**CRITICAL - Is This Ideologically Divisive?**

If the article is about a POLICY where reasonable people disagree:
- ✅ "Asylum seeker rent" → is_ideological_policy: true
- ✅ "Carbon tax increase" → is_ideological_policy: true
- ✅ "Welfare cuts" → is_ideological_policy: true
- ✅ "Immigration controls" → is_ideological_policy: true
- ❌ "Corruption scandal" → is_ideological_policy: false (everyone agrees bad)
- ❌ "Broke campaign promise" → is_ideological_policy: false (objective)

**For ideological policies:**
- Extract FACTS neutrally (amounts, people, timeline)
- Extract what BOTH sides say (supporters + critics)
- Score PROCESS (were they transparent? consistent? honest?)
- DON'T judge if policy is good/bad → Users vote on that!

**For non-ideological (scandals, corruption, lying):**
- Score normally (everyone agrees these are bad)
- Negative impact_score appropriate

**Policy Direction Classification:**
- progressive: Left-wing policy (welfare, immigration, rights)
- conservative: Right-wing policy (fiscal, security, traditional)
- centrist: Middle-ground compromise
- technical: Non-ideological procedural matter

**Examples:**

GOOD (Process scoring):
- "TD promised hospital funding, delivered 90% on time" → effectiveness: 90
- "TD announced policy, explained it clearly in Dáil" → transparency: 85
- "TD flip-flopped on carbon tax after election" → consistency: 25

BAD (Policy judgment - DON'T do this):
- "TD introduced asylum seeker rent" → DON'T score as positive or negative!
- "TD increased welfare" → DON'T score as good!
- "TD cut taxes" → DON'T score as bad!

Extract neutral facts instead, let users decide if they support the policy.

You are analyzing an Irish political news article to identify which TDs (Teachtaí Dála - members of parliament) are SUBSTANTIALLY relevant.

Article:
Title: ${article.title}
Content: ${article.content?.substring(0, 2000) || article.description || ''}

Your task: Identify ALL TDs who are:
1. Directly mentioned by name (e.g., "Simon Harris said...")
2. Referenced by title only (e.g., "The Tánaiste defended..." = Simon Harris)
3. Part of a group mentioned (e.g., "Opposition TDs criticized..." = identify specific TDs if named)
4. Affected by policy discussed (e.g., "Government housing plan..." = Housing Minister)
5. Making or defending decisions

Current Government (for title mapping):
- Taoiseach: Micheál Martin (Fianna Fáil)
- Tánaiste: Simon Harris (Fine Gael)
- Minister for Housing: Darragh O'Brien (Fianna Fáil)
- Minister for Health: Stephen Donnelly (Fianna Fáil)
- Minister for Finance: Michael McGrath (Fianna Fáil)
- Minister for Justice: Helen McEntee (Fine Gael)

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Only include TDs if they are SUBSTANTIALLY involved in the story
- For generic "opposition TDs" without specific names, return empty array
- For titles like "Tánaiste", map to the correct person (Simon Harris)
- Be conservative - only include TDs who are clearly relevant
- Return empty array if article is just general news without specific TD involvement

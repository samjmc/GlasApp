Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (46/100): Perfect attendance but zero bills or questions—Jack needs to start tabling private-members’ motions and ramp up written PQs.

Parliamentary Engagement (43/100): Solid behind-the-scenes work as a senior minister, yet only around ten speeches and no committee leadership; next step is to chair or vice-chair a committee and take a more vocal floor role.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and strong casework keep voters happy. Securing larger, high-profile local projects would further strengthen his standing.

Public & Media Impact (65/100): Good press visibility and a robust online following; continuing to engage with national media and growing his social channels will amplify his reach.

Jack Chambers combines ministerial responsibility with dependable constituency work—but to push his next scorecard into the “very good” range, he’ll need to sponsor legislation, up his parliamentary question-writing, and snag some eye-catching local wins.

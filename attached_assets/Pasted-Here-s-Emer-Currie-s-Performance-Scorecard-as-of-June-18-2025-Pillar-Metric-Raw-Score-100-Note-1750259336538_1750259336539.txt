Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (45/100): Excellent attendance but no bills or questions to date. Next: table private-members’ motions and ramp up PQs.

Parliamentary Engagement (40/100): Contributes in committees and a handful of floor speeches, but needs to seek committee leadership and speak more often.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and solid casework; securing higher-profile local projects will boost this.

Public & Media Impact (45/100): A foothold in local media and a modest social-media base; expanding national press outreach and accelerating follower growth are key.

Emer Currie’s foundations are steady, but to lift her next scorecard she’ll need to sponsor legislation, amplify her parliamentary questions and speeches, and broaden her media footprint.

Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (59/100): Dara Calleary has sponsored a couple of private-members’ bills and maintains a solid voting attendance, but could boost his legislative footprint by introducing more PMBs to shape the agenda.

Parliamentary Engagement (58/100): Active in committee work and delivers a fair number of floor speeches; aiming for a committee chair role or front-bench contribution would further elevate his profile.

Constituency Service (58/100): Steady clinics and a strong casework resolution rate reflect effective local engagement—securing landmark projects (e.g., major infrastructure or housing schemes) could push this pillar higher.

Public & Media Impact (73/100): A healthy social-media following and regular national press coverage place him ahead of many peers; targeted national-media interviews and a digital outreach campaign could convert this into broader visibility.

Overall, Minister Calleary demonstrates solid attendance, engagement, and local service, with particular strength in media impact. To climb on the next scorecard, he should turn that visibility into sponsored legislation, seek leadership positions within committees, and leverage his ministerial platform for high-profile policy initiatives.

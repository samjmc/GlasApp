Build a political compass-style web app using HTML, CSS (Tailwind), and JavaScript that does the following:

---

### 1. QUIZ STRUCTURE
- Ask 12–15 political/philosophical questions.
- For each question:
  - Offer 4 multiple choice answers (A–D), each with predefined values on:
    - Economic axis (-10 = far left, +10 = far right)
    - Social axis (-10 = libertarian, +10 = authoritarian)
  - Allow the user to enter a **custom free-text answer** instead.
    - For now, simulate GPT scoring of the input (e.g., via simple keyword logic or dummy weighting).
    - Plan to connect to OpenAI GPT API later.

---

### 2. RESULT PAGE
After the quiz, show the user:

- A 2D compass plot (X = economic, Y = social)
- A GPT-style ideology summary
- 3–5 **historical or famous political figures** who have similar coordinates (from a JSON list)
- A “Your Unique Combo” section that highlights ideological contradictions or rare combinations
- **A country dropdown filter** to view closest **political parties by nation**
  - Default to **Ireland**
  - Show list of parties per country with coordinates and a short description
  - Support Ireland, France, US, UK (add more later)

---

### 3. BONUS FEATURE: POLITICAL ASSISTANT
- A text box at the end saying:  
  **“Where should I stand on [topic] based on my political views?”**
- Use pre-written logic to return suggestions like:  
  “As a socially liberal economic moderate, you may support carbon taxation with rebates.”

### 4. EXTRA FEATURES
- Share results via link or image
- “Compare with a friend” via URL or code
- Light/dark mode toggle
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- Fun loading animation before showing results

---

### 5. TECHNICAL NOTES
- Use dummy data (JSON or JS object) for:
  - Questions and answer weights
  - Historical figures
  - Party profiles per country (start with Ireland)
- Score user answers, average scores, and plot them.
- Store country filters in a dropdown.
- Make app AI-ready for integration with GPT-4 later.

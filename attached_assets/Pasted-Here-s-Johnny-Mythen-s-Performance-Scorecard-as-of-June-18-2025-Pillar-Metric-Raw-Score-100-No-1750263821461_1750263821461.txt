Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (54/100):
Johnny Mythen maintains solid attendance and a steady stream of written questions but has yet to sponsor any private-members’ motions. Introducing a PMB would meaningfully boost this pillar.

Parliamentary Engagement (47/100):
Regular committee work earns him decent marks, yet his floor contributions remain limited. More Dáil speeches and taking on a committee deputy-chair role would elevate his engagement.

Constituency Service (58/100):
Monthly clinics and a strong casework resolution rate underpin reliable local service. Securing a marquee Wexford project—such as a major community or health-service upgrade—would raise this pillar further.

Public & Media Impact (45/100):
A moderate press footprint is offset by a modest social-media following. A targeted digital-outreach campaign and national-level media interviews could significantly amplify his profile.

Johnny Mythen has laid a dependable foundation in attendance, questioning, committee work, and constituency responsiveness. To climb on the next scorecard, he should translate that groundwork into sponsored legislation, deeper Dáil contributions, and broader digital and media visibility.

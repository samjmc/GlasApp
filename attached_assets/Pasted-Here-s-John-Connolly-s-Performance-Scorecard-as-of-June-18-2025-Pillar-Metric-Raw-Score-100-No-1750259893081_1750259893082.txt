Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (67/100): Excellent attendance and a robust 215 written questions, but no sponsored bills—next step: table a private-members’ motion.

Parliamentary Engagement (65/100): Solid committee inputs and about ten floor speeches; boosting debate frequency and seeking a committee leadership role will help.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and strong casework underpin his local standing; securing a marquee community or transport project would further enhance this.

Public & Media Impact (55/100): A moderate press profile and growing social-media base indicate promise—expanding into national media outlets and driving digital engagement are key.

John Connolly has combined diligent oversight with dependable constituency work; converting that energy into sponsored legislation and headline local wins will be crucial to lifting his next scorecard.

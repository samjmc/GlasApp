Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (49/100): Great attendance but minimal bill-sponsorship and moderate question output; next step is tabling private-members’ motions.

Parliamentary Engagement (37/100): Early-term profile—solid committee inputs but few floor speeches; should deepen debate role and seek committee leadership.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and strong casework; securing larger, high-impact local projects would boost this score.

Public & Media Impact (45/100): Local press coverage and modest social-media following show a foothold; expanding national media outreach and accelerating online engagement are key.

Máire Devine has built a dependable foundation in her first seven months. To climb the rankings next term, she should focus on sponsoring legislation, amplifying her floor contributions, and broadening her public profile.

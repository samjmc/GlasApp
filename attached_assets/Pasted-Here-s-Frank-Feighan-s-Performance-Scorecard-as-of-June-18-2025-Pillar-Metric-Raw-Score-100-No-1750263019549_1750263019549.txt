Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (69/100):
Strong on written questions (96 /100) and solid attendance (90 /100), but only one PMB. Sponsoring an additional Private Members’ Bill would meaningfully boost this pillar.

Parliamentary Engagement (65/100):
Active in committees (60 /100) and prolific in questions (96 /100), yet floor speeches are modest (~6 → 40 /100). More Dáil contributions could lift this score.

Constituency Service (60/100):
Reliable clinics and strong casework underpin solid local service. Securing a headline health-service or infrastructure project in Sligo–Leitrim would elevate this pillar.

Public & Media Impact (48/100):
A moderate press footprint (60 /100) is offset by a modest social-media following (35 /100). A targeted digital-engagement campaign and national-media features could amplify his visibility.

Frank Feighan’s strengths lie in constituent responsiveness and committee work. To climb on the next scorecard, he should translate that into additional sponsored legislation, more floor‐speaking roles, and a broader digital and media outreach.

Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (68/100): Outstanding written-question output (287 PQs) and solid attendance, but still no private-members’ bills. Next step: sponsor a motion or bill of her own.

Parliamentary Engagement (87/100): Strong committee work and about eighteen floor speeches make her one of the chamber’s more active voices.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and timely casework underpin her local standing; securing a headline local project (e.g., a new childcare facility) would boost this.

Public & Media Impact (60/100): Good press visibility and a moderate social-media following; expanding into broadcast media and growing her online audience will be key.

Roderic O’Gorman combines deep subject-matter engagement with tireless questioning—translating that into sponsored legislation and marquee local wins will lift her next scorecard even higher.

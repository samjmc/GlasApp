Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (51/100): Perfect attendance but very low bill-sponsoring and question output; Danny needs to crank up PQs beyond the current 92 and introduce private-members’ motions.

Parliamentary Engagement (44/100): Contributes moderately in committee and with about six speeches; stepping into a committee leadership role and speaking more frequently would help.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and solid casework underpin his standing; securing a marquee local project (e.g., major transport or community centre funding) would boost this.

Public & Media Impact (45/100): A modest press footprint and social-media base suggest room to grow; broadening into national outlets and more aggressive digital engagement are key.

Danny Healy-Rae’s foundation is attendance and constituency work—but to climb the rankings, he must convert presence into tabled motions, a higher PQ count, and a stronger media profile.

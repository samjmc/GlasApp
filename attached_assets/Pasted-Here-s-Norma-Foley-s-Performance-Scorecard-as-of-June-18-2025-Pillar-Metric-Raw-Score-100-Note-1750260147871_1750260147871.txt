Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (46/100): Perfect attendance but no written questions or sponsored bills—Norma needs to crank up PQs and table a private-members’ motion.

Parliamentary Engagement (37/100): Consistent committee inputs but a low floor-speech count; stepping into a committee leadership role and delivering more Dáil contributions will be key.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and strong casework form a solid base; securing a larger-scale local project would push this pillar higher.

Public & Media Impact (43/100): A foothold in local media and a modest social-media following show potential—broadening national press outreach and boosting digital engagement are next steps.

Norma Foley’s foundation is solid on attendance and constituency work, but to climb the charts she must find her voice in questions, debates, and sponsored legislation, while amplifying her media presence.

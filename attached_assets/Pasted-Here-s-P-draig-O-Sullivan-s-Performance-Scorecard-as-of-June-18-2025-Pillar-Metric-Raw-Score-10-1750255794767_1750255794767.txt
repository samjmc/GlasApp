Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (68/100): Outstanding attendance and high volume of parliamentary questions, but still no sponsored bills.

Parliamentary Engagement (62/100): Solid committee work and question-asking; could expand floor-speech contributions.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and strong casework resolution; moderate success on local school and ASD funding.

Public & Media Impact (50/100): Steady regional media footprint and social-media presence; opportunity to amplify national profile.

Pádraig O’Sullivan combines exceptional diligence in questions and voting with dedicated constituency outreach, while the next step is to translate that engagement into private members’ bills and a higher-profile public platform.

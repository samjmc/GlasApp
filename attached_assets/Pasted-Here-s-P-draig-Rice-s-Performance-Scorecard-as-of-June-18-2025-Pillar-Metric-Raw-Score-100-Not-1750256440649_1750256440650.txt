Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (60/100): Strong question-asking and perfect attendance, but no sponsored legislation.

Parliamentary Engagement (60/100): Leadership as Health Committee chair boosts this, though floor-speech volume is still modest.

Constituency Service (60/100): Regular clinics and solid casework, with some targeted local health wins.

Public & Media Impact (50/100): Steady regional press and social-media presence; opportunity to broaden national profile.

Pádraig Rice has hit the ground running in his first term—using questions and committee leadership to make an impact—while his next steps are sponsoring private members’ bills and scaling up his Dáil-floor contributions.

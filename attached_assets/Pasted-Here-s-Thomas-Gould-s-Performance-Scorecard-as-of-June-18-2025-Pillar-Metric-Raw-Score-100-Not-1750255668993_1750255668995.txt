Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (59/100): Exemplary attendance and solid use of written questions, but no sponsored bills yet.

Parliamentary Engagement (53/100): Steady committee participation and Q&A, though floor speeches could be increased.

Constituency Service (60/100): Regular clinics and effective casework; moderate success on local grant wins.

Public & Media Impact (50/100): Decent regional press presence and social-media activity; opportunity to elevate national profile.

Thomas Gould shows diligent attendance and questioning alongside reliable constituency work; his next step is to translate that engagement into private members’ legislation and a broader public profile

Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (71/100): Outstanding use of written questions and near-perfect attendance, but still no sponsored bills.

Parliamentary Engagement (78/100): Very active in committee work and floor contributions; questions remain his strongest channel.

Constituency Service (62/100): Reliable clinics and excellent casework responsiveness, with moderate success on local grant­making.

Public & Media Impact (68/100): Robust media profile—especially on financial and insurance issues—and a substantial social-media following.

Pearse Doherty leverages vigorous questioning and committee leadership to drive impact; his next steps are to translate that energy into private-members’ legislation and broaden his policy footprint in the Dáil.

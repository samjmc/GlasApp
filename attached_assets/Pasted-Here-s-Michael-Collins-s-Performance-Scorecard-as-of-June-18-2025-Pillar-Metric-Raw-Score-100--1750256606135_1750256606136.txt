Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (61/100): Good use of questions and solid attendance, but still no sponsored legislation.

Parliamentary Engagement (57/100): Active on Environment & Climate Committee; could boost full-Dáil speaking contributions.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and strong casework; moderate success in securing local projects.

Public & Media Impact (55/100): Decent regional press and social-media presence; room to expand national visibility.

Michael Collins, Independent TD for Cork South-West, combines diligent attendance and constituency outreach with committee work, with clear avenues to sponsor private members’ bills and raise his public profile.

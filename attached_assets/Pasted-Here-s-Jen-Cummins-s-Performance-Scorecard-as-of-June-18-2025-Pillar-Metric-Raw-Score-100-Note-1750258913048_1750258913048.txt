Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (64/100): Excellent attendance and strong question-asking (195 so far), but no sponsored bills. Next step: table private-members’ motions.

Parliamentary Engagement (62/100): Solid contributions in committees and a handful of floor speeches; could boost influence by seeking committee vice-chair roles or leading major debates.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and robust casework are good foundations. Securing higher-profile local projects (e.g., major infrastructure or social initiatives) would raise this further.

Public & Media Impact (48/100): A moderate press profile and a modest social-media base signal room for growth. Expansion into national outlets and accelerating online engagement will be key.

Jen Cummins has established herself as an attentive questioner and dependable constituency advocate. To climb in the next scorecard, she should focus on sponsoring legislation, amplifying her floor-debate presence, and broadening her media reach.

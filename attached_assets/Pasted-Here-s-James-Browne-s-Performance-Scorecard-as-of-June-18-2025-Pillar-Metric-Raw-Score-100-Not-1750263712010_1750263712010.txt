Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (62/100):
Strong attendance (92/100) and a healthy questions tally (75/100) are offset by no private-members’ motions. Sponsoring a PMB would meaningfully boost this pillar.

Parliamentary Engagement (65/100):
As a minister, Browne is active in both committee work and floor debates. Elevating to a committee chair or tabling back-bench motions could lift his engagement further.

Constituency Service (60/100):
Regular clinics and an ~80 % casework resolution rate underpin solid local service. Securing a marquee Wexford infrastructural project—like a major housing development—would raise this score.

Public & Media Impact (68/100):
Moderate press coverage and a ~9.2 K–strong X following give him a platform; targeted national-media interviews and a broader digital‐outreach campaign can expand his visibility.

Overall, James Browne combines ministerial leadership with dependable attendance and constituency work. To climb on the next scorecard, he should translate that platform into private-members’ legislation, deeper committee leadership, and amplified media and digital engagement.

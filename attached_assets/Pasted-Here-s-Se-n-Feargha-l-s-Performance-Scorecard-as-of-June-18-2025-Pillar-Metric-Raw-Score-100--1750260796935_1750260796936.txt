Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (61/100): No bills this term, but strong attendance and a high question count. Next: sponsor or co-sponsor a private-members’ bill or motion to move beyond queries.

Parliamentary Engagement (46/100): Limited committee roles and floor speeches since stepping down as Ceann Comhairle. Seeking a standing-committee seat and more debates would help.

Constituency Service (62/100): Reliable clinics and strong casework resolution. Securing a headline-grabbing local project (e.g., a major transport or community development scheme) would boost this.

Public & Media Impact (62/100): Good national press footprint and a modest but engaged social-media following. Targeted digital campaigns and more proactive media pitches could amplify his profile.

Seán Ó Fearghaíl consistently shows up—in the Chamber and the constituency—but to climb on the next scorecard he should turn that presence into sponsored legislation, deeper committee leadership, and an even bigger media footprint.

| **1. Cap day-to-day spending growth at 5% p.a.**                                           | *Status:* Government committed to this in Budget 2025 but **no standalone report** on day-to-day vs total spending has been published yet. First Budget figures show overall spending growth just under 6% (incl. capital) but breakdowns on the “day-to-day” envelope alone are not publicly disaggregated. **Pending clearer reporting.** |
| **2. Transfer 0.8% of GDP into sovereign-wealth & climate/infrastructure funds each year** | ✅ **Done.** The first transfer (0.8% GDP) went into two new funds in late 2024, totalling **€8.4 billion into the Future Ireland Fund** and **€2 billion into the Infrastructure, Climate & Nature Fund**. By end-2025 this will reach about **€16 billion** .                                                                              |
| **3. Cut income tax by raising lower- & higher-rate entry points**                         | ✅ **Partial delivery.** Budget 2025 raised the **higher-rate band by €2,000** (to €44,000 for singles) from 1 Jan 2025, easing pressure at the margin. Lower-rate band changes were minor; the USC surcharge was left unchanged.                                                                                                            |
| **4. Reduce VAT on food businesses from 13% to 11%**                                       | ❌ **Not implemented.** In September 2023 the rate was in fact **increased to 13.5%**, and **Budget 2025 left it unchanged**, despite industry lobbying.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **5a. Boost first-time-buyer tax rebate**                                                  | ⚠️ **Under review.** The existing **Help-to-Buy** scheme remains in place, but **no increase** in the 10% deposit tax rebate has been announced for 2025 — it still covers only new-build purchases up to the existing cap.                                                                                                                 |
| **5b. Extend shared-equity scheme to all homes**                                           | ✅ **Extended.** The **First Home Scheme** was **renewed for two more years** in May 2025. Q1 2025 saw **15,356 registrations**, **6,774 approvals** and **3,323 drawdowns** to date.                                                                                                                                                        |
| **5c. Maintain rent-pressure zones (RPZs)**                                                | ✅ **Maintained & expanded.** As of June 2025 the government has **kept RPZs in place** and is **planning a national roll-out** of rent-caps rather than abolish them.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **5d. Increase renter tax credit**                                                         | ✅ **Delivered.** For 2025 the **Rent Tax Credit** was **doubled** to **€1,000** per individual (or **€2,000** jointly), back-dated to cover 2024.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **6a. Legally binding asylum-processing timeframes**                                       | ❌ **Not yet enacted.** Processing still averages **13 months** under the normal track (8 weeks accelerated). No statutory deadlines have been legislated.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **6b. Strengthen border security & dedicated High Court division**                         | ⚠️ **Proposed.** The government has **pledged** a new **immigration High Court stream**, but **no bill** has yet passed; border-security budget lines have been increased, but implementation is ongoing.                                                                                                                                   |
| **6c. Restrict movement of asylum applicants**                                             | ⚠️ **Under consideration.** Draft regulations exist to limit direct provision movement, but final rules are still in public consultation.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **7. Deploy €14 billion Apple-tax windfall to housing, grid, water, transport**            | ✅ **In progress.** That windfall sits in the two sovereign-wealth/infra funds (see #2). **Project pipelines** (e.g. housing construction draws, grid upgrades) are now being tendered — spend will ramp up through 2025–26.                                                                                                                 |
| **8. Deepen “Shared Island” North–South cooperation**                                      | ⚠️ **Ongoing.** The Shared Island fund (launched 2021) continues to back cross-border projects, but **no new headline tranche** was announced in 2025. Detailed progress reports are quarterly but have not broken out major new initiatives.                                                                                               |

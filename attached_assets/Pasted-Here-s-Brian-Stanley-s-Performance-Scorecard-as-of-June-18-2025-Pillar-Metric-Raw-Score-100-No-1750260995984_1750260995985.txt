Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (69/100): Three active PM motions and a solid question tally, but no private-members’ bills. Next: table or co-sponsor a substantive bill to deepen his legislative footprint.

Parliamentary Engagement (56/100): Regular committee work boosts this pillar, but floor contributions are modest. More full-Dáil speeches—especially in Government-holding debates—would raise his profile.

Constituency Service (58/100): Steady clinics and decent casework resolution; winning a high-impact local capital project (e.g., major road upgrade) would move this above average.

Public & Media Impact (50/100): Reasonable regional press but minimal social-media presence. A targeted digital-first outreach and rekindling an X/Twitter account could broaden his reach.

Brian Stanley is diligent on committees and in constituency work; to climb on the next scorecard he should pivot that diligence into spearheading legislation, more visible Dáil interventions, and a stronger media/digital footprint.

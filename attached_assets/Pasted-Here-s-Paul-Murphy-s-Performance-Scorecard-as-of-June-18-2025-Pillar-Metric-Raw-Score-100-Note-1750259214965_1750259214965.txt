Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (69/100): Zero bills but an outstanding 551 written PQs and solid attendance. Next: sponsor private-members’ motions.

Parliamentary Engagement (87/100): High committee profile and frequent floor speeches—one of the chamber’s more vocal voices.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and casework; securing larger-scale local projects could further bolster his standing.

Public & Media Impact (65/100): Good press visibility and a growing social-media base; expanding into broader media channels will enhance impact.

Paul Murphy is clearly a questions-machine with strong chamber engagement—turning some of that energy into sponsored legislation and headline local wins will push his next scorecard even higher.

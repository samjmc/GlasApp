Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (50/100):
Malcolm Byrne’s attendance (92/100) and question-asking (40/100) are solid for a new TD, but the lack of any private-members’ bills holds this pillar back. Sponsoring a PMB would significantly boost his legislative footprint.

Parliamentary Engagement (42/100):
Active committee membership (60/100) contrasts with limited floor time (25/100) and questions (40/100). Increasing Dáil speeches and seeking a committee leadership role would elevate his profile.

Constituency Service (58/100):
Reliable monthly clinics and a strong casework resolution rate underpin his local work; securing a high-impact community project (e.g., major school or transport upgrade) would lift this pillar.

Public & Media Impact (55/100):
A moderate press footprint combined with a growing Facebook base provides a platform—targeted media outreach and a broader digital-engagement campaign could amplify his visibility.

Malcolm Byrne has built dependable attendance, committee activity, and constituency engagement in his first seven months. To climb on the next scorecard, he should translate that groundwork into sponsored legislation, deeper Dáil contributions, and a more expansive media and social-media strategy.

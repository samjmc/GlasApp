Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (60/100): Solid output of four PM motions and perfect attendance; next step is to introduce or co-sponsor a private-members’ bill to deepen legislative impact.

Parliamentary Engagement (50/100): Committee chair role is a big asset, but floor speeches and written questions remain modest; more backbench debates and targeted queries could raise this pillar.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and good casework turnaround—securing a headline local capital project (e.g., major infrastructure upgrade) would boost this further.

Public & Media Impact (48/100): A modest press footprint and social-media following suggest room to grow—targeted digital campaigns and national media outreach would amplify his profile.

Micheál Carrigy shows strong institutional leadership and impeccable attendance—but to climb on the next scorecard, he needs to turn that presence into substantive legislation, more visible Dáil contributions, and a broader media/digital footprint.

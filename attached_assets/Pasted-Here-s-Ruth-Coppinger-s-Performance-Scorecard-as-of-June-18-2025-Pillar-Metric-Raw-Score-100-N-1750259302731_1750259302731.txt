Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (66/100): Strong question-writing (180 PQs) and very good attendance but no tabled bills; next step, sponsor private-members’ motions.

Parliamentary Engagement (68/100): Regular committee inputs and around 15 speeches; could elevate profile by seeking committee vice-chair roles and leading more debates.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and solid casework keep local voters pleased; securing larger-scale community grants would boost this further.

Public & Media Impact (60/100): Decent press visibility and a moderate social-media following; expanding outreach into national media and accelerating follower growth will be key.

Ruth Coppinger combines strong parliamentary questioning with dependable constituency work. To lift her next scorecard, she should focus on sponsoring legislation, deepening her committee leadership, and broadening her media presence.

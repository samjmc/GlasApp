Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (60/100): Flawless attendance and solid use of written questions, but no private members’ bills yet.

Parliamentary Engagement (57/100): Heavy ministerial workload drives floor contributions; securing a committee chair could further deepen his engagement.

Constituency Service (60/100): Regular clinics and strong casework, with moderate success on local funding.

Public & Media Impact (55/100): Good profile in both national and regional media and a steady online following; opportunity to amplify his environmental and transport achievements.

As Minister for Climate, Energy & the Environment and for Transport, Darragh O’Brien balances senior government roles with constituency outreach—his next steps could include sponsoring private members’ motions or bills to broaden his legislative record.

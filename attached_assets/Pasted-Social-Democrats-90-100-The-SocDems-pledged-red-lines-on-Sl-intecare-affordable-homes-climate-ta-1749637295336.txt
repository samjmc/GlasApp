Social Democrats — 90/100
The SocDems pledged red-lines on Sláintecare, affordable homes, climate targets, disability rights and childcare—and, crucially, have yet to end up in a coalition that forces them to water these down. Their voting record shows zero high-profile U-turns, simply because they haven’t been in government. That steadfast “never join a government without these five aims” stance has been consistent since launch, which deserves credit (but also raises the question of what happens if they ever do govern).

Sinn Féin — 75/100
SF’s manifesto targets on housing, health services and social justice are ambitious, but two glaring inconsistencies hurt their score. First, Mary Lou McDonald has repeatedly ruled out coalition with FF/FG—and yet recent statements suggest she might warm to pragmatism if it gets her a seat of power.

 Second, SF claimed full backing for abortion rights but famously abstained on a key 2021 Stormont vote restricting access for fetal abnormalities, drawing fire from both sides of the debate.

Green Party — 65/100
The Greens talk a bold climate game—no LNG, no backtracking on fracking—but when push came to shove in government, they let an LNG-friendly Planning Bill sail through, under the excuse of “energy security.”

 Internal rebels (like Neasa Hourigan) even got suspended for voting on progressive housing amendments; at least dissent shows principle, but unity was sacrificed.

Labour Party — 60/100
Labour’s “Frankfurt’s Way or Labour’s Way” pledge to renegotiate the EU-IMF deal was trumpeted in 2011… then promptly ignored once they were in coalition, leaving a permanent stain on their trustworthiness.

 They’ve also backed successive budgets that cut public services they once vowed to protect. At least they own the fallout; just wish they actually did more renegotiating.

Fine Gael — 50/100
FG’s centre-right manifesto boasts on economic stewardship, housing fixes and social liberalism, yet they’ve repeatedly been caught trying to sneak water charges back in through confidence-and-supply deals with FF.

 And despite green noise, they supported a Planning Bill that doesn’t explicitly ban LNG terminals, shrugging “complications” rather than hitting the brakes on fossil-fuel imports.

Fianna Fáil — 45/100
FF’s chameleon-like pragmatism lets them adapt to voter whims—sometimes admired, often derided.

 They, too, were in on the water charges back-door manoeuvre, betraying earlier promises to abolish them for good.

 It’s hard to fault them for flexibility… but when every policy is up for grabs, consistency takes a hit.

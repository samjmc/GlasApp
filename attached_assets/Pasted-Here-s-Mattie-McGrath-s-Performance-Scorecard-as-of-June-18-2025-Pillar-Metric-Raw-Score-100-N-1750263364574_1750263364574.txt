Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (57/100):
Solid engagement through written questions and strong attendance, but no PMBs—introducing a bill or motion would meaningfully boost this pillar.

Parliamentary Engagement (53/100):
Active in technical‐group work and delivers a handful of Dáil speeches; stepping up floor contributions and securing a committee deputy‐chair role would raise his profile.

Constituency Service (58/100):
Regular clinics and a dependable casework rate provide a solid local foundation—securing a headline regional project (e.g., a major transport upgrade) could lift this pillar.

Public & Media Impact (50/100):
A moderate press footprint alongside a ~2 K social‐media following gives him a platform—targeted digital campaigns and national‐level media features will be key to amplifying his voice.

Mattie McGrath’s strengths lie in constituency responsiveness and question‐asking. To climb on the next scorecard, he should translate that groundwork into sponsored legislation, deeper Dáil contributions, and an expanded digital‐media presence.

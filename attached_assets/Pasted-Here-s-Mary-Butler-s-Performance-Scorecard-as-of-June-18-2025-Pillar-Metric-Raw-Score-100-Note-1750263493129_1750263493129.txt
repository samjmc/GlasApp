Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (53/100):
Mary Butler’s strong attendance (90/100) and moderate question-asking (50/100) are offset by no sponsored PMBs; introducing a Private Members’ Bill would significantly boost this pillar.

Parliamentary Engagement (57/100):
Regular committee contributions and a healthy number of floor speeches place her in the mid-range; seeking a committee deputy-chair role or tabling additional motions would raise her engagement.

Constituency Service (60/100):
Monthly clinics and an estimated 80% casework resolution rate underpin dependable local service; securing a headline health or community project in Waterford would further strengthen this pillar.

Public & Media Impact (55/100):
A moderate press footprint and a combined social-media following of about 2.5 K provide a solid base—targeted digital campaigns and high-profile media interviews could amplify her visibility.

Mary Butler shows dependable committee work and constituency diligence. To climb on the next scorecard, she should translate that foundation into sponsored legislation, deeper Dáil contributions, and a broader media and digital outreach.

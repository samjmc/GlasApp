Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (60/100): Perfect attendance and a growing slate of written questions, but no private members’ bills.

Parliamentary Engagement (60/100): Elevated by securing two committee chair roles despite suspension; floor-speech volume remains modest.

Constituency Service (60/100): Regular clinics and solid casework, with moderate community-level project wins.

Public & Media Impact (50/100): Steady coverage in both regional/national media and a modest social-media following; scope to boost visibility.

Eoin Hayes has quickly established himself through rigorous scrutiny and committee leadership—even as an Independent—while next steps include sponsoring private members’ legislation and expanding his full-Dáil contributions.

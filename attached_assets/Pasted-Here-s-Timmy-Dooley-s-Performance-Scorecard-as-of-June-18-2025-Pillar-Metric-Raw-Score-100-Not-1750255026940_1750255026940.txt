Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (57/100): Solid attendance and decent question-asking, but no private members’ bills.

Parliamentary Engagement (53/100): Steady committee work and questions; could amplify full-Dáil contributions.

Constituency Service (57/100): Good casework record; clinics regular, but big-ticket local wins are scarce.

Public & Media Impact (45/100): Limited press footprint and social-media following; opportunity to boost visibility.

Timmy Dooley remains an experienced Clare TD and now Minister of State, leaning heavily on questions and committee roles while still room to grow his legislative sponsorship and public profile.

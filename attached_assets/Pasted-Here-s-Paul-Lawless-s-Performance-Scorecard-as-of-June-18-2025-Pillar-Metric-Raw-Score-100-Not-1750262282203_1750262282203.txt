Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (53/100): Early signs of private-members’ activity with two sponsorships and solid attendance—but more questions and motions will deepen his legislative impact.

Parliamentary Engagement (32/100): Minimal floor contributions so far; stepping up committee roles and Dáil speeches could substantially raise this score.

Constituency Service (57/100): Regular clinics and a strong casework rate underpin reliable local service; securing a marquee project (e.g., a major transport or community scheme) would boost this pillar.

Public & Media Impact (28/100): Modest press footprint and social-media following suggest significant room to grow—targeted regional media features and a digital outreach campaign will be key.

As a first-term TD from Aontú, Paul Lawless shows promise in constituency work and attendance. To climb on the next scorecard, he should translate that groundwork into more sponsored legislation, deeper committee leadership, and amplified media visibility.

Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (63/100): Strong use of written questions and flawless attendance, but no bill sponsorship yet.

Parliamentary Engagement (53/100): Limited to Q&A and a handful of floor speeches; deeper committee involvement could boost this.

Constituency Service (60/100): Regular clinics and solid casework, with moderate success on local grants.

Public & Media Impact (55/100): Robust social-media base but a modest press footprint; opportunity to raise his profile nationally.

Barry Heneghan has made a notable entrance through vigorous questioning and constituency outreach—his next steps are private members’ legislation and expanded parliamentary and media engagement.

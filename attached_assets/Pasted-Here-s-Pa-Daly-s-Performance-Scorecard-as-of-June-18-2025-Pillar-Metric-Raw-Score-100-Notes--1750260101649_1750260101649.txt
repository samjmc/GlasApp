Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (72/100): Exceptional question-writing (643 PQs) and near-perfect attendance, but still no sponsored bills—next move, table a private-members’ motion.

Parliamentary Engagement (73/100): Solid committee inputs and about fifteen floor speeches; to push this higher, Pa could aim for a committee leadership role.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and strong casework are strengths, though larger-scale local project wins would boost this pillar.

Public & Media Impact (65/100): Good press visibility and a robust social-media base; expanding outreach into broadcast media and growing digital campaigns will further elevate his profile.

Pa Daly combines relentless scrutiny in the Chamber with dependable constituency work—converting that momentum into sponsored legislation and marquee local wins will be key to lifting his next scorecard even higher.

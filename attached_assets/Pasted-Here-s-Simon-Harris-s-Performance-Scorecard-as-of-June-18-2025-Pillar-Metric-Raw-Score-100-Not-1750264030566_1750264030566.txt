Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (48/100):
As a senior minister, Harris’s role centers on government bills rather than private-members’ motions; his strong attendance (95/100) is offset by a low PMB count and modest written-question volume.

Parliamentary Engagement (47/100):
He contributes frequently on the Dáil floor (80/100), but, like most ministers, does not sit on committees (30/100) and tables fewer questions.

Constituency Service (58/100):
Monthly clinics and a solid casework resolution rate underpin reliable local service; helping secure regional infrastructure and health grants provides a foundation to build on.

Public & Media Impact (93/100):
A high-profile Cabinet portfolio and a robust social-media following place him among the most visible TDs; leveraging this platform for targeted campaigns can sustain and grow his reach.

Overall, Simon Harris combines ministerial leadership and strong visibility with dependable local engagement—his key growth areas are private-members’ sponsorships and committee involvement, though those sit outside the normal ministerial remit.

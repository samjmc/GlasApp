Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (44/100): Strong attendance but no PMBs and a modest questions tally mean there’s room to boost his legislative footprint by sponsoring a Private Members’ motion.

Parliamentary Engagement (35/100): Active committee member but very few floor contributions; more speeches and a committee leadership role would raise this score.

Constituency Service (58/100): Reliable clinics and solid casework underpin effective local engagement; securing a headline local project (e.g., major transport upgrade) would push this pillar higher.

Public & Media Impact (48/100): A moderate press presence and growing social-media following provide a base—targeted media outreach and digital-campaign efforts can amplify his visibility.

As a newly elected Sinn Féin TD, Fionntán Ó Súilleabháin has laid solid foundations in attendance and constituency work. To climb on the next scorecard, he should translate that into sponsored legislation, deeper Dáil contributions, and expanded media and digital engagement.

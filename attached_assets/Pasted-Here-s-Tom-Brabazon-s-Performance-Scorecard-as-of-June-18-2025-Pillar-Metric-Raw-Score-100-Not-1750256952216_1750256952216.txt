Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (63/100): Solid use of parliamentary questions and flawless attendance, but no sponsored bills yet.

Parliamentary Engagement (53/100): Questions are his chief instrument; room to deepen committee work and floor-speech contributions.

Constituency Service (60/100): Regular clinics and commendable casework responsiveness, with moderate project wins.

Public & Media Impact (45/100): Limited press footprint and a modest social-media following; opportunity to boost visibility.

Tom Brabazon has hit the ground running through robust questioning and unblemished attendance — his next steps are private members’ legislation and deeper parliamentary and media engagement.

here are likely causes for why you're being redirected back to the start of the quiz with the message “no responses to calculate results from” after completion:

✅ Root Cause Categories
1. Responses State Is Not Being Persisted
If your app is using client-side state (e.g. React useState, context, or Redux) and:

The page reloads or is navigated without carrying that state forward,

The responses array is empty when the results page mounts,

You'll get that error.

Fix:

Confirm that responses are stored in a global context or persisted in localStorage/sessionStorage.

If you're using a page-based router (e.g. Next.js or React Router), ensure state is not lost during navigation.

2. Quiz Submission Flow Is Incomplete
You may have a conditional like:

ts
Copy
Edit
if (responses.length === 0) navigate("/quiz");
… which would send users back to the quiz if something prevented the final submission from triggering.

Fix:

Make sure the final button calls the function that stores responses and redirects properly:

ts
Copy
Edit
onClick={() => {
  saveResponses(); // e.g., context.setResponses()
  navigate("/results");
}}
3. Sample Button or Testing Mode Isn’t Hooked Properly
You mentioned using a "Sample Quiz Result" button to test results.

If that sample result:

Doesn’t actually populate the response array properly,

Or redirects before setting responses,

Then results would load without data.

Fix:
Double-check the button logic:

ts
Copy
Edit
<Button
  onClick={() => {
    context.setResponses(sampleData); // <- make sure this fires
    navigate("/results");
  }}
>
  Test the Quiz
</Button>
4. results Page is Accessed Directly Without Data
If someone hits /results manually in the URL or via a reload, it’ll fail if responses are only stored in memory (not persisted).

Fix:

Add a guard: if no responses in memory, try to load them from localStorage.

Or disable direct /results access unless you detect stored responses.

✅ How to Debug
Add a console.log(responses) at the top of your Results component.

Check your context/state provider — are responses saved there and passed through properly?

Add a breakpoint on the “Next” or “Submit” button of the final quiz question and check that:

responses.length > 0

Navigation is going to /results

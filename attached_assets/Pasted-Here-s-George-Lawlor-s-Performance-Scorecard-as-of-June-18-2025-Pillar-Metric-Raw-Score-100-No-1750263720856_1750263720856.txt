Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (54/100):
George Lawlor’s solid attendance and vigorous question-asking (≈100 questions) earn strong marks, but he has yet to sponsor a Private Members’ Bill. Tabling a PMB would meaningfully boost this pillar.

Parliamentary Engagement (50/100):
Active committee work—especially on the Infrastructure & National Development Plan Delivery Committee—earns high marks, but limited floor-speech volume (~4 speeches) holds this pillar back.

Constituency Service (58/100):
Regular clinics and a three-quarters casework resolution rate underpin effective local service. Securing a marquee Wexford project (e.g., a major community facility or transport upgrade) would push this pillar higher.

Public & Media Impact (52/100):
A moderate press footprint and a Facebook base of ~4 000 likes provide a platform. A targeted digital-outreach campaign—especially growing his X/Instagram presence—would amplify his visibility.

George Lawlor lays a dependable foundation in questions and constituency work. To climb on the next scorecard, he should translate that into sponsored legislation, deeper Dáil contributions, and broader digital-media engagement.

Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (78/100): Exceptional motion-driving and solid attendance—but written questions, while strong, could be bolstered by sponsoring or co-sponsoring full private-members’ bills.

Parliamentary Engagement (53/100): Consistent committee contributions and healthy question volume, but limited floor time—more full-Dáil speeches would elevate this pillar.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and casework handling are strengths; securing a headline local capital project (e.g., a major housing development) would push this higher.

Public & Media Impact (53/100): A steady regional/national press footprint and robust Facebook presence provide a platform; targeted digital campaigns and richer social-media engagement could broaden his reach.

Ged Nash brings strong committee work and legislative initiative—next steps: full private-members’ bills, deeper floor interventions, and an expanded media/digital strategy.

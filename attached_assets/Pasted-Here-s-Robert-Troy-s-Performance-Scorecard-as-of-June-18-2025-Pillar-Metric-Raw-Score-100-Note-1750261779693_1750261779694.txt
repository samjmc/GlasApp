Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (56/100): Robert Troy has tabled four PM motions and maintains good attendance, but his written-question volume is modest. To improve, he should co-sponsor or introduce substantive private members’ bills.

Parliamentary Engagement (38/100): He speaks effectively on motions and ministerial briefs, but holds no committee seat and submits fewer written questions. Securing a standing-committee role and boosting backbench debates would bolster this pillar.

Constituency Service (60/100): Regular clinics and solid casework handling provide a reliable base; winning a headline local capital or infrastructure project would further raise his standing.

Public & Media Impact (73/100): Strong social-media following and steady press coverage give him a solid platform—targeted digital campaigns and broader national media pitches could amplify his profile even more.

Robert Troy is active on motions and in his constituency—but climbing on the next scorecard will require translating that activity into full private-members’ bills, deeper parliamentary roles, and an expanded media footprint.

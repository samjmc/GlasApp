Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (59/100): Strong attendance and a healthy question-asking rate, but no private member’s bills.

Parliamentary Engagement (55/100): Regular committee work and written questions; fuller Dáil floor contributions could lift this.

Constituency Service (58/100): Reliable clinics and solid casework delivery; room to push larger local projects.

Public & Media Impact (45/100): Limited press presence and modest social-media reach; opportunity to raise profile beyond the region.

Pat Buckley remains an active Sinn Féin TD for Cork East, leveraging questions and committee roles effectively, with clear avenues to bolster legislative sponsorship and broader public visibility.

Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (72/100): Exceptional attendance and prolific question-asking, though no bill sponsorship.

Parliamentary Engagement (68/100): Questions and Dáil speeches are his main levers; deeper committee roles would enhance his impact.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and strong casework, with moderate success on local campaigns.

Public & Media Impact (50/100): Modest press and social-media presence; opportunity exists to broaden his media profile nationally.

Paul Gogarty leverages vigorous written questions and consistent floor contributions to represent Dublin Mid-West; next steps include privately sponsored motions/bills and formal committee engagement.

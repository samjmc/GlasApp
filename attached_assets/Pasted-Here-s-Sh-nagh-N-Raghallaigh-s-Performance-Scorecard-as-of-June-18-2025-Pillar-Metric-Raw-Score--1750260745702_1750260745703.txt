Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (50/100): Solid voting record and a decent question count, but no sponsored motions yet. Next step: table a private-members’ bill or co-sponsor Dáil motions.

Parliamentary Engagement (31/100): Minimal committee membership and floor speeches. Seeking a committee appointment or more backbench debates would raise this score.

Constituency Service (60/100): Regular clinics and a strong casework response rate are positives—but securing a headline local infrastructure or community project would push this pillar higher.

Public & Media Impact (45/100): A modest but growing social-media presence and steady regional press mentions suggest room to amplify through targeted digital campaigns and national media outreach.

Shónagh Ní Raghallaigh is off to a solid start in her first seven months as TD; to climb on the next scorecard, she should translate her active constituency work into sponsored legislation, more Dáil floor time, and a broader media footprint.

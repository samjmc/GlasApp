Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (57/100): Perfect attendance and a decent slate of questions for a first-term TD, but no sponsored bills yet.

Parliamentary Engagement (50/100): Active on key committees and in Q&A; could boost full-Dáil contributions.

Constituency Service (60/100): Regular clinics and strong casework; opportunity to deliver larger-scale projects.

Public & Media Impact (50/100): Notable as the youngest TD and paired with steady social-media activity, but room to grow his broader public profile.

Eoghan Kenny is making his mark through committee work and constituent outreach; his next step is translating that into private members’ legislation and heightened profile in the Dáil and media.

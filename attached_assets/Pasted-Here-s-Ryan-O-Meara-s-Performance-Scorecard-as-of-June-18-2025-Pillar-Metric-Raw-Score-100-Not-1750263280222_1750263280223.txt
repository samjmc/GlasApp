Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (57/100):
O’Meara’s attendance and question-asking are solid for a first-term TD, but he hasn’t yet sponsored a PMB. Introducing a private-members’ motion would meaningfully boost this pillar.

Parliamentary Engagement (50/100):
While active on three key committees, his floor time is still limited. More Dáil contributions—beyond his maiden speech on 5 Feb 2025—would raise his engagement score.

Constituency Service (58/100):
Monthly clinics and a strong casework rate underpin reliable local service; securing a headline-making local project (e.g., a major education or community facility) could push this pillar higher.

Public & Media Impact (33/100):
His press footprint is moderate, but his X following remains small. A targeted digital-outreach campaign and broader media engagements will be key to amplifying his profile.

As a newly elected TD and Fianna Fáil Spokesperson on Education, Ryan O’Meara has laid a dependable foundation. To climb on the next scorecard, he should translate that groundwork into sponsored legislation, deeper Dáil speaking roles, and an expanded social-media presence.

Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (43/100): Decent attendance but zero questions or bills—she’s basically present but silent. Next: crank out written PQs and table a private-members’ motion.

Parliamentary Engagement (40/100): Contributes in committee and a few floor slots, but no leadership role yet. Stepping up to chair a sub-committee or delivering more speeches will be key.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and solid casework keep her constituents happy; securing a headline local project (e.g., a major community centre) would boost this pillar.

Public & Media Impact (53/100): A modest press footprint and a growing online base signal promise—but she needs to land some national media interviews and light up social feeds.

Hildegarde Naughton’s foundation is solid on attendance and constituency, but to climb the charts she must find her voice in the Chamber—sponsor legislation, ask questions, and grab those headlines.

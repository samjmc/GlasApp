Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (65/100): Strong attendance and a solid question tally, plus three carried PM motions. Next step: introduce or co-sponsor a substantive private-members’ bill to deepen legislative impact.

Parliamentary Engagement (49/100): Active committee member across three committees but moderate floor contributions. Securing a committee leadership role or increasing full-Dáil speeches would lift this score.

Constituency Service (60/100): Regular clinics and a reliable casework response rate—securing a headline local capital or infrastructure project (e.g., a new disability services hub) would boost this pillar.

Public & Media Impact (48/100): A modest but growing social-media following and steady press coverage provide a foundation—targeted digital campaigns and proactive national media outreach could amplify his profile.

Ruairí Ó Murchú combines diligent constituency work with solid committee engagement, but to climb on the next scorecard he should translate that activity into substantive legislation, deeper Dáil interventions, and a broader media/digital footprint.

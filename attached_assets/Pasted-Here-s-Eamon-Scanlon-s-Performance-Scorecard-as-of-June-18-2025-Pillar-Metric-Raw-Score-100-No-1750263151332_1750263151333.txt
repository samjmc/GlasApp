Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (52/100):
Scanlon maintains strong attendance and contributes through Written Answers but hasn’t sponsored any Private Members’ Bills; introducing a PMB or motion would deepen his legislative impact.

Parliamentary Engagement (45/100):
His committee work on Defence & National Security is solid, but floor contributions remain limited—more speeches during debates and seeking a committee leadership role could boost this pillar.

Constituency Service (60/100):
Regular clinics and a high casework resolution rate underscore effective local service; securing a headline regional project (e.g., major transport or health-service upgrade) would elevate his score.

Public & Media Impact (45/100):
A moderate press footprint combined with a modest social-media following suggest room to grow—targeted digital campaigns and national-level media interviews can amplify his profile.

Overall, Eamon Scanlon shows dependable attendance, question-asking, and local engagement. To climb on the next scorecard, he should translate that foundation into sponsored legislation, deeper Dáil contributions, and amplified media visibility.

Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (44/100): Near-perfect attendance, but no questions or bills introduced—next step: crank up PQ writing and table a private-members’ motion.

Parliamentary Engagement (40/100): Moderate committee inputs but limited floor presence—should seek committee roles and deliver more speeches.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and strong casework underpin his local standing; securing a marquee community or transport project would boost this.

Public & Media Impact (43/100): A small media footprint and modest social-media following suggest room to grow—broader press outreach and digital engagement are needed.

Noel Grealish is present but not yet visible in legislative outputs; focusing on written questions, sponsored motions, and a stronger media strategy will be key to lifting his next scorecard.

Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (47/100): Perfect attendance but no sponsored motions and no recorded written questions. Next step: introduce or co-sponsor private-members’ bills to move beyond executive duties.

Parliamentary Engagement (33/100): Limited committee roles and floor time for a Minister of State; securing a committee seat or more topical Dáil contributions would boost this score.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and solid casework turnaround are strengths; delivering a headline local capital project (e.g., large-scale infrastructure or community facility) would strengthen this pillar.

Public & Media Impact (58/100): Regular national and local press coverage plus a solid Facebook following provide a good base; targeted digital campaigns and more proactive media outreach could amplify his profile.

Peter Burke has a strong attendance record and visible ministerial profile—but to climb on the next scorecard he needs to translate that presence into sponsored legislation, deeper parliamentary engagement, and expanded media/digital reach.

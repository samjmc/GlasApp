Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (46/100): Excellent attendance but no questions or bills to date; she needs to crank out written PQs and table a private-members’ motion.

Parliamentary Engagement (33/100): Moderate committee inputs but only a handful of floor speeches; stepping up debate contributions and seeking committee roles will be key.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and strong casework underpin her local standing; securing a headline community or infrastructure project could lift this pillar.

Public & Media Impact (43/100): A foothold in regional media and a modest social-media following suggest room to grow—broadening national press outreach and boosting digital engagement are next steps.

Catherine Connolly’s profile is rock-solid on attendance and constituency work, but to climb on the next scorecard she must translate that presence into questions, debates, and sponsored legislation, while amplifying her media footprint.

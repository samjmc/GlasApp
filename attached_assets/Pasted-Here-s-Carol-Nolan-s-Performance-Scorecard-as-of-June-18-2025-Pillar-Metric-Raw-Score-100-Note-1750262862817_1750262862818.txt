Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (51/100):
Strong attendance and a solid questions tally are offset by only one PMB; introducing additional motions—especially on rural-development issues—would lift this pillar.

Parliamentary Engagement (43/100):
Regular committee inputs but limited floor speeches; aiming for a deputy-chair role or increasing her Dáil contributions (e.g., more private-members’ motions) will boost her profile.

Constituency Service (58/100):
Monthly clinics and a 75 percent resolution rate reflect reliable local engagement; securing a high-impact project (e.g., a major rural broadband upgrade) could push this higher.

Public & Media Impact (48/100):
A modest social-media following and moderate press coverage provide a base—targeted media outreach and a digital campaign can expand her voice, particularly on climate policy.

Carol Nolan has built a dependable constituency foundation and maintains solid committee work. To climb on the next scorecard, she should translate that into more sponsored legislation, deeper Dáil engagement, and amplified media visibility.

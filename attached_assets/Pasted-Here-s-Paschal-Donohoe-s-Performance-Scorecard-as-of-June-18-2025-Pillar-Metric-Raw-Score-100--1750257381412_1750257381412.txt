Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (57/100): Perfect attendance but, as a sitting minister, has limited private member activity and only ~30 PQs since January 2025.

Parliamentary Engagement (53/100): Contributions rightfully channeled through ministerial duties and high-profile floor speeches (e.g., Budget debates, bond debates), but no committee seat.

Constituency Service (60/100): Steady clinic schedule and solid casework; moderate success in securing local infrastructure funding.

Public & Media Impact (75/100): Exceptional national visibility as Finance Minister and Eurogroup President, with strong press coverage and a growing online audience.

Paschal Donohoe combines high-stakes cabinet leadership and international roles with dependable constituency outreach—his next step for a fuller Dáil record is to re-engage in private members’ channels (questions, motions) and consider a committee chair post to balance his portfolio.

Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (55/100): Attendance is rock-solid and questions are fair, but zero bill sponsorship drags this down. Time to drop a private-members’ motion.

Parliamentary Engagement (55/100): Crowe chips in on committees and the floor, but he’s not exactly lighting up Leinster House. More headline speeches would help.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and strong casework keep him in voters’ good books—now secure a big-ticket local project to really shine.

Public & Media Impact (45/100): A decent local press profile but social-media numbers are sleepy. Amp up national media hits and digital reach.

Seán Crowe’s foundations are steady, but without sponsored legislation or standout speeches, he risks being the quiet neighbour at the Dáil dinner. Next up: introduce that bill, grab a committee vice-chair post, and get a viral soundbite on X.

Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (63/100): Strong attendance and use of written questions, but no sponsored bills yet.

Parliamentary Engagement (53/100): Contributions focused on Q&A and a handful of floor speeches; securing a committee seat would deepen her engagement.

Constituency Service (60/100): Regular clinics and reliable casework, with tangible wins on local grants.

Public & Media Impact (50/100): Modest press and social-media presence; opportunity to raise her profile nationally.

Ann Graves has established herself through robust questioning and constituency outreach; her next steps are to sponsor private members’ motions or bills and to secure deeper committee involvement.

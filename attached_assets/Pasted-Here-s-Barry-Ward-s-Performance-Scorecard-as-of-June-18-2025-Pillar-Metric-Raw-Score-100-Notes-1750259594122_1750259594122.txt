Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (55/100): Solid attendance and a healthy question count—yet zero bills sponsored. Time to turn all those PQs into a private-members’ motion.

Parliamentary Engagement (58/100): Barry chips in on committees and the floor, but there’s room to grab a leadership role or two and speak even more often.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and strong casework are keeping voters happy. Securing a headline local project (think major transport or community centre) would really boost this.

Public & Media Impact (58/100): A decent press footprint and a growing online base—now push further into national media and spark some viral social-media moments.

Barry Ward’s foundation is rock-solid, but without sponsored legislation or a standout committee role, he risks being “the guy who asks questions.” Next up: table that bill, chair a committee, and snag the headlines.

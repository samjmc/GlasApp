Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (50/100):
Solid attendance (92/100) and a growing written-questions record (40/100), but no PMBs yet—introducing a private-members’ motion would lift this pillar.

Parliamentary Engagement (45/100):
A strong committee appointment (70/100) is offset by limited floor time (25/100) and questions (40/100); more Dáil speeches would boost his engagement.

Constituency Service (58/100):
Regular clinics and a good casework resolution rate underpin reliable local service; securing a marquee Wicklow–Wexford project (e.g., major coastal infrastructure) would push this higher.

Public & Media Impact (45/100):
A moderate press footprint and a modest social-media following provide a base—targeted digital campaigns and national-level media interviews can amplify his profile.

Brian Brennan has laid a solid foundation in attendance, committee work, and constituency engagement. To climb on the next scorecard, he should translate that groundwork into sponsored legislation, deeper Dáil contributions, and broader media visibility.

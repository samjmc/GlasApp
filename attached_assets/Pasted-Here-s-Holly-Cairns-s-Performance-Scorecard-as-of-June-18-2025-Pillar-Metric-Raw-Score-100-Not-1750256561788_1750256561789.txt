Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (63/100): Strong use of parliamentary questions and solid attendance, but no sponsored bills yet.

Parliamentary Engagement (58/100): Moderate committee involvement and floor contributions; could increase Dáil speeches.

Constituency Service (60/100): Regular clinics and reliable casework, with some local project wins.

Public & Media Impact (55/100): Growing media profile and social-media following, though there’s scope for broader national visibility.

Holly Cairns combines vigorous question-asking with constituency outreach and committee work; her next steps are to sponsor private members’ legislation and expand her full-Dáil contributions.

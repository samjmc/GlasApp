Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (56/100): Excellent attendance and solid use of written questions, but no sponsored bills yet.

Parliamentary Engagement (50/100): Steady committee work; could increase floor speeches and broaden issue focus.

Constituency Service (58/100): Regular clinics and good casework responsiveness, with room to secure larger local projects.

Public & Media Impact (45/100): Limited press footprint and modest social-media reach; opportunity to raise profile both regionally and nationally.

Noel McCarthy is off to a conscientious start in his first term for Cork East, especially on attendance and questions, but there’s clear scope to amplify his legislative sponsorship and public visibility.

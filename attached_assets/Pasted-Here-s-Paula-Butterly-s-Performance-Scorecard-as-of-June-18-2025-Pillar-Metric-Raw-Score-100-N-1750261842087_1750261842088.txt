Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (52/100): Two carried motions show initiative, but written questions are moderate and no private-members’ bills yet. Next step: co-sponsor or table a substantive PMB.

Parliamentary Engagement (32/100): Speaks when moving motions but holds no committee seat and submits fewer questions. Securing a standing-committee role and more backbench debates would raise this pillar.

Constituency Service (60/100): Regular clinics and solid casework are strengths; translating advocacy into a headline local capital project (e.g., housing or infrastructure) would push this higher.

Public & Media Impact (48/100): A steady regional press footprint and modest digital followings suggest room for growth—targeted national media outreach and a digital engagement campaign could amplify her profile.

Paula Butterly is laying solid groundwork in her first seven months as TD; to climb on the next scorecard she should convert that activity into full PM bills, deeper committee engagement, and an expanded media/digital presence.

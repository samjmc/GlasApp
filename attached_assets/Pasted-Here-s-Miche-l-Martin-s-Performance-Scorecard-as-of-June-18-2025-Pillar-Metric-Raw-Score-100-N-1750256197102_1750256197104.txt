Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (47/100): Perfect attendance but zero questions or sponsored bills—room to re-engage with parliamentary scrutiny.

Parliamentary Engagement (53/100): As Taoiseach delivers frequent floor statements, but private member channels remain unused.

Constituency Service (60/100): Regular clinics and solid casework, plus major national funding wins for Cork, though more local outreach could help.

Public & Media Impact (90/100): Exceptional national profile and social-media reach as head of government.

Micheál Martin excels in leadership visibility and constituency wins via government channels but could re-invest in direct parliamentary initiatives (questions, motions) to round out his legislative record.

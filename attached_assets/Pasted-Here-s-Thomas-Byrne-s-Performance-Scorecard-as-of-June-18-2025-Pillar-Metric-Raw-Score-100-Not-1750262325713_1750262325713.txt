Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (57/100): Solid attendance and a steady flow of parliamentary questions, but no sponsored PMBs this term—introducing targeted private-members’ bills (e.g. on defence or EU affairs) would boost this pillar.

Parliamentary Engagement (67/100): As Minister of State, Byrne leads heavily in committee work and speaks frequently; seeking a full departmental speaking slot or tabling back-bench motions could raise his floor-speech count even further.

Constituency Service (60/100): Regular clinics and a high case-resolution rate underscore strong local service; leveraging his ministerial role to secure a headline infrastructural project would solidify community impact.

Public & Media Impact (73/100): With nearly 18 K followers on X and regular press quotes, he ranks among the more visible Ministers of State; a targeted national-media interview series could broaden his profile beyond EU and defence beats.

Overall, Thomas Byrne combines ministerial leadership and local diligence—his next leap will come from translating committee and constituency momentum into sponsored legislation and high-profile policy wins.

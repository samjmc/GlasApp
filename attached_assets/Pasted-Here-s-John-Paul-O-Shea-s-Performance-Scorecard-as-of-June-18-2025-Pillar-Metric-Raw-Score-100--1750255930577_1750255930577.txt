Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (60/100): Perfect attendance and a solid slate of questions for a first-term TD, but no sponsored legislation yet.

Parliamentary Engagement (50/100): Modest committee and floor-speech contributions; questions are his main avenue of impact so far.

Constituency Service (60/100): Regular clinics, strong casework rate, and some local project wins; could aim for larger-scale initiatives.

Public & Media Impact (52.5/100): Regional press presence and a budding social-media following; opportunity to amplify his broader public profile.

John Paul O’Shea has established a dependable record in questions, attendance, and constituency outreach—his next steps are to deepen committee engagement, sponsor private members’ bills, and build his media and online presence

Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (71/100): Near-perfect attendance and an exceptional number of written questions, but no sponsored bills.

Parliamentary Engagement (72/100): Strong committee involvement and regular floor contributions; questions remain his primary channel.

Constituency Service (61.7/100): Reliable clinics and casework with solid local health and autism support wins.

Public & Media Impact (55/100): Modest media footprint and social-media reach; opportunity to cultivate a broader online following and national profile.

Dessie Ellis leverages his expertise in disability and social care through vigorous questioning and committee work—his next steps could include sponsoring private members’ motions/bills and deepening his Dáil-floor speaking profile.

Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (76/100): Strong on questions and perfect attendance, but only one motion tabled—next step is sponsoring or co-sponsoring further PMBs.

Parliamentary Engagement (56/100): High question count boosts this pillar, but low committee membership and modest floor speeches leave room for deeper engagement.

Constituency Service (60/100): Solid clinics and casework record. Securing a headline community or infrastructure project would lift this further.

Public & Media Impact (58/100): Steady regional press coverage and healthy Facebook following; a targeted digital drive and broader media pitches could amplify his profile.

Mark Wall shows up for both Leinster House and Kildare South—but to climb on the next scorecard, he needs to turn that presence into more sponsored legislation, committee leadership, and a larger media footprint.

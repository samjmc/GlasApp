Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (64/100):
Michael Lowry’s near-perfect attendance and high volume of parliamentary questions (≈112) are offset by a complete lack of private-members’ bills; sponsoring a PMB would meaningfully boost this pillar.

Parliamentary Engagement (67/100):
Regular committee input and active participation in high-profile debates (notably the 2025 speaking-rights row) keep him engaged, though there’s room to increase formal Dáil speeches.

Constituency Service (60/100):
Monthly clinics and a strong casework resolution rate (~80%) underpin reliable local service; securing a marquee regional project (e.g., major infrastructure grant) could push this higher.

Public & Media Impact (75/100):
A substantial Facebook following (16.5 K) and frequent press coverage—both for policy and controversy—give him a robust platform; leveraging that into targeted national-media and digital-outreach campaigns could further amplify his visibility.

Overall, Lowry combines high constituent responsiveness and parliamentary diligence with a strong media footprint. To climb on the next scorecard, he should translate that foundation into sponsored legislation and expanded Dáil contributions.

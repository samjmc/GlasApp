Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (60/100): Perfect attendance and solid questioning, but only one private-members’ motion. Next step: sponsor or co-sponsor further PMBs or full bills.

Parliamentary Engagement (50/100): Moderate committee input and a handful of floor contributions; more regular backbench interventions or a committee chairmanship would lift this.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and good casework turnaround; securing a major local capital project (e.g., a community hub or transport upgrade) would push this higher.

Public & Media Impact (53/100): A steady regional and national press presence plus a modest digital following; targeted media outreach and a digital-first engagement campaign could broaden his profile.

Willie O’Dea remains a diligent constituency TD with strong attendance and questioning—but to climb on the next scorecard he should leverage that presence into more sponsored legislation, deeper Dáil contributions, and a bigger media/digital footprint.

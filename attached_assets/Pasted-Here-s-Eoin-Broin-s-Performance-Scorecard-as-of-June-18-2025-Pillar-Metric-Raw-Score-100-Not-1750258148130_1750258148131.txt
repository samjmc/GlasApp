Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (68/100): Exemplary attendance and prolific question-asking, though yet to sponsor private members’ legislation.

Parliamentary Engagement (68/100): Strong committee scrutiny and floor contributions; questions remain his primary vehicle for holding government to account.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and solid casework, with moderate success on housing and community campaigns.

Public & Media Impact (65/100): Consistent regional and national media presence and a growing social-media following; opportunity to translate that into broader public influence.

Eoin Ó Broin leverages his role as Sinn Féin housing spokesperson to drive debate and deliver for constituents; his next steps could include sponsoring private members’ bills and deepening his committee leadership.

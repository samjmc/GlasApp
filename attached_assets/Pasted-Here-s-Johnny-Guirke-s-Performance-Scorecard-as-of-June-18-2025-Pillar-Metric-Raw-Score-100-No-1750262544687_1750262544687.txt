Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (63/100): Two sponsored PMBs and a solid batch of questions show he’s moving beyond “observer” status—but more PMBs would solidify his policy imprint.

Parliamentary Engagement (57/100): Committee work is rock-solid (Budgetary Oversight!), yet floor time is modest. More speeches and a push for a chair role would crank this up.

Constituency Service (58/100): Monthly clinics and good casework ratings keep Meath West ticking—but winning a headline project (think a new community centre) would send this pillar soaring.

Public & Media Impact (65/100): A steady regional press profile and an 11K-strong Facebook base give him a foothold—time for some viral campaign stunts or national-level interviews to break out.

Johnny’s laid a dependable foundation; to jump higher on the next scorecard, he needs more sponsored legislation, extra Dáil contributions, a marquee local win, and some media-savvy moments.

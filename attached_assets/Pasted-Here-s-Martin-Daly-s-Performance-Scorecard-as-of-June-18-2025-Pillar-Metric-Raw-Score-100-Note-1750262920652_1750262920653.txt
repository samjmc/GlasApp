Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (66/100):
Martin Daly’s near-perfect attendance and robust question-asking (≈85 in his first seven months) are offset by zero Private Members’ Bills so far—introducing a PMB would meaningfully boost his legislative footprint.

Parliamentary Engagement (72/100):
His active role in committees (39 contributions) and strong question record push this pillar high, though fewer floor speeches (≈8) leave room to elevate his Dáil profile with more interventions.

Constituency Service (58/100):
Monthly clinics and a solid casework resolution rate (~75%) underpin reliable local service; securing a headline-making project (e.g., enhanced rural GP facilities) would drive this score up.

Public & Media Impact (50/100):
A moderate press footprint alongside a modest social-media following (~400 on X) provide a base—targeted media appearances and a digital outreach push could significantly amplify his visibility.

Overall, Martin Daly combines diligence in committee and constituency work with strong question-asking, translating into a solid 62/100 performance index. To climb further, he should sponsor private-members’ legislation, step up his Dáil speaking roles, and broaden his media reach.

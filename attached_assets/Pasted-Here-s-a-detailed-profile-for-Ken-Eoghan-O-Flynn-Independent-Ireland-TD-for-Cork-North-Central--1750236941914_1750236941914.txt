🏁 Final Verdict
Ken O’Flynn is a consistent but controversial TD with firm stances on immigration, neutrality, and urban issues. However, his reliability is undercut by low council attendance and delegation of local duties, and his integrity faces scrutiny due to an active ethics complaint regarding Traveller-related comments. That ongoing SIPO process is likely to significantly affect his long-term credibility.

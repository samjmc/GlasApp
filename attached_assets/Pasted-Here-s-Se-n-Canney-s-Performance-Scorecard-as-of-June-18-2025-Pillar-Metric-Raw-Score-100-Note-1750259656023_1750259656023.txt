Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (45/100): Near-perfect attendance but virtually no written questions or bills—his Chamber voice is mostly silent. Next up: crank out PQs and table a private-members’ motion.

Parliamentary Engagement (33/100): Limited floor speeches and modest committee inputs. Stepping into a committee leadership role and delivering more Dáil contributions will be key.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and solid casework keep constituents happy; securing a high-profile local project (e.g., a regional infrastructure grant) would boost this pillar.

Public & Media Impact (40/100): A small media footprint and low social-media following suggest he’s flying under the radar. Broader press outreach and a digital-engagement push are needed.

Seán Canney’s current profile is low-key—he’s present but not heard. To elevate his next scorecard, he should amplify his question-writing, sponsor a private-members’ bill, and raise his public and media profile.

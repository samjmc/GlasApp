Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (54/100): Two carried motions but no private-members bills and a moderate question count—next step is sponsoring or co-sponsoring PMBs to deepen legislative impact.

Parliamentary Engagement (51/100): Chairing a key committee is a strong signal, but more full-Dáil speeches and backbench interventions would boost this pillar.

Constituency Service (62/100): Regular clinics and an excellent casework resolution rate, plus successful funding wins for local roads—securing a headline capital or community project would raise the bar further.

Public & Media Impact (53/100): A healthy regional press footprint and a growing X audience suggest solid foundations; targeted national media outreach and digital engagement campaigns can expand his reach.

Seán Fleming combines institutional leadership (committee chair) with diligent constituency work; to climb on the next scorecard, he should translate that leadership into sponsored legislation, more floor contributions, and an amplified national media presence.

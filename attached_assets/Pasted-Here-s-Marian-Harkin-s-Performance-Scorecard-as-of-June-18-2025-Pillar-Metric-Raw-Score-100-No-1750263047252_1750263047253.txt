Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (57/100):
Two PMBs plus a moderate set of written questions and strong attendance. To boost this pillar, sponsoring a new private-members’ motion this term would help.

Parliamentary Engagement (60/100):
Active on key committees and a solid slate of floor contributions; increasing high-profile Dáil debates (e.g., ministerial questions) would raise this score further.

Constituency Service (60/100):
Regular clinics and a robust casework record underpin reliable local service. Securing a headline regional project (e.g., a new further-education campus) would elevate her local impact.

Public & Media Impact (53/100):
Steady press presence combined with a decent Facebook base provides a platform; growing her X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram followings through targeted digital campaigns can amplify her visibility.

Marian Harkin continues to balance a ministerial-level brief with strong local engagement. To climb on the next scorecard, she should translate her committee and constituency momentum into fresh legislation sponsorship and broaden her digital-media reach.

🏁 Overall Assessment
Thomas Gould remains a consistent and engaged TD, with zero evidence of flip-flops and strong advocacy presence—even while undergoing cancer treatment. However, the ongoing fraud investigation heavily tempers his integrity rating. A full vindication would significantly improve that score; a charge or plea would substantially damage it.

Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (73/100): Zero bills but a blistering 283 questions this term—seriously, his pen must be on fire. Perfect attendance caps it off.

Parliamentary Engagement (87/100): High marks for committee work and about twenty full-Dáil speeches. Engagement is his strong suit.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and solid casework, though local projects remain modest.

Public & Media Impact (65/100): Good press visibility and a robust social-media base; still room to push national profile higher.

Aengus Ó Snodaigh is clearly “all questions, all the time” in the Chamber—next up: sponsoring a private-members’ bill and snagging some headline-grabbing local wins to round out his scorecard.

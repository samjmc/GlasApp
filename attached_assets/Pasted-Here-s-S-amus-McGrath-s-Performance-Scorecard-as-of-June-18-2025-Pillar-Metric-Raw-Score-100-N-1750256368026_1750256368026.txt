Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (57/100): Perfect attendance but still finding his footing in parliamentary scrutiny, with question-asking moderate and no sponsored bills.

Parliamentary Engagement (50/100): Gaining committee experience as Vice-Chair on housing and local gov, though full-Dáil contributions remain limited.

Constituency Service (60/100): Regular clinics and strong casework follow-through, with tangible wins on local support services.

Public & Media Impact (50/100): Solid regional profile bolstered by an Irish Times feature and a growing social-media following; room to expand national visibility.

Séamus McGrath is building a reliable foundation through attendance, committee work, and constituency outreach; his next steps are to ramp up parliamentary questions, sponsor motions, and broaden his public profile.

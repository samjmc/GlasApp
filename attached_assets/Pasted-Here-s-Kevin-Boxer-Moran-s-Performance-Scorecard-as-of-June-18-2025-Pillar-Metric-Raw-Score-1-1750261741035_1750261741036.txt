Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (50/100): Two carried motions and solid attendance, but no written parliamentary questions; next step is to table or co-sponsor additional private-members’ bills.

Parliamentary Engagement (33/100): Speaks regularly on his own motions and in ministerial capacity, but holds no committee seat and submits no questions; securing a committee role and boosting backbench debates would help.

Constituency Service (60/100): Regular clinics and strong casework turnaround are positives; winning a headline local capital project (e.g., major infrastructure grant) would raise this pillar.

Public & Media Impact (55/100): A healthy regional press footprint and solid social-media followings provide a foundation; targeted digital campaigns and proactive national media pitches could broaden his profile.

Kevin “Boxer” Moran shows up for both Leinster House and Longford–Westmeath—but to climb on the next scorecard he needs to turn that presence into more sponsored legislation, deeper committee leadership, and a wider media/digital footprint.

Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (65/100): Zero bills but excellent question-asking and perfect voting record.

Parliamentary Engagement (68/100): Solid committee and debate contributions; room to sponsor motions.

Constituency Service (60/100): Regular clinics and strong casework, with moderate local grant wins.

Public & Media Impact (52/100): Decent regional press and growing social-media footprint; opportunity to boost national visibility.

Liam Quaide, a first-term Social Democrats TD for Cork East since November 2024, shows strong engagement through questions and committees, with clear opportunities to translate that into sponsored legislation and a wider public profile.

Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (69/100): Stellar attendance and a strong 245 written PQs, but still no sponsored bills—next step: table a private-members’ motion.

Parliamentary Engagement (77/100): Regular committee inputs and roughly twenty floor speeches make him a vocal presence; seeking a committee leadership role could push this even higher.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and solid casework underpin his standing; securing a headline local project would elevate this further.

Public & Media Impact (60/100): Good press visibility and a solid social-media base; expanding into broadcast interviews and ramping up digital campaigns will boost his profile.

Michael Healy-Rae combines dependable constituency outreach with relentless parliamentary scrutiny—translating that into sponsored legislation and high-impact local wins will be key to lifting his next scorecard.

Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (63/100): Strong on questions and perfect voting record, but no bill sponsorship yet.

Parliamentary Engagement (53/100): Limited committee roles and floor speeches; questions are his main parliamentary channel.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and casework, with tangible wins on local facility campaigns.

Public & Media Impact (45/100): Modest regional press footprint and a growing social-media presence; opportunity to raise national visibility.

Charles Ward has quickly established himself through robust question-asking and constituency outreach; his next steps are private members’ legislation and deeper committee engagement.

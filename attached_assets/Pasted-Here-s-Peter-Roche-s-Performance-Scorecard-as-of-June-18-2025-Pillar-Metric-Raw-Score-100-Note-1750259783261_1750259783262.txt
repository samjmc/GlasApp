Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (45/100): Near-perfect attendance but minimal written output—only 21 PQs and no bills. Next: crank up question-writing and table a private-members’ motion.

Parliamentary Engagement (33/100): Limited floor presence and committee inputs. To improve, seek a committee vice-chair role and deliver more Dáil speeches.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and solid casework keep locals happy; securing a high-profile local project would boost this score.

Public & Media Impact (40/100): A small media footprint and modest social-media base suggest room to grow. Broader press outreach and a digital-engagement push are needed.

Peter Roche has strong attendance and constituency foundations, but to lift his next scorecard he’ll need to sponsor legislation, amplify his parliamentary contributions, and raise his public profile.

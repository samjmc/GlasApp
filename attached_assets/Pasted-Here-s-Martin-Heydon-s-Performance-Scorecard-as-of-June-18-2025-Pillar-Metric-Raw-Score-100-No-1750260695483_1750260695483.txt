Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (46/100): One private members’ motion and no questions; solid voting record. Next step: introduce or co-sponsor additional motions or bills to move beyond minimal legislative contributions.

Parliamentary Engagement (33/100): Speaks occasionally in the Dáil but, as a Minister, committee work is limited. Greater backbench-style interventions or sponsoring more debates would help.

Constituency Service (58/100): Regular clinics and a strong casework record; securing a headline‐grabbing local project (e.g., major infrastructure or community centre) would boost this pillar.

Public & Media Impact (53/100): Decent regional and national press coverage plus a modest social-media following—targeted digital campaigns and more proactive media pitches could amplify his profile.

Martin Heydon shows up in the Chamber and for his constituents, but to climb on the next scorecard he needs to turn that presence into more sponsored legislation, higher-profile Dáil contributions, and an expanded media footprint.

Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (70/100): Stellar attendance and prolific written questions—but no bills sponsored.

Parliamentary Engagement (70/100): Strong committee and floor-speech presence, driven by his housing brief.

Constituency Service (60/100): Regular clinics and solid casework, with tangible wins on local housing campaigns.

Public & Media Impact (55/100): Good media visibility on housing issues and a growing social-media following; scope to broaden his public profile.

Rory Hearne, as Social Democrats Spokesperson on Housing, leverages rigorous scrutiny and robust constituency outreach—his next steps could include sponsoring private members’ legislation and deepening his national media engagement.

Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (46/100): Excellent attendance but virtually no sponsored bills or questions this term. Next step: start tabling private members’ motions and ramp up written questions.

Parliamentary Engagement (43/100): As Minister of State, Richmond contributes behind the scenes but needs to amplify his floor presence and take on committee leadership roles.

Constituency Service (60/100): Consistent clinics and strong casework resolution; securing larger-scale projects will further solidify his local standing.

Public & Media Impact (60/100): Good press visibility and a solid social-media base; expanding outreach—especially national media—will boost his profile.

Neale Richmond’s strengths lie in reliable attendance and behind-the-scenes contributions as a junior minister. To elevate his next scorecard, he should focus on sponsoring legislation, increasing parliamentary questions, and stepping up his public and floor-debate profile.

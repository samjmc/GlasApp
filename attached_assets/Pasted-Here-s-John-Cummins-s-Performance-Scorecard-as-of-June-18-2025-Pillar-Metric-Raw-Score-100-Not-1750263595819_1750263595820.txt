Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (57/100):
Cummins’s strong attendance and regular questioning are solid for a first-term TD, but he has yet to sponsor any private-members’ motions. Introducing a PMB would significantly boost this pillar.

Parliamentary Engagement (53/100):
As Minister of State, he’s very active in committee but has delivered only a handful of Dáil floor contributions. Stepping up formal speeches in debates and topical questions would raise his engagement.

Constituency Service (58/100):
Monthly clinics and a ~75 % casework resolution rate underpin reliable local service. Securing a marquee Waterford project (e.g., major housing or planning initiative) could push this higher.

Public & Media Impact (65/100):
Moderate regional press coverage and a growing LinkedIn following give him a platform—expanding into X/Facebook and national-media interviews will amplify his visibility.

Overall, Minister of State John Cummins combines diligent committee work and constituency engagement with solid attendance. To climb on the next scorecard, he should translate that platform into sponsored legislation, deeper Dáil contributions, and a broader digital-media presence.

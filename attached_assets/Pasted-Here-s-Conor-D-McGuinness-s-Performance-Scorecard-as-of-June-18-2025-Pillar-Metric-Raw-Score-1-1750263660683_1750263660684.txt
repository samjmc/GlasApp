Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (50/100):
Conor McGuinness has solid attendance and is active in written questions but has yet to sponsor a private-members’ motion—introducing a PMB would meaningfully boost his legislative footprint.

Parliamentary Engagement (48/100):
As newly appointed Chair of a select committee, his committee work earns top marks (80/100), but floor-speech volume remains low (~3 speeches → 25/100). More Dáil contributions will lift this pillar.

Constituency Service (58/100):
Regular clinics and a robust casework turnaround (~75 %) underscore effective local service; securing a high-profile Waterford project (e.g., major coastal infrastructure) would strengthen this score.

Public & Media Impact (50/100):
A moderate press footprint and ~5 K Facebook likes provide a platform—targeted media appearances and an expanded digital-outreach campaign (especially on X/Instagram) can amplify his visibility.

Overall, McGuinness lays a dependable foundation in committee leadership and constituency work. To climb on the next scorecard, he should translate that groundwork into sponsored legislation, deeper Dáil contributions, and broadened media engagement.

Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (44/100): Perfect attendance but no questions or bills—urgent need to table private-members’ motions and kick-start PQ writing.

Parliamentary Engagement (42/100): Moderate committee work and a handful of speeches; boosting floor contributions and seeking committee leadership will raise this.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and solid casework are strengths; securing a marquee local project would further improve her standing.

Public & Media Impact (43/100): A foothold in local media and a modest online following; expanding into national press and accelerating social-media growth are key.

Jennifer Carroll MacNeill has solid constituency foundations and attendance but must focus on sponsoring legislation, ramping up parliamentary questions, and amplifying her public profile to lift her next scorecard.

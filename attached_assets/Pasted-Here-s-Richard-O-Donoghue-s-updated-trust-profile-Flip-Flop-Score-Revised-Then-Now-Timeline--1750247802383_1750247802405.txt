Flip-Flop Events:

2015: Party-change from Fianna Fáil to Independent (ideological distance moderate) → magnitude 20/100

2023: Shift into a self-styled centre-right/populist party (less distance from his independent stance) → magnitude 10/100

2021: Public misstatement on vaccine timing → magnitude 10/100

Average magnitude: (20 + 10 + 10) / 3 ≈ 13 / 100

Frequency factor: (3 events − 1) × 5 pts = 10 pts

Revised Flip-Flop Score: 13 + 10 = 23 / 100

🧭 Consistency, Reliability & Integrity

Metric	Score (/100)	Notes
Consistency	75	Steady focus on rural infrastructure, small-business support and local clinics since 2014, with no major policy U-turns beyond party-alignment shifts.
Reliability	85	Elected TD in 2020 (defeating an incumbent), re-elected in 2024 under the Independent Ireland banner; serves as General Secretary, indicating party and voter trust.
Integrity	80	No ethics investigations; the vaccine remark was a misstatement he promptly corrected, but it dented confidence briefly. Otherwise maintains transparent declarations of his contracting business and property interests.

⭐ Total Trust Score: 70 / 100

Base trust = (75 + 85 + 80) / 3 ≈ 80

Flip-flop penalty = ½ × 23 ≈ 11.5

Total Trust = 80 − 11.5 ≈ 68.5 → rounded to 70 / 100

Interpretation:
Richard O’Donoghue combines a strong constituency track record and reliable electoral performance with broadly consistent policy positions on local issues. However, his multiple shifts—leaving Fianna Fáil, then entering a new centre-right party, plus the vaccine-timing misstatement—incur a moderate flip-flop penalty, resulting in a Total Trust Score of 70/100.

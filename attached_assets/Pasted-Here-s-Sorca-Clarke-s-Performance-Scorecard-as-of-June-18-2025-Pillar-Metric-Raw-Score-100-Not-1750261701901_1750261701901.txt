Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (90/100): Exceptional question volume and perfect attendance, plus five motions carried—next step: sponsoring full private-members’ bills to cement legislative impact.

Parliamentary Engagement (67/100): Strong questioning and committee work, but floor contributions are relatively few—more Dáil speeches and leading questions in Committee would boost this.

Constituency Service (60/100): Solid clinics and casework; translating advocacy into a headline capital project (e.g., new health or education facility) would elevate this pillar.

Public & Media Impact (53/100): Good regional press footprint and steady digital presence, but social-media strategy could be expanded and engagement deepened to broaden reach.

Sorca Clarke combines exemplary attendance and legislative initiative with diligent constituency work—but to climb on the next scorecard, she should convert those strengths into full private-members’ bills, more visible Dáil engagements, and a richer media/digital footprint.

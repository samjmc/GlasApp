Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (45/100): Dillon’s strong voting attendance is offset by very limited bill sponsorship and a modest volume of written questions. Introducing additional private-members’ bills would lift this score.

Parliamentary Engagement (41/100): Solid committee involvement but relatively few floor speeches and questions. Seeking more debate time and sponsoring back-bench motions could boost his engagement.

Constituency Service (58/100): Regular clinics and reliable casework underpin a solid constituency base; delivering a marquee local project (e.g., significant transport or housing scheme) would push this pillar higher.

Public & Media Impact (70/100): A substantial social-media following combined with steady press coverage gives him a good platform—leveraging this into targeted national-media interviews and digital campaigns can amplify his profile.

While Alan Dillon shows dependable local work and robust attendance, his next leap will come from turning that reliability into sponsored legislation, increased speaking roles, and high-impact community wins.

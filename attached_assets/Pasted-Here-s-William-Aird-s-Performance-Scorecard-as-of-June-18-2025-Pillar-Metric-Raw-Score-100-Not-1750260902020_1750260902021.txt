Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (46/100): Perfect attendance but no sponsored motions and a modest question volume. Next step: table or co-sponsor a private-members’ bill.

Parliamentary Engagement (44/100): Moderate committee work and a handful of speeches, but could boost profile with more floor debates and backbench contributions.

Constituency Service (60/100): Solid clinic schedule and strong casework turnaround; securing a high-impact local capital project would push this pillar higher.

Public & Media Impact (45/100): A modest local press footprint and social-media following; targeted digital campaigns and proactive national media outreach could broaden reach.

William Aird is building parliamentary and local credentials—but to climb on the next scorecard, he needs to turn reliable presence into sponsored legislation, deeper Dáil interventions, and an amplified media profile.

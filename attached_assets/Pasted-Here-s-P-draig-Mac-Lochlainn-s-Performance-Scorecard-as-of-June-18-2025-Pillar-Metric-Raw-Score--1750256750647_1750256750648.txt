Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (64/100): Solid question-asking and strong attendance, but no sponsored bills yet.

Parliamentary Engagement (65/100): High committee leadership and whip responsibilities make him a central parliamentary operator, though full-Dáil speeches remain modest.

Constituency Service (62/100): Reliable clinics, strong casework resolution, and steady local infrastructure wins.

Public & Media Impact (55/100): Good regional press and a growing social-media base; room to amplify national profile.

Pádraig Mac Lochlainn combines whip duties and committee leadership with diligent constituency outreach—his next steps are to translate that energy into private members’ legislation and a more prominent Dáil-floor presence.

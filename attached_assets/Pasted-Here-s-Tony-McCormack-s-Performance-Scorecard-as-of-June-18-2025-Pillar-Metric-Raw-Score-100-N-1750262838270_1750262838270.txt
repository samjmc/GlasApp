Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (47/100): Solid attendance but yet to sponsor any PMBs and a modest question count—introducing a Private Members’ Bill and stepping up written questions would boost this pillar.

Parliamentary Engagement (35/100): Regular committee inputs are a good start, but floor time is minimal; more Dáil speeches and perhaps aiming for a committee deputy-chair role would raise his engagement.

Constituency Service (58/100): Monthly clinics and a healthy casework resolution rate underpin reliable local service; securing a headline project (e.g., major transport or community facility) would lift this score.

Public & Media Impact (28/100): Limited press mentions and a modest social-media footprint suggest significant room for growth—targeted regional media features and a broader digital campaign are key.

As a newly elected TD for Offaly, Tony McCormack has laid the groundwork in attendance and local clinics. To climb on the next scorecard, he should translate that reliability into sponsored legislation, increased Dáil contributions, and amplified media visibility.

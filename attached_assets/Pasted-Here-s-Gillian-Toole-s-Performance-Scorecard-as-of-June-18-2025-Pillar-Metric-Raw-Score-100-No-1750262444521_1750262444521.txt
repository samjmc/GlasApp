Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (43/100): As a newly elected TD, Toole has solid attendance but has yet to sponsor PMBs; adding motions will be key to pushing policy.

Parliamentary Engagement (37/100): Regular committee involvement but few floor speeches; securing a committee leadership role or increasing debates will raise her profile.

Constituency Service (57/100): Monthly clinics and a strong casework record underpin effective local service—landing a high-impact project (e.g., a major transport upgrade) would boost this pillar.

Public & Media Impact (38/100): A modest social-media footprint and a handful of press mentions suggest room to grow—targeted national-media pieces and a broader digital campaign can amplify her voice.

As an Independent TD in her first term, Gillian Toole has laid a reliable foundation. To climb on the next scorecard, she should translate constituency strength into sponsored legislation, deepen her Dáil contributions, and expand her media presence.

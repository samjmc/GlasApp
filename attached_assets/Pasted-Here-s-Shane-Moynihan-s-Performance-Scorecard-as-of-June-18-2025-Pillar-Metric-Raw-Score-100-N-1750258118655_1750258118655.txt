Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (72/100): Stellar attendance and prolific question-asking, but yet to sponsor a bill.

Parliamentary Engagement (72/100): Balanced mix of committee scrutiny and floor contributions; prime mover on key transport debates.

Constituency Service (61.7/100): Regular clinics and strong casework, with tangible wins on local infrastructure campaigns.

Public & Media Impact (55/100): Solid regional profile and a growing online following; room to broaden national media presence.

Shane Moynihan has quickly established himself as an active Dublin Mid-West Fianna Fáil TD through vigorous questioning, committee work, and constituency outreach—his next steps include sponsoring private members’ legislation and elevating his media profile nationally.

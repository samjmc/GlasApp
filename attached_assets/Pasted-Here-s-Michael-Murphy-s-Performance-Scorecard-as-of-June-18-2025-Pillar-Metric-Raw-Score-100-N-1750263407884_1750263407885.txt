Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (47/100):
As a newly elected TD, Murphy has strong attendance but hasn’t yet sponsored any PMBs; building his Private Members’ Bill record and expanding his written-question tally will be key next steps.

Parliamentary Engagement (45/100):
Chairing the Transport Committee gives him high committee-work marks, but his floor contributions are still limited—upping his Dáil speeches (e.g., in Leaders’ Questions or topical debates) will lift this score.

Constituency Service (58/100):
Regular clinics and solid casework underpin effective local service; securing a headline-making project (e.g., a major transport or community facility upgrade) would drive this pillar higher.

Public & Media Impact (45/100):
A modest regional press footprint and a growing social-media base provide a platform—targeted media interviews and a digital-outreach campaign can amplify his visibility.

Michael Murphy shows strong committee leadership and constituency diligence. To climb on the next scorecard, he should translate that into sponsored legislation, deeper Dáil contributions, and broader media engagement.

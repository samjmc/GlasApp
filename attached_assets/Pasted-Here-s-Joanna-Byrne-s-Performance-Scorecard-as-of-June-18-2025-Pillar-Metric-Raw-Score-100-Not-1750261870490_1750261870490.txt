Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (59/100): Strong attendance and steady motion-driving, but question volume and lack of full private-members’ bills suggest room to co-sponsor or introduce substantive PMBs.

Parliamentary Engagement (47/100): Dual committee roles are solid, but floor speaking remains modest—more full-Dáil contributions beyond motions would lift this score.

Constituency Service (60/100): Regular clinics and solid casework form a strong base; securing a headline local capital project (e.g., a major housing retrofit programme) would push this pillar higher.

Public & Media Impact (52/100): A steady regional press footprint and healthy Facebook following suggest good foundations—targeted digital campaigns and national media pitches can expand her profile.

Joanna Byrne combines active committee work and constituency engagement with emerging media visibility—but to climb on the next scorecard, she needs to translate that into full private-members’ bills, more visible Dáil floor time, and amplified national media outreach.

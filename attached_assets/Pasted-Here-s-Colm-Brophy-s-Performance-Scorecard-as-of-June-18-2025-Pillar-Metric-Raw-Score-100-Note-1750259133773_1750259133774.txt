Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (46/100): Stellar attendance but zero questions or bills—needs to start tabling private-members’ motions and ramping up written PQs.

Parliamentary Engagement (53/100): As Committee Chair, Brophy contributes heavily behind the scenes; boosting his floor-speech count further would cement his profile.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and solid casework. Securing marquee local projects would push this pillar higher.

Public & Media Impact (60/100): Good press visibility and a solid social-media base; expanding into targeted national outlets and growing online engagement will be key.

Colm Brophy’s strengths lie in committee leadership and perfect attendance. To lift his next scorecard, he should sponsor legislation, increase parliamentary questions, and seek headline-grabbing local wins.

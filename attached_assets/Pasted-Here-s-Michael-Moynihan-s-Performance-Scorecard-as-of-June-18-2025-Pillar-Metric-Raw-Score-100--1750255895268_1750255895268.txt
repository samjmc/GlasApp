Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (57/100): Strong attendance but relatively few written questions and no sponsored bills.

Parliamentary Engagement (47/100): Limited to ministerial responses and a handful of floor speeches; no committee role to date.

Constituency Service (60/100): Regular clinics and solid casework delivery, with measurable wins on local infrastructure funding.

Public & Media Impact (45/100): Low regional press profile and modest social-media footprint; opportunity to engage a wider audience.

Michael Moynihan brings near-perfect attendance and reliable constituency outreach to his role as Minister of State for Special Education, but could boost his legislative sponsorship and broaden his parliamentary and public engagement.

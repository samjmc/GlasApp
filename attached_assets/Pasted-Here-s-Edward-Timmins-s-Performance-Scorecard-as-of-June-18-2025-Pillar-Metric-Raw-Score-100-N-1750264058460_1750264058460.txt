Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (44/100):
Strong attendance (90/100) is offset by no sponsored PMBs (20/100) and a modest questions tally (22/100). Introducing a private-members’ bill would lift this pillar.

Parliamentary Engagement (36/100):
Active in committees (60/100) but limited floor-speech time (25/100) and questions (22/100). More Dáil contributions—especially topical debates—would boost his engagement score.

Constituency Service (58/100):
Regular clinics and a solid casework resolution rate underpin effective local service. Securing a marquee Wicklow project (e.g., major transport or health-service upgrade) could push this pillar higher.

Public & Media Impact (40/100):
A moderate press footprint and a combined social-media following of around 2.6 K provide a base—targeted digital campaigns and national-level media interviews can significantly amplify his profile.

As a newly elected TD, Edward Timmins has laid reliable groundwork in attendance and constituency work. To climb on the next scorecard, he should translate that foundation into sponsored legislation, deeper Dáil contributions, and broader media and digital outreach.

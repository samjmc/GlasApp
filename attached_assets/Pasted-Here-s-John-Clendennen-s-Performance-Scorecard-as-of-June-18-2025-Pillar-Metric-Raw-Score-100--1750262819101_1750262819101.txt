Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (44/100): As a new TD, Clendennen’s attendance is solid but he hasn’t yet sponsored PMBs or built a large questions portfolio. Introducing a Private Members’ Bill and ramping up questions would boost this score.

Parliamentary Engagement (33/100): He’s engaged in committee work but has delivered only a few floor speeches. Taking on a committee role with more visible contributions and increasing Dáil speaking time are next steps.

Constituency Service (58/100): Monthly clinics and strong casework ratings show he’s establishing a reliable local presence. Securing a marquee local project (e.g., a major transport upgrade) could push this pillar higher.

Public & Media Impact (40/100): Moderate press coverage and a modest X following give him a foundation — targeted media interviews and a digital-outreach campaign will be key to growing his profile.

Clendennen has laid a dependable groundwork in Offaly. To climb on the next scorecard, he should translate that into sponsored legislation, deeper floor engagement, and amplified media visibility.

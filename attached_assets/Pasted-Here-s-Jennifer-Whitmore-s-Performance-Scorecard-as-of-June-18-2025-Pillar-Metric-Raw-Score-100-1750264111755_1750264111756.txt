Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (65/100):
Two substantive PMBs and a healthy batch of written questions, plus strong attendance, give Whitmore a solid legislative base. Further PMBs—especially on climate implementation—would push this higher.

Parliamentary Engagement (55/100):
Active committee scrutiny and regular questions earn good marks, but floor-speech volume (≈6) is mid-range; more Dáil interventions would bolster this pillar.

Constituency Service (60/100):
Monthly clinics and an ~80 % case-resolution rate reflect dependable local work. Securing a headline Wicklow infrastructure or flood-relief project would strengthen her local impact.

Public & Media Impact (53/100):
Moderate press coverage and a combined social-media reach of around 14 K provide a platform. A targeted digital-outreach push and national-media features could amplify her profile further.

Jennifer Whitmore shows strong constituency diligence and committee leadership, backed by solid legislative work. To climb on the next scorecard, she should translate that momentum into additional PMBs, higher floor-speech frequency, and a focused media-digital campaign.

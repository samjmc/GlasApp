🏁 Final Verdict
Cathal Crowe is a consistent and engaged TD with strong local roots and no flip‑flops. However, procedural missteps—particularly nondisclosure of property ownership and income—plus a factual error in the Dáil, lower his integrity score. He seems reliable and earnest but would benefit from heightened diligence on transparency and accuracy.

Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (45/100): Strong attendance but no written questions or sponsored motions. To improve, he needs to drive a private-members’ bill or co-sponsor Dáil motions.

Parliamentary Engagement (47/100): Committee chairmanship is a standout, but floor contributions and questions are minimal. More backbench speeches and written queries would raise this score.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and solid casework; securing larger headline projects (e.g., major infrastructure schemes) could push this pillar higher.

Public & Media Impact (50/100): A respectable local media footprint and Facebook presence, but a broader digital strategy (expanded X/Instagram activity, national media outreach) could amplify his profile.

Kieran O’Donnell brings strong committee leadership and constituency diligence—but must translate that presence into sponsored legislation, more visible Dáil interventions, and an expanded media/digital footprint to climb on the next scorecard.

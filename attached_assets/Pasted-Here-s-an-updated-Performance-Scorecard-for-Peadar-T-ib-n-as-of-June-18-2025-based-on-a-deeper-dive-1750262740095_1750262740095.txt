Key shifts from the prior estimate:

Bills Sponsored: Confirmed two distinct PMBs (Smartphones Bill & Maternity Care Bill) rather than three or more—keeps that sub-score at 40.

Debates Spoken: Four recorded contributions in 2025 (Leaders’ Questions) rather than just six unspecified speeches—pulls that metric down to 30/100.

Social Media: His main X account (@Toibin1) now at ~37.9 K followers—up from 49 on his personal handle—boosting that sub-score to 90/100.

This more rigorous look yields an Overall Performance Index of ~64/100, up from the initial 61, chiefly driven by a far stronger digital reach balanced against more limited floor time and PMB sponsorship. If you’ve spotted additional bills, speeches or committee roles I missed—let me know and I’ll fold them in!

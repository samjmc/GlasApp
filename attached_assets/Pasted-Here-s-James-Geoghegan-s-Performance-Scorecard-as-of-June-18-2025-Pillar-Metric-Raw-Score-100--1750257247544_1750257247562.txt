Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (63/100): Strong attendance and a growing slate of parliamentary questions, but no sponsored legislation yet.

Parliamentary Engagement (53/100): Questions remain his main channel; deeper committee work and floor speeches could lift this.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and casework, with moderate local grant wins.

Public & Media Impact (45/100): Modest regional press presence and social-media footprint; opportunity to expand his profile nationally.

James Geoghegan has quickly established himself through diligent questioning and constituency outreach—his next steps are private members’ bills and broader parliamentary and media engagement.

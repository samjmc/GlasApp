Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (73/100): Outstanding written-question output and perfect attendance, though no sponsored bills—next target: introduce a private-members’ motion.

Parliamentary Engagement (80/100): High marks for committee work and solid floor contributions; could further amplify impact by leading key debates.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and strong casework; securing a high-profile local project would drive this pillar higher.

Public & Media Impact (60/100): Good press visibility and a robust social-media base; expanding into broadcast media and continuing to grow online engagement will boost her reach.

Mairéad Farrell combines relentless scrutiny with active committee leadership. To push her next scorecard into the top tier, she should translate that energy into sponsored legislation and headline-grabbing local wins.

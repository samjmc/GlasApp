Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (65/100):
Strong question volume and near-perfect attendance offset by only one PMB; sponsoring a second Private Members’ Bill would deepen her legislative record.

Parliamentary Engagement (73/100):
Frequent Dáil contributions and solid committee work, with room to chair a committee or lead a high-profile inquiry to cement her role as a policy driver.

Constituency Service (67/100):
Reliable clinics and casework, plus significant school-funding wins, provide a strong base—securing a headline local infrastructure project (e.g., major road upgrade) would push this higher.

Public & Media Impact (88/100):
A high-visibility ministerial portfolio and robust social-media reach place her among the most visible TDs; targeted media series or national-level interviews could broaden her appeal beyond her portfolio.

As Deputy Leader and Education & Youth Minister, Helen McEntee excels at visibility and constituent delivery. To climb on the next scorecard, translating that platform into additional sponsored legislation and committee leadership will be key.

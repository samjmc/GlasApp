Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (53/100): Solid attendance and a modest volume of written questions—next step is sponsoring private-members’ motions to move beyond queries.

Parliamentary Engagement (50/100): Regular committee work but limited floor contributions; seeking a committee leadership role and more speeches would boost his profile.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and strong casework provide a solid foundation; securing a high-impact local project (e.g., major transport upgrade) would raise this pillar.

Public & Media Impact (48/100): A modest press footprint and social-media following suggest room to grow—targeted national media outreach and digital engagement campaigns will be key.

Naoise Ó Cearúil is present and diligent in constituency work; to climb on the next scorecard, he should translate that presence into sponsored legislation, deeper committee leadership, and amplified media visibility.

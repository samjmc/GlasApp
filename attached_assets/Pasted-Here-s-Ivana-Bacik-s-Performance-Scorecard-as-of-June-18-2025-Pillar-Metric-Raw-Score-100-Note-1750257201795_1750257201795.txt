Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (63/100): Flawless attendance and strong questioning, but no bills sponsored.

Parliamentary Engagement (63/100): Active floor speaker and party interrogator; could deepen formal committee roles.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and casework, yet larger-scale local projects remain an opportunity.

Public & Media Impact (80/100): High national profile and robust social-media presence as Labour Party leader.

Ivana Bacik combines first-class attendance and vigorous questioning with a commanding media profile—her next steps could include sponsoring private members’ legislation and taking on formal committee leadership to further broaden her parliamentary impact.

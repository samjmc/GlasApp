Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (51/100): Attendance is solid but zero bills and only moderate question-writing. Next step: table private-members’ motions and boost PQ output.

Parliamentary Engagement (52/100): Regular committee inputs but few floor speeches. To improve, seek committee vice-chair roles and deliver more Dáil contributions.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and strong casework; securing a high-profile local project would raise this pillar.

Public & Media Impact (48/100): Steady regional press coverage and a modest social-media base—expanding into national outlets and growing followers online will be key.

John Lahart has the attendance and constituency groundwork in place; to climb on the next scorecard, he needs to start sponsoring legislation, amplify his Chamber presence, and broaden his media footprint.

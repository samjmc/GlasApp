Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (60/100): Boyd Barrett’s pen hasn’t produced any bills, but he’s unleashed a torrent of 317 written questions—top of the class—though his attendance has slipped to ≈59%. Next: get a private-members’ bill on the table and tighten up sitting attendance.

Parliamentary Engagement (73/100): Solid committee work and roughly fifteen floor speeches show he’s more than just question-fodder. To push this higher, he could aim for a committee vice-chair role or lead a high-profile debate.

Constituency Service (60/100): Steady clinics and strong casework keep constituents onside; securing a headline-grabbing local project (think major community center or transport upgrade) would really fire up this pillar.

Public & Media Impact (60/100): Richard’s got a decent press footprint and a growing online following; expanding into broadcast interviews and ramping up social-media engagement (perhaps the odd viral soundbite) will take him to the next level.

Richard Boyd Barrett is the Dáil’s question machine—now he just needs to convert some of that verbosity into sponsored legislation and splashy local wins to make his next scorecard truly sing.

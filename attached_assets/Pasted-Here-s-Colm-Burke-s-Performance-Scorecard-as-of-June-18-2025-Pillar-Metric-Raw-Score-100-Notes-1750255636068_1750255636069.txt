Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (64/100): Strong question-asking and high attendance, but no private members’ legislation.

Parliamentary Engagement (72/100): Very active across multiple committees (including as Leas-Chair on Health), with solid debate contributions.

Constituency Service (62/100): Regular clinics and strong casework, plus wins securing drug-strategy funding; could boost clinic frequency.

Public & Media Impact (50/100): Modest press footprint and social-media following; opportunity to amplify national profile.

Colm Burke combines ministerial-level committee leadership with diligent constituency work and parliamentary questioning, with room to translate that engagement into sponsored bills and a broader public presence.

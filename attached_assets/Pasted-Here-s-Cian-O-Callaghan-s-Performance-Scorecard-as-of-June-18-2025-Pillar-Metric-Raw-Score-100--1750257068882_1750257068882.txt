Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (64/100): Near-perfect attendance and prolific question-asking, but still no sponsored bills.

Parliamentary Engagement (72/100): Strong committee leadership and solid floor-speech contributions; questions remain a key channel.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and casework, with some successful local grant wins.

Public & Media Impact (65/100): Good national media presence and a robust social-media following.

Cian O’Callaghan leverages vigorous questioning and committee roles to drive impact; his next steps are private members’ legislation and further amplifying his public profile.

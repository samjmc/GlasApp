Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (65/100): Exceptional attendance and solid use of written questions, but no sponsored bills yet.

Parliamentary Engagement (65/100): Active in committees and Q&A, with room to step up full-Dáil speeches.

Constituency Service (60/100): Regular clinics and good casework resolution; larger-scale project wins remain an opportunity.

Public & Media Impact (50/100): Modest regional media footprint and social-media following; potential to amplify profile nationally.

Donna McGettigan, a Sinn Féin first-term TD for Clare since November 2024, shows strong engagement patterns typical of a newcomer but still has clear avenues to broaden her legislative initiatives and public visibility.

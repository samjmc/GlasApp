Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (73/100): A powerhouse of written questions (697) and perfect attendance, but still no sponsored bills—next move: table a private-members’ motion.

Parliamentary Engagement (80/100): Heavy floor presence with roughly 25 full-Dáil speeches; could boost further by taking on a committee vice-chair or spokesperson role.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and solid casework underpin his local standing; securing a marquee community or infrastructure project would elevate this pillar.

Public & Media Impact (68/100): Good press visibility and a strong social-media base; expanding into broadcast media and pushing digital campaigns will enhance his reach.

Michael Cahill combines relentless parliamentary scrutiny with dependable constituency work. To lift his next scorecard even higher, he should convert that scrutiny into sponsored legislation and headline-grabbing local wins.

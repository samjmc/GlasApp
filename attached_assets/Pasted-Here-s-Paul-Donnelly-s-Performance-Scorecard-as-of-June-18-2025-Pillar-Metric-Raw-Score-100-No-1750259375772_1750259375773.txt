Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (63/100): Solid attendance and a healthy question-asking rate (192 PQs), but no sponsored bills. Next step: table a private-members’ motion.

Parliamentary Engagement (62/100): Contributes regularly in committee and on the floor, though lacks leadership roles. To improve, seek vice-chair spots and deliver more speeches.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and strong casework form a good base; securing larger, headline-making local projects would elevate this score.

Public & Media Impact (55/100): A moderate press profile and social-media following show promise. Expanding into national media and accelerating digital outreach will be key.

Paul Donnelly combines dependable presence with vigorous question-writing. To lift his next scorecard, he should focus on sponsoring legislation, deepening committee leadership, and broadening his media reach.

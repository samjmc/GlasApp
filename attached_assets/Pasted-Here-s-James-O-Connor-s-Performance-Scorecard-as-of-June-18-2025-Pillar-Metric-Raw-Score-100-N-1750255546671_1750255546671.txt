Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (58/100): Strong question-asking and near-perfect attendance, but no sponsored legislation.

Parliamentary Engagement (60/100): Leading committee work as Chair, yet full-Dáil contributions could be expanded.

Constituency Service (60/100): Regular clinics and solid casework, with moderate success on local project funding.

Public & Media Impact (55/100): Decent regional media presence and a growing online following; room to reach a national audience.

James O’Connor combines youthful energy with committee leadership and constituency responsiveness, while the next step is to translate that into private members’ bills and broader public visibility.

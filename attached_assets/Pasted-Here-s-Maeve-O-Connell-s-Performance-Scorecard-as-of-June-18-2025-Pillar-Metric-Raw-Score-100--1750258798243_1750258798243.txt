Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (64/100): Strong attendance and solid question-writing (196 so far), but no sponsored bills—next step: table private-members’ motions.

Parliamentary Engagement (62/100): Moderate committee inputs (13 to date) and a handful of floor speeches—opportunity to take on leadership roles in committees.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and casework performance; securing flagship local projects would raise this further.

Public & Media Impact (55/100): Growing media profile and social-media base; expanding press outreach and digital engagement will be key.

Maeve O’Connell has laid a credible foundation in her first seven months: to boost her next scorecard, she should focus on sponsoring legislation, amplifying her floor contributions, and broadening her public profile.

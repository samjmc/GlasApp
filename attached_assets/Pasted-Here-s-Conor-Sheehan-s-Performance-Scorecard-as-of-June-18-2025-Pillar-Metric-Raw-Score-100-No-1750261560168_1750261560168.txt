Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (66/100): Three motions carried signal ambition, and perfect attendance bolsters this pillar—next step: introduce or co-sponsor a private-members’ bill.

Parliamentary Engagement (39/100): Speaks effectively when moving motions, but no committee seat and moderate floor time—securing a committee role or more topical debates would strengthen his parliamentary footprint.

Constituency Service (60/100): Regular clinics and solid casework are positives; translating housing advocacy into a major local scheme (e.g., a build-out of council homes) would elevate this pillar.

Public & Media Impact (48/100): A healthy housing-focused media profile and a growing digital following suggest solid foundations—targeted national media pitches and a richer social-media strategy could broaden his reach.

Conor Sheehan combines strong attendance and targeted motions with active constituency work—but to climb on the next scorecard, he needs to drive substantive legislation, deepen committee engagement, and amplify his media and digital presence.

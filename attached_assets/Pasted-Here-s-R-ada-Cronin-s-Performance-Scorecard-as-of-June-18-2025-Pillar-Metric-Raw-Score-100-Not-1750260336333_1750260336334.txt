Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (50/100): Strong attendance but low question output (93 PQs) and no sponsored bills. Next step: ramp up question-writing and table a private-members’ motion.

Parliamentary Engagement (41/100): Moderate committee work and limited floor contributions; she should seek committee leadership roles and speak more frequently.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and solid casework underpin her local reputation; securing a high-profile local project would further strengthen this pillar.

Public & Media Impact (43/100): A modest press footprint and social-media base indicate room to grow—targeted national media outreach and a digital-engagement push will be key.

Réada Cronin has built a dependable foundation in attendance and constituency outreach. To lift her next scorecard, she needs to convert that presence into higher written-output, sponsored legislation, and amplified public visibility.

Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (62/100):
Michael Fitzmaurice maintains solid attendance and a strong written-questions record, but has yet to sponsor any private-members’ bills—introducing a PMB would significantly bolster this pillar.

Parliamentary Engagement (58/100):
His role on the Agriculture & Food Committee and regular Leaders’ Questions appearances demonstrate engagement, yet floor speeches remain modest. A push for committee leadership or more Dáil contributions would raise this score.

Constituency Service (60/100):
Monthly clinics and robust case-resolution underpin effective local service; landing a headline-making local project (e.g., major community or infrastructure development) would strengthen his standing.

Public & Media Impact (73/100):
Regular press coverage coupled with a healthy Facebook base gives him a strong platform—leveraging this into targeted media interviews and a broader digital-outreach campaign can amplify his voice further.

Overall, Fitzmaurice combines diligent constituency work and committee engagement with a high-impact media presence. To climb on the next scorecard, he should translate that foundation into sponsored legislation and deeper floor-speech involvement.

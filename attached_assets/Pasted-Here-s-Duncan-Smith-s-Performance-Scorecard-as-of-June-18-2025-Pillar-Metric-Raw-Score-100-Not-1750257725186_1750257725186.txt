Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (59/100): Solid attendance and a growing set of parliamentary questions, but no bill sponsorship yet.

Parliamentary Engagement (60/100): Steady committee involvement and floor contributions; could boost private members’ motions.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and strong casework, with moderate success on local project funding.

Public & Media Impact (45/100): Limited press presence and modest social-media following; opportunity to raise his profile.

Duncan Smith demonstrates dependable parliamentary work and constituency outreach for Dublin Fingal East Labour; next steps include sponsoring private members’ legislation and expanding his media engagement.

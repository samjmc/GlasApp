Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (55/100):
Strong sitting attendance and a healthy questions record are offset by no PMBs; sponsoring even one Private Members’ Bill would markedly improve this pillar.

Parliamentary Engagement (35/100):
As Ceann Comhairle, her role is to preside impartially rather than drive legislation or debate, which explains low committee contributions and floor-speech counts.

Constituency Service (57/100):
Regular clinics and solid casework underpin reliable local service; securing a headline Wexford infrastructure or community project would boost this score.

Public & Media Impact (63/100):
A surge of national and regional press coverage during the speaking-rights controversy and a mid-five-thousand social-media base give her a strong platform—leveraging that into targeted outreach could cement her profile.

Despite the constraints of the Ceann Comhairle role, Verona Murphy maintains high attendance and constituency engagement; her next “scorecard leap” would come from translating her platform into sponsored legislation (if she returns to back-bench), deeper local wins, and sustained positive media outreach.

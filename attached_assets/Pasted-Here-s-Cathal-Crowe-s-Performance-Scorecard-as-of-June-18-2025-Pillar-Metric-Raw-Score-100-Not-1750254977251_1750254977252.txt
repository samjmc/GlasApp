Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (69/100): Excellent attendance and prolific use of parliamentary questions, but still no private members’ bills.

Parliamentary Engagement (83/100): High activity in committees and debates; could diversify into sponsoring motions.

Constituency Service (62/100): Solid casework and real wins on local infrastructure, though public-facing clinics could be increased.

Public & Media Impact (55/100): Decent regional coverage and growing social-media presence; opportunity to earn more national attention.

Overall, Cathal Crowe demonstrates strong engagement in Dublin and at home in Clare, particularly through questions and committee work, but there’s room to grow his legislative initiative and broader public profile.

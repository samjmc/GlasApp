Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (43/100): Attendance is solid, but with no sponsored bills and relatively few questions, she trails many peers. Next step: table private-members’ motions and step up question-writing.

Parliamentary Engagement (43/100): Consistent committee involvement but minimal floor presence. To improve, she should seek committee vice-chair roles and deliver more Dáil speeches.

Constituency Service (60/100): Regular clinics and strong casework outcomes are a good foundation. Targeting larger-scale local projects would push this higher.

Public & Media Impact (48/100): Local press and a growing online following show promise. Broadening national media outreach and accelerating social-media growth will be key.

Catherine Ardagh has established steady attendance and constituency work but needs to amplify her legislative output and public profile to climb higher on the next scorecard.

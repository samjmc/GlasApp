Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (71/100): Two carried motions, strong question output, and solid attendance—but to push past peers she should co-sponsor or introduce a full private-members’ bill.

Parliamentary Engagement (67/100): Chairing a high-profile Committee is a major asset; more full-Dáil floor interventions would round out this pillar.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and casework, yet no headline capital project secured—securing a major local education or community scheme would boost her standing.

Public & Media Impact (48/100): A modest regional press footprint and growing Instagram following suggest room to broaden via targeted national media outreach and richer digital campaigns.

Erin McGreehan combines exemplary attendance and Committee leadership with diligent constituency work—but to climb on the next scorecard she’ll need to translate that momentum into substantive legislation, more visible Dáil contributions, and an amplified media/digital profile.

🧭 Feature Overview: Interactive Ireland Political Map
The goal is to create a heatmap-style interactive map of Ireland with layered views for:

Counties

Electoral Constituencies

Per-region user opinion overlays from quiz/poll data

Real-time information on elected and contesting representatives

🔧 Technical Requirements for Replit / Developer
🔹 1. Frontend Stack
Use Leaflet.js or Mapbox GL JS for rendering the interactive map (both support shapefiles, zoom/pan, tooltips).

Use GeoJSON boundary data for:

Irish counties

Irish Dáil electoral constituencies

Backend: Replit-compatible Flask or Node.js backend to serve data via APIs.

🔹 2. Core Functionality by Tab
A. County View
Load county boundaries from GeoJSON.

Enable:

Hover tooltips: County name + summary of public opinion (e.g., % agree/disagree)

Click event: Show modal or sidebar with:

Detailed quiz/poll data

Issues trending in this county

Voter sentiment heatmap for key bills

B. Electoral Constituency View
Load electoral boundaries GeoJSON (use OSi or Irish Electoral Commission open data).

Enable:

Hover: Constituency name + voter turnout + dominant issue

Click: Display info panel with:

Elected TDs (pull from a database or static file)

Candidates in upcoming elections

Quotes/posts from each candidate

Vote history or polling data (if available)

🔹 3. Map Interaction Features
Zoom / Pan: Allow full pan/zoom from country to constituency level.

Toggle Buttons:

"🗺️ Counties" ↔ "🏛 Constituencies" ↔ "📊 Combined View"

Layer controls for:

Quiz/Poll overlays

Topics (abortion, immigration, housing, etc.)

Election overlays (representatives)

Tooltips/Popups: Show on hover or click, powered by Leaflet’s bindTooltip and bindPopup.

🔹 4. User Opinion Heatmap Layer
Overlay quiz/poll results across the map.

Color scheme:

Yellow = strong agreement

Purple = strong disagreement

Intermediate tones = mixed/neutral

Filter dropdown (top-right or sidebar):

Select issue (e.g. "Legalize euthanasia", "Open immigration", etc.)

Map auto-updates to show sentiment across regions.

Data source: Pull user opinion data (from app database or JSON store) using backend API like /poll-data?region=X&issue=Y.

🔹 5. Elected Officials & Candidates Panel
On click of a constituency:

Show list of current representatives

Name, party, contact/social links, latest post

List of upcoming candidates

Bio, stances on trending issues, responses to polls

Admin/moderator dashboard could allow candidates to manage their profiles and posts via Replit database or Supabase.

🔹 6. Tech Stack Guidance
Frontend: HTML, TailwindCSS, JS (Leaflet.js), optional Vue or React

Data Storage:

Static GeoJSON for map boundaries (hosted locally or via CDN)

Firebase / Supabase / Replit DB for:

User answers

Candidate info

Poll metadata

API endpoints:

/poll-data

/get-candidates

/get-constituency-info

📁 Example File Requirements
Required Files:
ireland_counties.geojson

ireland_constituencies.geojson

poll_results.json (by issue, region)

candidates.json (by constituency)

📌 Suggested Roadmap for Replit Build
Build basic Leaflet map with toggle buttons for counties/constituencies

Add zoom/pan and tooltip on hover

Integrate issue filter and load dummy heatmap overlay

Add click-to-open panel for counties and constituencies

Connect database for user opinion and representative data

Style map with clean UX (dark/light toggle optional)

Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (63/100): Perfect attendance and a healthy question-asking rate (188 PQs), but no sponsored bills yet. Next step: introduce a private-members’ motion.

Parliamentary Engagement (60/100): Regular committee inputs and a handful of floor speeches show engagement, though stepping into a committee leadership role and upping debate contributions would lift this score.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and solid casework underpin his local standing; securing a marquee community or transport project would further boost this pillar.

Public & Media Impact (58/100): A decent press footprint and growing online following indicate promise—expanding national media outreach and driving social-media engagement will be key.

Louis O’Hara combines rock-solid participation with active constituency work. To climb higher on the next scorecard, he should focus on sponsoring legislation, deepening committee leadership, and amplifying his public profile.

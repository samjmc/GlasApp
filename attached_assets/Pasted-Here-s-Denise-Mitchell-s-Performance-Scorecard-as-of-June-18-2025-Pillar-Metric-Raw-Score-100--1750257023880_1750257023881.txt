Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (60/100): Excellent attendance and solid use of parliamentary questions, but still no private members’ bills.

Parliamentary Engagement (62/100): Active in committee scrutiny and floor debates; could look to sponsor motions or bills.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and casework turnaround, with moderate project wins.

Public & Media Impact (55/100): Steady media presence and social-media following; scope to expand national visibility.

Denise Mitchell combines diligent parliamentary scrutiny and constituency outreach with growing media engagement—her next steps are to translate that into private members’ legislation and elevate her profile further.

Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (52/100):
Claire Kerrane maintains solid attendance and a growing questions portfolio but has yet to sponsor a Private Members’ Bill—introducing one or more motions would meaningfully boost her legislative footprint.

Parliamentary Engagement (50/100):
As Sinn Féin’s children & youth spokesperson she’s very active in committee, yet floor-speech time is modest; increasing Dáil contributions (e.g., topical debates) would lift this pillar.

Constituency Service (60/100):
Regular clinics and strong casework resolution underpin effective local service; securing a headline-making project (e.g., major rural broadband upgrade) could push this even higher.

Public & Media Impact (60/100):
A solid regional/national press presence and nearly 6 k X followers give her a platform—targeted media appearances and digital-outreach campaigns will amplify her reach.

Claire Kerrane has built dependable committee and constituency credentials. To climb on the next scorecard, she should translate that groundwork into sponsored legislation, deeper Dáil engagement, and broader media visibility.

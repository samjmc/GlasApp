Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (60/100): Two PM motions and perfect attendance are solid; boosting written questions into substantive private-members bills would raise this further.

Parliamentary Engagement (53/100): Chairing a key committee is a major asset, but a handful of floor speeches and written questions keeps this pillar moderate. More high-profile Dáil interventions would help.

Constituency Service (60/100): Regular clinics and strong casework resolution combined with local advocacy wins (e.g., ED funding push) form a reliable base—securing a major capital project would push this higher.

Public & Media Impact (48/100): A steady regional/national press footprint and a modest but growing X audience suggest room for a targeted digital-first engagement strategy and national media outreach.

Maurice Quinlivan has strong institutional leadership (committee chair) and exemplary attendance—but to climb on the next scorecard, he needs to translate that presence into more sponsored legislation, deeper Dáil contributions, and a broader media and digital footprint.

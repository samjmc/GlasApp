Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (71/100): Top‐quartile question-asking and near-perfect attendance, though still no private members’ bills.

Parliamentary Engagement (65/100): Solid committee work and prolific questions; fewer floor speeches present an opportunity.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and strong casework; could aim for higher-profile local wins.

Public & Media Impact (53/100): Modest regional media footprint and a growing social-media base; scope to boost wider visibility.

Aindrias Moynihan shows a high level of diligence in questions, attendance, and committee scrutiny, with the next steps being to translate that engagement into sponsored legislation and a broader public profile.

Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (62/100): Excellent voting attendance but zero sponsored bills; strong use of parliamentary questions (212 so far)—next step, introduce private-members’ motions.

Parliamentary Engagement (67/100): As a frontbench spokesperson across four key areas, Gibney brings high committee input; floor speeches are still modest—could boost by leading more debates.

Constituency Service (60/100): Regular clinics and solid casework outcomes; securing larger-scale local projects would raise this score.

Public & Media Impact (48/100): Local press coverage and a growing social-media base; expanding national media presence and accelerating follower growth will be crucial.

Sinéad Gibney has laid a strong foundation in her first seven months, leveraging her frontbench roles and question-writing prowess. To climb higher next term, she should focus on sponsoring legislation, stepping up floor contributions, and amplifying her media reach.

Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (63/100):
Cullinane has moved beyond “question-only” work by sponsoring two significant private-members’ bills, alongside a solid batch of written questions and high attendance.

Parliamentary Engagement (57/100):
As Sinn Féin’s Health spokesperson he’s very active in committee, but could boost his profile with more floor speeches on key debates.

Constituency Service (58/100):
Regular clinics and a strong casework turnaround underpin his local work; securing a marquee Waterford health-service project would raise this pillar.

Public & Media Impact (73/100):
A robust Facebook presence and steady press coverage give him a strong platform—leveraging that into targeted national-media and digital campaigns will amplify his visibility.

Cullinane’s strengths lie in committee leadership, constituency responsiveness, and media reach. To climb on the next scorecard, he should translate that into additional sponsored legislation and deeper Dáil contributions.

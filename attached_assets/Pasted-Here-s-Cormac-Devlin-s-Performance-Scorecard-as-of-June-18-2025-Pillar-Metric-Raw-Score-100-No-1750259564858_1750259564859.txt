Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (54/100): Reliable attendance but minimal bill‐sponsorship and a modest 124 PQs so far—next step: table private‐members’ motions and ramp up written questions.

Parliamentary Engagement (50/100): Contributes in committees and on the floor, but without leadership roles or a high speech count; seeking a vice-chair spot or stepping up debate presence will help.

Constituency Service (60/100): Consistent clinics and strong casework underpin his local standing; securing a high-profile community or transport project would further boost his score.

Public & Media Impact (55/100): A decent regional press profile and growing social-media base show promise; expanding into national media and driving online engagement will be key.

Cormac Devlin has built a solid foundation in attendance and constituency work. To rise on the next scorecard, he should focus on sponsoring legislation, deepening committee leadership, and amplifying his public profile.

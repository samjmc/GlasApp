Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (45/100):
Aisling Dempsey’s attendance is strong and she’s beginning to build her written-questions record, but she hasn’t yet sponsored any private-members’ legislation. Introducing a PMB or motion would be the next step to solidify her legislative footprint.

Parliamentary Engagement (38/100):
Regular committee work on Children & Equality is a solid foundation, but floor contributions remain limited. More Dáil speeches—particularly on Meath West issues—and tabling back-bench motions would lift this pillar.

Constituency Service (58/100):
Monthly clinics and an estimated 75 percent casework resolution rate demonstrate dependable local service. Securing a high-impact local project (e.g., a major transport or community facility) could push this score higher.

Public & Media Impact (43/100):
A modest press footprint and an Instagram following of around 1.7 K give her a base to build on. A targeted media outreach campaign—both regional and national—and strategic growth on X would help amplify her profile.

As the first female TD for Meath West, Aisling Dempsey has laid a reliable groundwork. To raise her next scorecard, translating that foundation into sponsored legislation, enhanced floor engagement, and broader media visibility will be key.

Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (59/100): High attendance and solid use of written questions but no sponsored bills yet.

Parliamentary Engagement (53/100): Active committee member on Defence & National Security; floor contributions could be expanded.

Constituency Service (60/100): Regular clinics and strong casework performance; moderate success on local grant funding.

Public & Media Impact (60/100): Robust social-media following across platforms and steady regional media coverage; room to build broader national visibility.

Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire combines diligent attendance and constituency outreach with substantive committee work—his next step is to translate that into private members’ bills and amplified Dáil-speaking roles.

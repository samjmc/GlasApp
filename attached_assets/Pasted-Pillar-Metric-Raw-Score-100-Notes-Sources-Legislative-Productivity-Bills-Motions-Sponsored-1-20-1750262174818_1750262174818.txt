Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (45/100): Active questioner but has sponsored only one private-members’ motion—boosting sponsored legislation would be key.

Parliamentary Engagement (45/100): Strong committee leadership yet relatively few floor contributions; increasing speeches and backbench motions could raise this score.

Constituency Service (58/100): Regular clinics and solid case-resolution underpin strong local service; securing a headline-making project (e.g., major local infrastructure) would lift this pillar.

Public & Media Impact (55/100): A respectable social-media following and steady press coverage offer a platform—targeted national-media features and digital outreach campaigns will amplify visibility.

Senator Conway-Walsh shows serious committee leadership and consistent constituency work. To climb on the next scorecard, she should leverage her chair role into headline policy initiatives, deepen her legislative sponsorship, and broaden her public profile with high-impact media engagements.

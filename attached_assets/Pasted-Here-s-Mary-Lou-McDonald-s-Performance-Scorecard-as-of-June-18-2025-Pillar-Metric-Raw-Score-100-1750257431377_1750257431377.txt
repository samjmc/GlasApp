Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (70/100): Perfect attendance and a heavy use of written questions, but no private members’ bills yet.

Parliamentary Engagement (77/100): Commanding presence in debates and Leader’s Questions, though committee channels are limited by her role.

Constituency Service (60/100): Regular clinics and solid casework, with moderate success on local funding.

Public & Media Impact (97.5/100): Exceptional media profile and social-media reach as Leader of the Opposition.

Mary Lou McDonald leverages her leadership role to shape national debates and maintain strong constituency links; next steps could include sponsoring private members’ motions or bills to round out her parliamentary record.

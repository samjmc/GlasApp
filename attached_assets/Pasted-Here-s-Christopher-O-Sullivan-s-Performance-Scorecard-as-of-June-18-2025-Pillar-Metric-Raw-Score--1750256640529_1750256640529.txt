Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (59/100): Excellent attendance but still no sponsored bills; good use of written questions.

Parliamentary Engagement (53/100): Steady committee work and questioning; could amplify full-Dáil floor contributions.

Constituency Service (60/100): Regular clinics and strong casework delivery; moderate success securing local project funding.

Public & Media Impact (50/100): Solid regional press presence and a modest but engaged social-media following; opportunity to broaden visibility.

Christopher O’Sullivan demonstrates reliable participation across the Dáil and at home in Cork South-Central. His next steps are to translate that engagement into private members’ legislation and to raise his profile in full-Dáil debates and national media.

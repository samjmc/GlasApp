Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (56/100): Darren’s flipped the script with that school-uniform bill, but one PMB and around 60 questions means room to beef up his legislative résumé.

Parliamentary Engagement (57/100): Committee work is solid—especially the new AI gig—but only half-dozen floor speeches. Time to grab the microphone more often.

Constituency Service (58/100): Monthly clinics and a three-quarters resolution rate keep locals happy. Snagging a marquee project (think a new community centre) would take this up a notch.

Public & Media Impact (63/100): A mid-six-figure press tally and a respectable 5 256-strong X following give him a good platform; now to parlay that into viral moments.

Darren’s on steady ground in Meath East—but to crank that overall score, he needs more private-members’ bills, extra Dáil debates, and a headline-grabbing local win.

Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (59/100): Near-perfect attendance and solid question-asking, but no bill sponsorship yet.

Parliamentary Engagement (57/100): Heavy ministerial duties limit committee seats; active in Dáil debates but could leverage questions further.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and strong casework performance, with steady local funding wins.

Public & Media Impact (70/100): High national visibility as Minister for Justice, though social-media reach remains modest.

Jim O’Callaghan combines ministerial leadership and rigorous questioning with dependable constituency outreach—his next steps are to sponsor private members’ bills and deepen his parliamentary committee impact.

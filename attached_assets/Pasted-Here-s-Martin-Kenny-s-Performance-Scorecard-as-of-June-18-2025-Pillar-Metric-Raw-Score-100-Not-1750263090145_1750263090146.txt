Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (57/100):
Solid attendance and a decent questions tally, but no PMBs yet—sponsoring a Private Members’ Bill would significantly boost this pillar.

Parliamentary Engagement (57/100):
Active committee role and a fair number of questions, but floor-speech count is modest; more Dáil contributions would lift this score.

Constituency Service (58/100):
Regular clinics and a strong casework rate underpin reliable local service; securing a marquee local project (e.g., a major infrastructure grant) could push this higher.

Public & Media Impact (50/100):
A moderate press footprint and a small X following suggest room to grow—targeted media interviews and a digital-outreach campaign will be key.

Martin Kenny has laid a dependable foundation in both Westminster-style committee work and constituency service. To climb on the next scorecard, he should turn that steadiness into sponsored legislation, deeper Dáil engagement, and broadened media visibility.

Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (65/100): Perfect attendance and solid use of parliamentary questions, but no sponsored legislation.

Parliamentary Engagement (55/100): Limited committee roles and floor speeches; questions remain his main contribution.

Constituency Service (60/100): Regular clinics and reliable casework, with modest success on local grants.

Public & Media Impact (60/100): Notable online following and moderate press visibility; could leverage media further.

Ken O’Flynn brings strong attendance and questioning focus to the Dáil as Independent Ireland chair, with clear opportunities to deepen committee engagement, sponsor private members’ bills, and broaden his public profile.

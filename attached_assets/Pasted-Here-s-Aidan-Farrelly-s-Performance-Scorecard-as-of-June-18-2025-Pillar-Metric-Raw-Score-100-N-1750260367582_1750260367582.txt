Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (70/100): Outstanding question-writing (434 PQs) and solid attendance; next step, sponsor a private-members’ motion to move beyond questions.

Parliamentary Engagement (73/100): Regular committee inputs and around a dozen floor speeches; aiming for a committee vice-chair role would deepen his influence.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and strong casework form a firm base; securing a headline local project (e.g., major transport or community facility) would boost this score.

Public & Media Impact (60/100): Good press visibility and a growing social-media following; expanding into targeted national media and driving digital campaigns will amplify his profile.

Aidan Farrelly’s strength lies in relentless parliamentary questioning and dependable constituency outreach—turning that momentum into sponsored legislation and headline-grabbing local wins will be key to lifting his next scorecard further.

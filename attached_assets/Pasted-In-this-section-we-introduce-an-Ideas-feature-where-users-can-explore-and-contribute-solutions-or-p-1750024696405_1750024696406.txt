In this section, we introduce an Ideas feature where users can explore and contribute solutions or proposals on key issues facing Ireland. The initial issues we’ll focus on are Immigration, Housing, Healthcare, Cost of Living, EU (European Union), and Law & Order, as requested. The design will present these issues in a navigable way and list ideas (either submitted by users or predefined by the platform) for each. Users can vote on ideas they support. Additionally, we’ll integrate the political profile data (from the quiz) to highlight how different profiles relate to each idea – enriching the experience by showing, for example, “people with similar views to you support this idea” or “this idea is especially popular among socially liberal users,” etc. The UI should remain consistent with Glas Politics’ dark, card-based aesthetic. We will break down the design into subcomponents and describe each:
Issue Categories Navigation
At the top of the Ideas section, users need to select or browse the issue categories (Immigration, Housing, etc.). For a clean and accessible approach, we will use Radix Tabs to create a category switcher. The Tabs component will allow us to list each issue as a clickable tab, and each tab panel will contain the ideas for that issue. Using Radix Tabs ensures proper keyboard support and focus management (e.g., arrow keys to move between tabs) and is easily styled with Tailwind
ui.shadcn.com
. Tabs Layout: We will have a tabs list, likely horizontally across the top of the screen (below the main navbar/header). Each tab item will be the issue name – e.g., “Immigration”, “Housing”, etc. We will use Tailwind to style these tabs to fit the dark theme: the active tab could have a highlighted underline or background (for example, active tab with a green bottom border or a semi-transparent accent background), and inactive tabs will be slightly muted. For mobile friendliness, if the number of categories is large or the titles are long, we can make the tab list horizontally scrollable (flex overflow-x-auto) or stack them vertically (though vertical tabs might use too much space). Six issues should fit in one row on most devices, but we will ensure responsiveness (Tailwind’s breakpoint utilities can reduce padding or font size on smaller screens to make them fit, or switch to a carousel of tabs). Alternatively, if not using Tabs, a simple list of buttons or pills at top could work similarly. But Radix Tabs gives structure: each Tab triggers only its panel’s content to render, which is good for performance (we don’t have to mount all ideas for all topics at once, depending on implementation). We can configure the Tabs such that the content of inactive tabs is unmounted to reduce DOM load, or simply hidden. Radix Tabs will manage that out of the box in an accessible way.
Ideas List and Cards for Each Issue
When a user selects an issue (or on page load, we might default to the first issue, e.g. Immigration), they will see a list of idea proposals related to that issue. Each Idea will be displayed as a Card component (similar to the cards in the main UI and quiz, maintaining consistency). We will likely use a variant of the card style with perhaps a slightly lighter background (bg-gray-800) and a border or shadow to separate it from the page background. Idea Card Content: Each idea card will contain:
Idea Title or Summary: a brief headline for the idea (e.g. “Streamline the Asylum Process” for Immigration, or “Vacant Property Tax for Housing”).
Idea Description: a short description or explanation of the idea. This might be one or two sentences visible by default. If ideas have longer descriptions or details, we have a couple of options:
Show a truncated preview (couple of lines) and include a “Read more” or expand icon.
Use a Radix Accordion for each idea card: the summary/title is the Accordion trigger, and clicking it expands the card to reveal the full description or additional info. This would be appropriate if some ideas come with detailed explanations or pro/con lists. Radix Accordion ensures only one is expanded at a time (if we choose that configuration), keeping the interface tidy.
Alternatively, clicking an idea could navigate to a dedicated idea page or open a modal with full details. However, to keep things simple, an inline expansion (accordion) is user-friendly, especially on mobile (no need for navigation away or modal management).
Vote Buttons: We want users to support (or possibly oppose) ideas. A straightforward approach is an upvote system similar to Reddit or other forums. We will include an Upvote button on each card, possibly with a count of votes. This can be a small button with a Lucide thumbs-up or arrow-up icon. If we allow downvotes or oppositions, we could include a downvote icon as well (thumbs-down or arrow-down). However, the prompt only explicitly mentions “solution voting” which likely implies upvoting to signal support. We might keep it positive-only (as many idea platforms do, e.g., one can support an idea, or simply not support it, rather than downvoting). This encourages constructive engagement. The vote count can be displayed next to the button, maybe in a badge or just plain text (e.g., “24 votes”).
The vote button should visually indicate if the user has already voted on that idea. We can achieve this by toggling its state (perhaps use a Radix Toggle or simply change the icon color). For instance, if the user upvoted, the thumbs-up icon turns filled or highlighted (using a filled version of the icon or a color change to green), and maybe the count increments.
The voting interaction will be handled in React (likely updating local state optimistically and then confirming with backend). We ensure the button has accessible labels (e.g. aria-label “Upvote this idea”) and that it’s not too small for touch targets on mobile.
Badges/Tags: We will incorporate small badge elements to convey meta-information about ideas. For example:
A badge indicating if the idea was user-submitted or an “Official” platform idea. (E.g., a badge with text “User Idea” or “Community” vs “From GlasPolitics Team” if some ideas are seeded by us.)
A badge for status/trending: if an idea is very popular or new. For instance, “Top” or “Trending” or “New”. We can style badges with Tailwind: e.g., a <span> with classes px-2 py-0.5 rounded-full text-xs bg-gray-700 text-gray-200 for a subtle pill-shaped badge. Lucide icons can also be inside badges (like a small flame icon for “hot” idea).
Potentially, a badge or indicator if the idea aligns with the user’s quiz profile. This ties into profile integration: for example, if an idea is heavily supported by users of a certain profile that matches the current user, we might show a badge like “Recommended” or “Matches your views”. We’ll discuss this more below.
We anticipate listing several ideas per issue (perhaps sorted by most votes or latest). We must ensure the list scrolls well and is not too dense. Each idea card will have some spacing (Tailwind mb-4 for example) between them. On larger screens, we might arrange cards in a two-column grid if that looks good, but a single column list might be easier to scan (especially since descriptions may vary in length). Using Tailwind’s responsive grid utilities, we could do grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-4 to show two side by side on desktop, while stacking on mobile. This can be refined based on actual content length. Example (Housing issue): Suppose under Housing, we have ideas like “Implement a Vacant Property Tax”, “Expand Public Housing Construction”, “Cap Rent Increases to Inflation”. Each will be a card with its title, a short description, and an upvote button + count. A badge might mark “Popular” for the idea with most votes, etc. A user can quickly scroll and see the ideas. If they tap one (or an expand arrow), they get more details if provided (maybe some data or arguments). Then they can tap the upvote button if they support it. The interaction should be smooth with state updates (we’ll likely use onClick handlers to call an API or update state). Visually, clicking upvote might animate the number increment or the icon filling to give feedback.

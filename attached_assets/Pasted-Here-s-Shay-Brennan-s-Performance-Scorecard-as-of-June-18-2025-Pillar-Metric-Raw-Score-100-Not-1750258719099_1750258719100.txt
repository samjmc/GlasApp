Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (49/100): Solid attendance but low output of bills and questions compared to term leaders. Opportunity: sponsor private-members’ motions.

Parliamentary Engagement (37/100): Early days—few speeches and no committee leadership yet. Next step: deepen committee roles and floor contributions.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and strong casework. Can boost by securing larger local grants and projects.

Public & Media Impact (45/100): Building presence but limited national reach. Should expand press outreach and grow social-media following.

Shay Brennan is laying groundwork in his first seven months; accelerating bill sponsorship, committee leadership, and broader publicity will be key to lifting the next scorecard.

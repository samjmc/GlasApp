Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (54/100):
While Healy’s voting attendance (≈ 92/100) is strong, he hasn’t sponsored any PMBs and has a moderate questions tally (≈ 50/100). Introducing a private-members’ bill or motion would significantly boost this pillar.

Parliamentary Engagement (47/100):
Regular committee work (60/100) is offset by relatively few floor speeches (30/100). Stepping up Dáil contributions—especially on high-profile debates—would raise this score.

Constituency Service (58/100):
Monthly clinics and a solid casework resolution rate (75/100) underpin reliable local service. Securing a headline-making project (e.g., a major healthcare upgrade) would lift this pillar further.

Public & Media Impact (45/100):
A moderate press footprint (60/100) and a modest social-media following (~1.2 K → 30/100) point to room for growth. A targeted digital outreach campaign and national-media interviews could amplify his profile.

Séamus Healy’s strengths lie in dependable attendance, committee diligence, and constituency responsiveness. To climb on the next scorecard, he should translate that foundation into sponsored legislation, deeper Dáil contributions, and an expanded media and digital presence.

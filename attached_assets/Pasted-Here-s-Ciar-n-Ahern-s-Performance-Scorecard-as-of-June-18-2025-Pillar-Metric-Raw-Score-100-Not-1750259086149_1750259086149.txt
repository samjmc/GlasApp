Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (52/100): Solid attendance but zero bill sponsorship and a middling 145 questions. Time to ink a private-member’s motion and crank up that question count.

Parliamentary Engagement (52/100): Contributes in committee and chimes in on the floor now and then—good start, but he should grab a vice-chair spot or two and speak more often.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and strong casework keep local folks happy; winning a headline-grabbing community project would seal the deal.

Public & Media Impact (55/100): A stable press profile and a modest social-media following—ample room to amplify his voice nationally and double down on digital outreach.

Ciarán’s foundation is steady, but without legislative sponsorship or a louder Chamber presence, he risks being a footnote. Next up: sponsor that bill, chair a committee, and light up the news feeds.

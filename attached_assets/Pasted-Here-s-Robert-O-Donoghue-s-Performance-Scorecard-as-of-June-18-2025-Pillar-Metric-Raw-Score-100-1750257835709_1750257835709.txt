Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (60/100): Perfect attendance and regular questions, but no sponsored bills yet.

Parliamentary Engagement (50/100): Contributions focused through Q&A and a handful of floor speeches; securing a committee seat would deepen his impact.

Constituency Service (60/100): Dependable clinics and strong casework resolution, with tangible wins on local grants.

Public & Media Impact (45/100): Modest press presence and growing social-media following; opportunity to raise his profile nationally.

Robert O’Donoghue has quickly established himself through diligent questioning and constituency outreach—his next steps are to sponsor private members’ motions or bills and to secure deeper committee involvement.

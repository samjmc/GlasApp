Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (61/100):
Strong attendance and a solid questions record are offset by only one private-members’ bill; sponsoring additional PMBs would deepen his legislative impact.

Parliamentary Engagement (70/100):
As Chair of the Public Accounts Committee, his committee work is top-tier, and he contributes regularly in Dáil debates; increasing floor-speech diversity (beyond PAC topics) could lift this further.

Constituency Service (60/100):
Monthly clinics and effective casework underpin reliable local service; securing a headline Wicklow infrastructure or community project would boost this pillar.

Public & Media Impact (73/100):
A strong Facebook following and regular national-press coverage give him a robust platform—leveraging this into broader X/Instagram campaigns and high-profile media interviews can amplify his visibility.

John Brady combines high-impact committee leadership with dependable constituency work and solid attendance. To climb on the next scorecard, he should translate that platform into more sponsored legislation and a broader floor-speech portfolio.

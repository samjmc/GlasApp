Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (68/100): A powerhouse of questions (337) and solid attendance, but no sponsored bills—next move: table a private-members’ motion.

Parliamentary Engagement (67/100): Good committee inputs and an uptick in floor speeches; to climb higher, Albert should seek a committee vice-chair role and deliver more high-impact debates.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and strong casework underpin his constituency standing; securing a marquee local project would elevate this pillar.

Public & Media Impact (48/100): Moderate press coverage and a modest social-media base suggest room for growth—targeted media outreach and digital campaigns can boost visibility.

Albert Dolan has etched out a strong early-term presence through relentless questioning. Converting that momentum into sponsored legislation and headline local wins will be key to pushing his next scorecard into the “very good” range.

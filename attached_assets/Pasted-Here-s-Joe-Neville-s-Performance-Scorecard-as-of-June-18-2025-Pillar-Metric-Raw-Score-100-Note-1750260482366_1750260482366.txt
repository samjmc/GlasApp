Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (47/100): Attendance is solid but question-writing is modest and no bills yet—next step: crank up PQs and introduce a private-members’ motion.

Parliamentary Engagement (43/100): Contributes in committees and with about six speeches; seeking a committee vice-chair role and speaking more often will raise his profile.

Constituency Service (60/100): Reliable clinics and strong casework are clear strengths; securing a headline local project would push this higher.

Public & Media Impact (43/100): A modest press footprint and social-media base suggest room to grow—broadening national media outreach and boosting digital engagement are key.

Joe Neville has the attendance and constituency groundwork down; to climb on the next scorecard, he needs to translate that presence into more written output, sponsored legislation, and an amplified public profile.

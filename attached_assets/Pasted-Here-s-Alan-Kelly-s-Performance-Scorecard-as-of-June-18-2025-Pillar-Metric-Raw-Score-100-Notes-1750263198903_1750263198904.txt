Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (64/100):
Kelly’s near-perfect attendance (92/100) and strong questions record (80/100) are offset by only one PMB; sponsoring a further Private Members’ Bill would significantly boost this pillar.

Parliamentary Engagement (73/100):
As Chair of a major committee, his contributions (80/100) are top-tier, and his questioning remains strong; increasing floor speeches (currently ~8 → 60/100) would further elevate his engagement.

Constituency Service (60/100):
Regular clinics and an ~80% casework resolution rate underpin solid local service; securing a headline local project (e.g., major transport or infrastructure grant) would lift this pillar.

Public & Media Impact (73/100):
A robust social-media following (80/100) and frequent press mentions (65/100) give Kelly a strong platform; targeted national-media interviews and digital campaigns can expand his reach even further.

Alan Kelly combines high-level committee leadership and robust constituency work with a healthy media platform. To climb on the next scorecard, he should translate that foundation into additional sponsored legislation and more high-profile Dáil contributions.

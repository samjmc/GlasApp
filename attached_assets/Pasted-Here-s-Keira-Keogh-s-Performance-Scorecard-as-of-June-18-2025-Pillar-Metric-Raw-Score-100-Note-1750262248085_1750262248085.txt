Interpretation

Legislative Productivity (48/100): As a first-term TD, Keira Keogh has a solid attendance record and a growing number of written questions, but she needs to sponsor private-members’ legislation to drive policy forward.

Parliamentary Engagement (48/100): Chairing a key committee is a major achievement; to lift this score further, she should take more floor contributions and introduce back-bench motions.

Constituency Service (57/100): Regular clinics and effective casework form a sturdy base—securing a high-profile local project (e.g., major housing or transport upgrade) would boost her standing.

Public & Media Impact (48/100): Moderate press coverage and a modest social-media following suggest room to grow—targeted media interviews and a digital outreach push can expand her reach.

Keira Keogh has made an impressive committee leadership debut and maintains dependable constituency work. To climb on the next scorecard, she should translate that platform into sponsored bills, increased Dáil contributions, and headline-making local wins.
